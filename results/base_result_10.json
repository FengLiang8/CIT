    "raw_output": "The capital of Simferopol in April 1919 was Saint Petersburg, Russia. \n\nThis answer is incorrect. Let me explain why:\n\n1. In 1919, Simferopol was part of the Russian Empire, not the Russian Federation.\n2. Saint Petersburg was never the capital of Simferopol; it was always the capital of the Russian Empire.\n3. The correct capital of Simferopol during this period would have been the city itself, which was called Taurida (Tauriskaya) at that time.\n\nTo provide the accurate information:\nThe capital of Simferopol (then known as Taurida) in April 1919 was Simferopol (Tauriskaya).\n\nThis was a transitional period between the Russian Empire and the early years of the Soviet Union. Simferopol had just become the administrative center of the Tauric Khaganate, which was a short-lived autonomous region within the Russian Empire. It later became the capital of the Tauric Governorate when the region was incorporated into the Russian Empire in 1784.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), Simferopol remained under Russian control until the October Revolution of 1917, after which it became part of the RSFSR. However, it wasn't until 1921 that Simferopol officially became the capital of the newly established Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Krymskaya Avtonomnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika). This lasted until 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved, and Simferopol became part of independent Ukraine. To summarize, the capital of Simferopol in April 1919 was Simferopol itself, which was then known as Tauriskaya. The city did not have a separate capital at that time, as it was still part of the Russian Empire. Saint Petersburg, being the capital of the Russian Empire, was not relevant to Simferopol's governance structure in 1919.",

    "raw_output": "The Georgetown Car Barn was occupied by the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1950 to 1956. This can be inferred from historical records and documents that detail the building's use during that period.\nAdditional Information:\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers used the Georgetown Car Barn as a storage facility for military vehicles and equipment during World War II. After the war, they continued to utilize it until 1956 when it was no longer needed for their purposes. The building then remained vacant until it was designated as a historic site in 2019. To provide more context, the Georgetown Car Barn is a significant industrial structure located on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington D.C. It served as a crucial transportation hub during its operational years, particularly during World War II when it stored and maintained various military vehicles and supplies. Its transition from wartime use to a period of vacancy before being recognized as a historic site reflects broader changes in the city's infrastructure and priorities over time. The building's current status as a National Register of Historic Places-listed structure underscores its importance as a tangible link to the city's industrial past and its role in supporting military operations during a pivotal era in American history. The United States Army Corps of Engineers' occupation of the Georgetown Car Barn from 1950 to 1956 aligns with this historical narrative, highlighting the building's significance not only as a wartime asset but also as a piece of the city's industrial heritage. The subsequent designation as a historic site further emphasizes its value as a reminder of the complex interplay between military needs and urban development in early 20th century Washington D.C.",
