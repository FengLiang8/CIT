It was founded on 1 September 1954 as Technische Hochschule für Chemie Leuna-Merseburg ( THC ) and closed on 31 March 1993 . Hochschule Merseburg was founded on the grounds of THLM in 1992 .\nHistory .\nTechnische Hochschule für Chemie Leuna-Merseburg was founded in a ceremony held in Halle ( Saale ) on 1 September 1954 . The first 207 students were registered on 19 October 1954 in the club house of Leuna chemical works , the mathematician Herbert Dallmann ( 1909–1996 ) was appointed as the first rector on this occasion , and the foundation stone of the Merseburg campus was laid . Despite the name of the new institution , it never had any facilities in Leuna ; the name only referred to the largest chemical plant in the GDR .\nThe institution was founded with the aim of creating a Technische Hochschule ( TH ) that offered an application-oriented education in chemistry-related sciences and technology and supported the chemical industry in Central Germany . It can be regarded as a late consequence of the World Wars in the 20th century , and of the economical and political situation of the GDR that required an accelerated development of the industry . Several other institutions of tertiary education were founded at the same time .\nOriginally intended to be located in Leipzig , the new TH was finally established in the smaller and quieter city of Merseburg , situated between two major chemical plants ( Leunawerke with ca . 30000 employees and Buna Werke Schkopau with ca . 20000 employees ) . It was originally attached to the Ministry of Heavy Industries , in December 1955 it was transferred to the newly founded Ministry of Chemical Industry and finally in February 1958 to the State Secretariat and later Ministry of Higher and Technical Education .\nStudents accommodation was provided in dormitories on the campus or in a short distance thereof . Dormitory places not used by THLM students were used for students of the associated specialist Abitur classes or the Industrieinstitut ( which prepared industry workers without Abitur for studies at university level ) and also for younger staff members .\nA festival week was held every five years following the foundation of the THLM . On occasion of its tenth anniversary it was awarded the new name Technische Hochschule für Chemie „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg by the Council of Ministers of the GDR , from 1975 on the name was shortened to Technische Hochschule „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg .\nThe library of THLM was the first in the new states of Germany after German Reunification that joined the data network Deutsches Wissenschaftsnetz founded in May 1990 . In November 1990 THLM became a member of German Rectors Conference . The government of Saxony-Anhalt decided in December 1990 to liquidate the institution . The result of an evaluation by the German Council of Science and Humanities in March 1991 was published in June . According to it , the departments of chemistry , process engineering and materials and processing technology were found to perform efficiently and competitively , and should join Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg ( MLU ) . Integration was completed in 1993 , when the employees of THLM became employees of MLU . Closure of THLM was\nlegally stipulated on 28 February 1992 and juridically completed on 31 March 1993 . Incidentally , the last rector , Alfred Göpfert , who had only assumed the office on 14 December 1992 , was also a mathematician .\nRectors .\n- Herbert Dallmann ( 1909–1996 ) , mathematician , 1954 - 1955\n- Eberhard Leibnitz ( 1910–1986 ) , chemist , 1955 - 1958\n- Heinz Schmellenmeier ( 1909–1994 ) , physicist , 1958 - 1961\n- Elmar Profft ( 1905–1978 ) , chemist , March 1961 - December 1961\n- Rolf Landsberg ( 1920–2003 ) , chemist , 1962 - 1964\n- Hans-Joachim Bittrich ( 1923–2010 ) , chemist , 1964 - 1968\n- Hans-Heinz Emons ( born 1930 ) , chemist , 1968 - 1975\n- Gert Naue ( born 1934 ) , engineer in fluid mechanics , 1975 - 1981\n- Margit T .

It was the predecessor of the later Faculty for Process Engineering and Fundamental Sciences which was formed in September 1958 and was awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in August 1959 .\nThe Faculty for Material Sciences was formed in July 1956 and awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in November 1957 . The first doctorate was awarded to Hans-Jürgen Papenfuß in January 1958 , the first honorary doctorate in November 1958 to H . H . Franck .\nThe Faculty for Engineering Economics was also formed in 1956 and was awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in April 1961 .\nThe faculties were subdivided into institutes . Among them were ( in order of their opening ) :\n- 1954 : Institute of Anorganic Chemistry ; Institute of Mathematics ; Division of Social Sciences ; university library ( initially with 3000 books )\n- 1955 : Institute of Organic Chemistry ; Institute of Analytical Chemistry ( the only one of its kind in the GDR ) ; Institute of Physical Chemistry ; Division of Language Education ; Division of Studentical Sports\n- 1956 : Institute of Technical Physics ; Institute of Political Economy ; Institute of Organisation and Planning of Chemical Plants ; Institute of Normatives and Standardisation ; Institute of Accountancy and Finances ; Industrial Institute\n- 1958 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Polymers\n- 1959 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Mineral Salts ; Institute of Petroleum Chemistry ; Institute of Chemical Metals ; Institute of Marxism–Leninism ; Institute of Material Sciences and Mechanical Technologies\n- 1960 : Institute of Economy of the Chemical Industry ; Institute of Process Engineering\n- 1962 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Fundamental and Intermediate Organic Chemical Products\n- 1964 : Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering , Apparatus Technology and Project Designing ; the Institute of Technical Physics was divided into the Institute of Automatisation of Chemical Processes and the Institute of Technical Mechanics and Fluid Mechanics\n- 1967 : Institute of Socialist Economic Management ; the Institute of Petroleum Chemistry and Organic Intermediates was formed from the Institutes of Petroleum Chemistry and of Chemistry and Technology of Fundamental and Intermediate Organic Chemical Products ; the Institute of Anorganic and Technical Chemistry was formed from the Institutes of Chemical Metals and of Chemistry and Technology of Mineral Salts\nThe research department of the pharmaceutical works Fahlberg-List in Magdeburg was attached to THC as Forschungsinstitut Magdeburg in 1955 .\nSpecialist classes for chemistry .\nTHC was the first institution of tertiary education in the GDR to establish specialist Abitur classes in 1964 , with a specialist focus on chemistry . There , students who had passed an entrance exam were accepted after finishing the ten-year secondary school , and received specialist instruction in the sciences , in particular in chemistry , on top of the ordinary extended secondary school curriculum . They were already integrated into the university structures , attended lectures and seminars and practical classes in the laboratory , and were to a large extent educated by university teachers .\nRestructuring .\nThe university reforms of the late 1960s in the GDR caused changes in the organisational structure towards greater centralisation . Institutes were transformed into sub-departments ( Wissenschaftsbereich ) and grouped into sections ( Sektion ) ( comparable to departments ) . The following sections were formed :\n- Chemistry\n- Process Chemistry\n- Process Engineering\n- Polymer Sciences ( Hochpolymere )\n- Socialist Economic Management ( SBW )\n- Cybernetics/Mathematics/Data Processing ( KMD )\nNew sections were formed in 1972 from the latter two :\n- Economics\n- Mathematics and Computing Technology\nIn 1976 , the Sections of Process Chemistry and of Polymer Sciences were dissolved and partly attached to the Section of Chemistry . At the same time two new sections were formed :\n- Physics\n- Materials Sciences\nThere existed also a Section of Marxism–Leninism which had no students of its own , but provided the then obligatory education in Marxism–Leninism for the students of all other sections .\nAfter the German reunification , the faculty structure was reintroduced . In 1991 , the following faculties existed :\n- Faculty of Sciences\n- Department of Chemistry\n- Institute of Analytical and Environmental Chemistry\n- Institute of Anorganic Chemistry\n- Institute of Organic Chemistry\n- Institute of Physical Chemistry\n- Institute of Technical Chemistry\n- Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\n- Department of Physics\n- Institute of Theoretical Physica\n- Institute of Experimental Physics\n- Institute of Applied Physics\n- Faculty of Technological Sciences and Mathematics\n- Department of Mathematics and Infoematics\n- Institute of Analysis\n- Institute of Applied Mathematics\n- Institute of Informatics\n- Computer centre\n- Department of Process Engineering\n- Institute of Technical Fluid Mechanics\n- Institute of Fundamentals of Process Engineering\n- Institute of Thermal Process Engineering\n- Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering\n- Institute of Reaction Technology\n- Institute of System Process Engineering\n- Institute of Thechnical Thermodynamics and Energy Management\n- Institute of Automatisation and Electrical Engineering\n- Institute of Technology of Environmental Protection\n- Institute of Biotechnology\n- Department of Materials and Processing Technology\n- Institute of Plastics and Rubber Technology\n- Institute of Processing Technology and Rheology\n- Institute of Materials Technology\n- Institute of Technical Mechanics\n- Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences\n- Department of Economy\n- Institute of Business Management\n- Institute of Interdisciplinary Technological Research\n- Institute of Foreign Languages\nLiterature .\n- Dietrich Werner , D .

    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant that has to respond to questions given a context.\n\nQuestion: What was the capital of Simferopol in Apr 1919?\n\nTemporal Context: \nSimferopol\nSimferopol ( ) is the second-largest city on the Crimean Peninsula , and the capital of the ( Autonomous ) Republic of Crimea . Simferopol is an important political , economic and transport hub of the peninsula , and serves as the administrative centre of both Simferopol Municipality and the surrounding Simferopol District . Founded on the site of a Crimean Tatar town Aqmescit , the city adopted its current name after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire . The population was\nEtymologies .\nThe name Simferopol ( ; ) comes from the Greek Sympheropoli ( , Symferópoli ) , meaning city of common good . The spelling Symferopil ( ) is also used .\nIn Crimean Tatar , the name of the city is Aqmescit , which means The white mosque ( Aq white , and mescit mosque ) . In fact , aq does not refer to the color of the mosque , but to its location . This is due to the color designation of the cardinal points among the Turkic peoples , where white is the west . Thus , the exact translation of the name of the town is the Western Mosque .\nIn English , the name was often given as Akmechet or Ak-Mechet ( e.g . in Encyclopædia Britannica ) , a transliteration from Russian spelling of Crimean Tatar word Акмечет , Ак-Мечеть , where Mechet ( Мечеть ) is the Russian word for mosque .\nHistory .\nEarly history .\nArchaeological evidence in the Chokurcha cave shows the presence of ancient people living in the territory of modern Simferopol . The Scythian Neapolis , known by its Greek name , is also located in the city , which is the remnants of an ancient capital of the Crimean Scythians who lived on the territory from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD .\nLater , the Crimean Tatars founded the town of Aqmescit . For some time , Aqmescit served as the residence of the Qalğa-Sultan , the second most important position in the Crimean Khanate after the Khan himself .\nRussian Empire .\nThe city was renamed Simferopol in 1784 after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire by Catherine II of Russia . The name Simferopol is in Greek , Συμφερόπολις ( Simferopolis ) , and literally means the city of usefulness . The tradition to give Greek names to places in newly acquired southern territories was carried out by Empress Catherine the Great as part of her Greek Plan . In 1802 , Simferopol became the administrative centre of the Taurida Governorate . During the Crimean War of 1854–1856 , the Russian Imperial Army reserves and a hospital were stationed in the city . After the war , more than 30,000 Russian soldiers were buried in the citys vicinity .\n20th-century wars .\nIn the 20th century , Simferopol was once again affected by wars and conflicts in the region . At the end of the Russian Civil War , the headquarters of General Pyotr Wrangel , leader of the anti-Bolshevik White Army , were located there . On 13 November 1920 , the Red Army captured the city and on 18 October 1921 , Simferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic .\nDuring World War II , Simferopol was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1 November 1941 to 13 April 1944 . Retreating NKVD police shot a number of prisoners on 31 October 1941 in the NKVD building and the citys prison . Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol , killing in total over 22,000 locals—mostly Jews , Russians , Krymchaks , and Romani . On one occasion , starting 9 December 1941 , the Einsatzgruppen D under Otto Ohlendorfs command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents ; most of them were Jews .\nIn April 1944 the Red Army liberated Simferopol . On 18 May 1944 the Crimean Tatar population of the city , along with the whole Crimean Tatar nation of Crimea , was forcibly deported to Central Asia in a form of collective punishment .\nWithin Ukraine .\nOn 26 April 1954 Simferopol , together with the rest of the Crimean Oblast , was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev .\nAn asteroid , discovered in 1970 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova , is named after the city ( 2141 Simferopol ) .\nFollowing a referendum on 20 January 1991 , the Crimean Oblast was upgraded an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 12 February 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR .\nSimferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic .\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Simferopol became the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within newly independent Ukraine . Today , the city has a population of 340,600 ( 2006 ) most of whom are ethnic Russians , with the rest being Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities .\nAfter the Crimean Tatars were allowed to return from exile in the 1990s , several new Crimean Tatar suburbs were constructed , as many more Tatars returned to the city compared to number exiled in 1944 . Land ownership between the current residents and returning Crimean Tatars is a major area of conflict today with the Tatars requesting the return of lands seized after their deportation .\nRussian annexation .\nOn 16 March 2014 , a referendum was held whose results showed that a majority of Crimeans voted in favour of independence of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia as a federal subject . The legitimacy of the referendums results has been questioned by several nations and independent news organizations . On 21 March , Simferopol officially became the capital of a new federal subject of the Russian Federation . The referendum was not recognized internationally , and the event was viewed by many as an annexation of the Crimean land by the Russian Federation .\nOn 14 September 2014 , municipal elections were held as part of the Russian Federation , the first elections since the Crimean status referendum of 16 March 2014 .\nGeography and climate .\nLocation .\nSimferopol is located in the south-central portion of the Crimean Peninsula . The city lies on the Salhir River and near the artificial Simferopol Reservoir , which provides the city with clean drinking water . The Simferopol Reservoirs earth dam is the biggest in Europe .\nClimate .\nThe city experiences a humid subtropical or oceanic climate ( depending on which version of the Köppen climate classification is used ) , near the boundary of the humid continental climate . The average temperature in January is and in July . The average rainfall is per year , and there is a total of 2,471 hours of sunshine per year .\nPolitics and administrative divisions .\nAs the capital of the Republic , Simferopol houses its political structure including the Parliament and the Council of Ministers . Simferopol is also the administrative centre of the Simferopolskyi District ( raion ) , however , it is directly subordinate to the Crimean authorities rather than to the district authorities housed in the city itself .\nThe city of Simferopol is administratively divided into three districts ( Zaliznychnyi , Tsentralnyi , and Kyivskyi ) , four urban-type settlements ( Ahrarne , Aeroflotskyi , Hriesivskyi , Komsomolske ) and one village ( Bitumne ) .\nViktor Ageev became city mayor on 11 November 2010 and was then elected chairman of the Simferopol City Council on 29 September 2014 .\nIgor Lukashyov was installed as the head of Simferopol City administration ( i.e . local executive ) after Russia annexed the region in 2014 . He served in this position until his dismissal on 9 November 2018 .\nTransportation .\nSimferopol has a major railway station , which serves millions of tourists each year . In December 2014 Ukraine cut the railway line to Crimea at the border . Currently , the station serves only a commuter ( regional ) passenger train and the Moscow – Simferopol train every day .\nThe city is also connected via the Simferopol International Airport , which was constructed in 1936 . Zavodskoye Airport is situated southwest of Simferopol .\nThe city has several main bus stations , with routes towards many cities , including Sevastopol , Kerch , Yalta , and Yevpatoriya . The Crimean Trolleybus connects Simferopol to the city of Yalta on Crimean Black Sea coast . The line is the longest trolleybus line in the world with a total length of ( since 2014 again ) .\nThe streets of Simferopol have a rare house numbering – the odd numbers are on the right side of the road , looking in the direction in which the numbers increase .\nDemographics .\nAt the last census in 2014 , the population of Simferopol was 332,317 , the highest of any city in the Republic of Crimea and second only to Sevastopol within the Crimean peninsula .\nEconomy .\nWhen it existed , Crimea Air had its head office on the grounds of Simferopol Airport . Simferopol hosts some industries , such as producing Marine automation control systems ; Precise electrical micro machines of low input power ; Power tools , for both professional and household usage .\n- Simferopol Airport , new terminal is to be open with at least 8 gates , the structure of the hall has a wave-like layout .\nIndustry .\n- Fiolent ( two locations )\n- Simferopol chemical industry plants\n- PO Foton\n- Simferopol Airport\n- SEM SElktroMash SELMZ\n- Plastotekhnika and else plastics related\n- Santekhprom SSTP\n- PEK PromElektroKontakt and PromSchitKontakt , ChPO Sfera IzmertelnPribor , SELTZ ElectroTechnical Plant\n- Pnevmatika , other pneumatics tires etc . related industry\n- Monolit SMZKon , TsSI Tavrida SKMKZ , Slava Truda SCMNG , SiMZ Motor Plants\n- Chornomornaftogaz\n- Digital Valley ( Tsifrovaya Dolina ) : silicon industry , computers , wafers and microelectronics , it , other related .

Among them is the largest university in Simferopol and Crimea , the Taurida V.Vernadsky National University , which was founded in 1917 . Crimea State Medical University named after S . I . Georgievsky , also located in Simferopol , is one of the most prominent medical schools of Ukraine . The Crimean Medical University is situated on the plot , where in 1855 a nursery garden was planted by the founder of the Nikita Botanical Gardens Ch.Ch.Steven ( 1781–1863 ) . In 1863–66 a school for girls was built here and in 1931 a medical institute was opened . On the same plot P.Krzhizhanovsky built a three-storey hostel for medical students after the design in 1934 . The building with clear geometric masses was completed in 1938 . A new federal university campus was opened 4 August 2014 .\nSports .\nSimferopol is home to the football club FC TSK Simferopol which plays in the Crimean Premier League .

    "question": "Which site was the heritage designation of Customs House, Sydney from Apr 1999 to Apr 2000?",
    "ground_truth": "New South Wales State Heritage Register",
    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant that has to respond to questions given a context.\n\nQuestion: Which site was the heritage designation of Customs House, Sydney from Apr 1999 to Apr 2000?\n\nTemporal Context: \nCustoms House , Sydney\nCustoms House , Sydney is a heritage-listed museum space , visitor attraction , commercial building and performance space located in the Circular Quay area at 45 Alfred Street , in the Sydney central business district , in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales , Australia . The building served as a customs house prior to Federation and then as the head office of New South Wales operations of the Government of Australia agency Department of Trade and Customs ( and its successors ) until 1988 . The customs function relocated to a new site in 1990 . The initial designs were by Mortimer Lewis and it was built during 1845 by under the administration of Governor Sir George Gipps . It is also known as Customs House ( former ) and Site of former Customs House . The site was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 ; and to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 .\nOwnership was transferred to the City of Sydney Council in 1994 , when it became a venue for exhibitions and private functions . After being refurbished in 2003 , it has also become the new home of the City of Sydney Library . The ground floor of the building houses a scale model of Sydneys city centre viewed through a glass floor . The model was built by Modelcraft in 1998 and weighs one tonne . Images of the various versions of the building across its history are also displayed on the ground floor .\nHistory .\nPeople of the Eora tribe are said to have witnessed from the site , in 1788 , the landing of the First Fleet . Convict David OConnor was hanged on the site in 1790 and it is said that his ghost haunts the Customs House to this day , offering people rum .\nThe first Customs house in Sydney was built in 1800 . Its location is presumed to be at or near the spot of the landing and official flagraising on the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 . This event marked the foundation of the colony of New South Wales . The site has been occupied by buildings ever since .\nThe driving force behind the construction of the later sandstone edifice on Circular Quay was Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes , the Collector of Customs for New South Wales for a record term of 25 years from 1834 to 1859 . Colonel Gibbes persuaded the Governor of New South Wales , Sir George Gipps , to begin construction of the Customs House in 1844 in response to Sydneys growing volume of maritime trade . The building project also doubled as an unemployment relief measure for stonemasons and laborers during an economic depression which was afflicting the colony at the time .\nThe site at Circular Quay was chosen in 1843 to house the Customs Service for the rapidly growing colony . They were responsible for all imports and exports , excise on locally manufactured goods , immigration control , control of narcotic substances and morally corrupt goods such as books and films . During the war years this included items of enemy origin , or having socialistic or communistic tendencies . Accordingly , areas for storage , administration and public business were included in the original design of the building . As trade increased , so did pressures on space within the Customs House and two new wings were constructed between 1883 and 1889 . These wings provided accommodation for the Shipping Office and Maritime Board . The Customs House opened for business in 1845 and replaced cramped premises at The Rocks . It was partially dismantled and expanded to three levels under the supervision of the then Colonial Architect , James Barnet , in 1887 . Various additions were made over the next century , particularly during the period of World War I , but some significant vestiges of the original Gibbes-Lewis building remain .\nThese demands increased again with the approach of Federation . Customs roles of immigration control and administration of tariffs were major reasons for Federation . They became , at this time , the major revenue raiser for the Commonwealth Government . Extensions were timed to coincide with the change in government . More floors were added to cope with new and expanding duties brought about by the massive political change . More revisions were made between 1915 and 1917 to further accommodate these changes and pressures brought about by the war .\nFew major structural changes have occurred between 1917 and 1995 . This reflects the movement of international shipping away from Circular Quay to other areas of the City and the State .\nFrom 15 June 1990 operations of the Customs Service were relocated to a new site . Ownership was then transferred from the Australian Government to the City of Sydney Council in 1994 . The building underwent several rounds of refurbishment . It was refurbished in 1996-7 to become a venue for exhibitions and private functions . A further round of refurbishment was completed in 1999 , converting the building into the tourism gateway to Sydney ahead of the 2000 Summer Olympics . The building contained galleries , a museum , bars , cafes and a restaurant , as well as performance and exhibition space . The City of Sydneys planning scale model of the City was also moved here from the Town Hall offices . After the Olympics , the building was further refurbished in 2003 to house the main City of Sydney Library , moved here from Town Hall . The site was refurbished and reopened in June 1997 as a combined commercial , performance , tourism and museum space .\nDescription .\nThe two-storey Georgian structure was designed by Mortimer Lewis and featured thirteen large and expensive windows in the facade to afford a clear view of shipping activity in Sydney Cove . Colonel Gibbes , who dwelt opposite Circular Quay on Kirribilli Point , was able to watch progress on the Customs Houses construction from the verandah of his private residence , Wotonga House ( now Admiralty House ) .\nThe building is a composite load-bearing and framed structure . The external masonry walls range from thick , with internal walls approximately . Internal beams vary in fabric from wood to steel . The load-bearing masonry on the perimeter of the building and the steel-framed structure in the core are fairly readily separable in the upper reaches of the building , though the edges of concrete floors do bear on the earlier masonry at the perimeter of the framed structure of the core . The panel walls contained in the 1917 frame are of brick . Floors in the perimeter building are generally suspended timber , joisted with added steel beams , while the framed core has reinforced concrete two-way slabs . Lift shafts exist on the central axis of the building .\nThe roof is a pitched roof on king-post trusses finished with Marseilles tiles of Australian make . Extensive box-gutters run around the perimeter of the 1903 roofs .\nInternal walls are finished with lime plaster , repaired with cement render . Some areas have significant plaster mouldings . Ceiling types are mixed . Window joinery , doors and architraves are generally french polished or varnished . Windows are timber , of french door and vertical sliding sash types , where overlooking the street .\nCondition .\nRecent conservation measures have returned the building to excellent physical condition . The archaeological potential is medium .\nModifications and dates .\n- 1885-1887 : James Barnet architect . Original building partially dismantled and rebuilt to three storeys with side wings , to form a U-shape in plan .\n- 1896-1903 : W.L . Vernon architect . Two phases of alterations resulting in the addition of two new floors and a wing in the rear courtyard , forming an E-shape in plan .\n- 19151-17 : George Oakeshott architect . All building enclosed by the former U-shape was replaced by a framed structure . This opened the ground floor as a large space with a lightwell . A sixth storey comprising caretakers quarters was added .\n- 1925-1990 : various additions by the Commonwealth Department of Works .\n- 1996-7 : Conservation and Refurbishment Project - opened June 1997 .\nHeritage listing .\nOn 22 June 2004 , the building was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List .\nThe Sydney Customs House occupies a unique symbolic and physical position on the site of the First Fleet Landing . Its location is a physical reminder of the importance of Circular Quay as the original maritime centre for the colony . The Customs House contains parts of the oldest surviving building of its type in Australia , used continuously for 145 years . It is a physical record of the history of the Customs Service and its importance in the history of Australia . The Customs House embodies the work of three successive and individually distinguished government architects : Mortimer Lewis , James Barnet and Walter Liberty Vernon .\nBecause of the scarcity of documentary evidence about the early stages of construction , the surviving building fabric from these stages constitutes the principal source of additional evidence about the early history of the building and its occupants .\nCustoms House , Sydney was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria .\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course , or pattern , of cultural or natural history in New South Wales .\nThe Sydney Customs House occupies a unique symbolic and physical position on the site of the First Fleet landing . This historical event has enormous significance to the history of Australia . Its location is a physical reminder of the importance of Circular Quay as the original maritime centre for the colony and is a significant symbol of British imperial sovereignty and colonial commercial expansion . The Customs Service was the only revenue collector in an outpost of Empire struggling for economic survival . It later became a watchdog over ideas , people and goods coming into the country . The internal and external growth and change of the building reflect these changes in use .\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales .\nThe Customs House embodies the work of three successive and individually distinguished official architects of New South Wales . Although Walter Liberty Vernon and James Barnet greatly altered the work of Mortimer Lewis , they did so using similar external materials and proportions so as to generate an overall unity of construction .\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social , cultural or spiritual reasons .\nThe site has significance as the initial point of European invasion of the lands of Aboriginal people .\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .\nBecause of the scarcity of documentary evidence about the early stages of construction , the surviving building fabric from these stages constitutes the principal source of additional evidence about the early history of the building and its occupants .\nThe place possesses uncommon , rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .\nThis site has been ranked as extremely significant in its unique reflection of the commercial expansion of the colony and the nationally significant role of the Customs Service .

    "ground_truth": "Coalition Avenir Québec in the riding of Richmond",
    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant that has to respond to questions given a context.\n\nQuestion: Which political party did André Bachand (Progressive Conservative MP) belong to from 2018 to 2019?\n\nTemporal Context: \nAndré Bachand ( Progressive Conservative MP )\nAndré Bachand ( born December 8 , 1961 ) is a Canadian politician , who represented the riding of Richmond—Arthabaska as member of the Progressive Conservatives from 1997 to 2003 .\nWhen the PC Party was merged with the Canadian Alliance into the Conservative Party in December 2003 , Bachand left the party and sat as an Independent Progressive Conservative until the 2004 election , and then retired from the House of Commons .\nBorn in Quebec City , Quebec , Bachand has been an administrator , and a business executive . He was the mayor of Asbestos , Quebec , from 1986 to 1997 , and was the Préfet of the MRC dAsbestos from 1987 to 1997 .\nFederal politics .\nYoung Turk .\nBachand was first elected as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1997 , one of five PC MPs elected that year in Quebec . Bachand was one of a handful of new Young Turk PC MPs ( along with Scott Brison , John Herron and Peter MacKay ) who were considered the future youthful leadership material that would restore the ailing Tories to their glory days . In 1998 , Jean Charest stepped down as federal Progressive Conservative leader to make the move to Quebec provincial politics , becoming leader of the federalist Quebec Liberal Party ( unaffiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada ) . Bachand was one of many who unsuccessfully tried to convince Charest to remain in federal politics for at least one more election . Joe Clark succeeded Charest as leader of the PC Party and Bachand was supportive of Clarks candidacy .\nDifficult times .\nThe Quebec-wing of the federal PC Party parliamentary Caucus wrestled with several internal policy issues in the late 1990s after Charests departure including the partys bilingualism policies and the autonomy of provinces in respect to federal powers . Shortly after Joe Clark was elected leader of the federal Tory Party , the federal government brought forward the Clarity Act . The Clarity Act was a Liberal Party of Canada sponsored Bill introduced by then Minister of Intergovernmental affairs Stéphane Dion . The Clarity Act detailed specifically how the province of Quebec could separate and under what conditions a separation could be legal . Clark chose to support Bachand and the Quebec PC Caucus MPs in the party and stated that he was against the Clarity Act while the fifteen other English MPs in the PC parliamentary Caucus voted in favour of the Bill regardless of Clarks stance .\nQuebec lieutenant .\nBy 1999 , Bachand had emerged as the nominal Quebec lieutenant of the Conservatives , attending most PC events in the province with Clark and acting as the partys chief spokesman for Quebec issues . Bachand also was the chief responder to the multiple defections of Quebec Tory party officials , MPs and Senators to the Liberal and Canadian Alliance Parties during this period . In September 2000 , three Quebec PC MPs , fearful of their re-election prospects under Clarks leadership , crossed the floor shortly before the federal election to sit as Liberal MPs , leaving Bachand as the only remaining PC MP in Quebec . He was subsequently re-elected in the 2000 election , as were all three of the MPs who crossed the floor . The Tories emerged from the election retaining party status .\nDeputy leader .\nIn February 2003 , Bachand announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives . However , on May 12 , he announced that he was dropping out of the race and supporting Peter MacKay . Bachand had been running fifth in the race , and had failed to gather support among party delegates and to raise enough money for his campaign . After MacKays victory , Bachand briefly served as Deputy Leader of the Progressive Conservatives until early December 2003 . Before becoming Deputy Leader , Bachand served as the Deputy House Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party , as well as its critic for the Intergovernmental Affairs , Industry , Science Research and Development , and the Deputy Prime Minister portfolios .\nLone independent .\nWhen the party merged with the Canadian Alliance at the end of 2003 , Bachand announced that he would retire from politics . Bachand did not sit with the new Conservative Party of Canada Caucus , and became an independent MP until the June 2004 election . During the June 2004 election , Bachand endorsed the Liberal candidate in the Richmond—Arthabaska race over the Conservative and Bloc Québécois challengers . The riding was ultimately carried by the BQ in their electoral sweep of the province .\nBachands departure from federal politics has been lamented by many Tories hailing from Quebec . In a Macleans article covering the March 2005 founding policy convention of the new Conservative Party , Senator Pierre Claude Nolin mused that if Bachand had remained elected and participatory in the new party , he may served as the new Conservative Partys chief Quebec lieutenant as part of Stephen Harpers attempts to woo Quebec voters .\nReturn to politics .\nIn September 2008 , Bachand announced that he would be the Conservative Party candidate for the district of Sherbrooke in the 40th Canadian General Election . On election night , Bachands comeback attempt was unsuccessful . He lost to Bloc Québécois incumbent Serge Cardin , finishing third with 16.4% of the vote .\nShortly after his election defeat , Bachand was appointed by Harper as Canadas ambassador to UNESCO in Paris . As ambassador , Bachands most high-profile activity was to oppose , on the Canadian governments behalf , the entry of the Palestinian Authority to membership in the organization .\nIn October 2011 , Harper appointed Bachand as his senior advisor on Quebec issues . The post , which previously had been combined with responsibility for being Harpers communications advisor , was reportedly separated from other responsibilities in order to make space for Bachand .\nIn 2013 , Macleans included Bachand as one of the thirteen members of Harpers inner circle , of most-trusted advisors , tasked to try to improve Conservative fortunes in Quebec .\nIn September 2013 , Bachand was hired by the Earnscliffe Strategy Group , an Ottawa public-affairs firm .\nProvincial politics .\nBachand ran for the Coalition Avenir Québec in the riding of Richmond , going on to win in the 2018 provincial election .\n\nAnswer:",

    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant that has to respond to questions given a context.\n\nQuestion: Which team was coached by Frank de Boer from 2018 to 2019?\n\nTemporal Context: \nFrank de Boer\nFranciscus de Boer ( ; born 15 May 1970 ) is a Dutch football manager who is the current head coach of the Netherlands national team . A former defender , De Boer spent most of his professional playing career with Ajax , winning five Eredivisie titles , two KNVB Cups , three Super Cups , one UEFA Cup , one UEFA Champions League and one Intercontinental Cup . He later spent five years at Barcelona , where he won the 1998–99 La Liga title , before retiring after short spells at Galatasaray , Rangers , Al-Rayyan and Al-Shamal .\nDe Boer is the second most capped outfield player in the history of the Netherlands national team , with 112 caps . He captained Oranje to the semi-finals of both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 . He is the twin brother of Ronald de Boer , with whom he was a teammate at Ajax , Barcelona , Rangers , Al-Rayyan , Al-Shamal and the Netherlands national team .\nAfter retiring from playing , De Boer went into management with the Ajax youth team and as assistant to Bert van Marwijk with the Netherlands national team . In December 2010 , he took over as manager of Ajax and went on to win the Eredivisie title in his first season . In 2013 , he received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title . The following year , he became the first manager to win four consecutive Eredivisie titles . He then had brief spells managing in Serie A with Internazionale in 2016 , Crystal Palace in the Premier League in 2017 , and Atlanta United in MLS in 2019 and 2020 , before becoming the current head coach of the Netherlands national team .\nClub career .\nAjax .\nDe Boer began his career as a left back at Ajax before switching to centre-back , a position he made his own for many years in the national team . He won both the 1991–92 UEFA Cup and 1994–95 UEFA Champions League while at Ajax , in addition to five Eredivisie titles and two KNVB Cups . However , after signing a six-year contract extension with Ajax for the 1998–99 season , he and his twin brother Ronald took successful legal action to have it voided . Ajax had a verbal agreement that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by , he would be released provided the other stayed . Ajax , however , apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the Champions League .\nBarcelona .\nIn January 1999 , Frank and Ronald de Boer signed for Spanish La Liga club Barcelona for £22 million , joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the Camp Nou . After winning the 1998–99 La Liga title , they were unable to repeat their earlier triumphs . In 2000 , Van Gaal was sacked by Barcelona and Frank suffered the ignominy of testing positive for the banned substance nandrolone a year later . He was suspended but he was reinstated after a successful appeal .\nLater career .\nDe Boer briefly moved to Galatasaray in the summer of 2003 before joining his brother at Rangers in January 2004 . He made his Rangers debut in a 1–0 win away at Partick Thistle , but in his second appearance for the club he missed the decisive penalty in the shootout as Rangers lost to Hibernian in the Scottish League Cup semi-final . He made a total of 17 appearances for Rangers , scoring two goals against Aberdeen and Dundee . The De Boer brothers left Rangers after UEFA Euro 2004 to play the rest of their football careers in Qatar with Al-Rayyan . De Boer announced his retirement from football in April 2006 .\nInternational career .\nHaving represented his national team 112 times , he was the most capped player in the history of the Netherlands national team , until Edwin van der Sar surpassed him . De Boer made his debut for the Netherlands in September 1990 against Italy .\nDe Boer also played for the Netherlands in the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups , and the 1992 , 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships . He is well-remembered for the arching 60-yard pass which allowed Dennis Bergkamp to score the last-minute goal that eliminated Argentina in the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup . During Euro 2000 , hosted in his home country and Belgium , De Boer reached another semi-final with the Dutch team . De Boer missed an important penalty kick in the first half of the semi-finals against 10-man Italy and another in the penalty shootout , which led to the Netherlands elimination from the tournament .\nOn 29 March 2003 , in a home match against Czech Republic , De Boer became the first Dutch male footballer to gain 100 caps . He ended his international career after an injury forced him to be replaced in a quarter-final match with Sweden at Euro 2004 . The injury ruled him out from the semi-final match against Portugal , which the Netherlands lost 2–1 .\nStyle of play .\nA talented and well-rounded world-class defender , in addition to his defensive skills , De Boer was also known for his pace , technical ability , accurate passing , and leadership , which enabled him to carry the ball out of defence , play it out from the back , or contribute to his teams offensive play by initiating attacks and creating chances for strikers with long balls . A versatile , intelligent , and elegant left-footed defender , with an ability to read the game and intercept loose balls , he was capable of playing both on the left and in the centre , and was even deployed as a sweeper . He was also a dangerous set-piece taker , renowned for his accurate bending free kicks from anywhere around the penalty area .\nManagerial career .\nIn 2007 , De Boer took up a coaching role at his former club Ajax where he was in charge of the clubs youth sector . During the 2010 World Cup , he was the assistant of the Netherlands national football team to manager Bert van Marwijk , together with retired player Phillip Cocu . The Dutch team reached the final of the tournament , losing to Spain .\nAjax .\nOn 6 December 2010 , after the resignation of Martin Jol , De Boer was appointed caretaker manager of Ajax until the winter break . His first game in charge was a Champions League match against Milan at the San Siro , a match Ajax won 2–0 through goals from Demy de Zeeuw and Toby Alderweireld . De Boer then went on to help Ajax become champions of the Eredivisie for the 2010–11 season in a 3–1 home victory over Twente , the champions of the previous year , on the final matchday , making the first year of his professional coaching career a golden one . I couldnt have wished for a more beautiful birthday present , said De Boer , as the clubs 30th championship was won on his 41st birthday .\nIn two-and-a-half years at the helm of Ajax , De Boer won three championships , making eight in total ( when including the five that he won as a player ) . According to reports , De Boer was offered the chance to interview for the Liverpool job but turned it down to remain with Ajax . I am honoured by the request [ from Liverpool ] but I have only just started with Ajax , he said . In 2013 , De Boer received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title .\nOn 27 April 2014 , De Boer won his fourth successive Eredivisie title with Ajax , the first manager ever to achieve this in the Dutch league . Moreover , it marked the first time Ajax has ever won four successive Eredivisie titles . De Boer has now won a total of nine Eredivisie championships with Ajax as a player and manager , another record ; Johan Cruyff , Sjaak Swart and Jack Reynolds all won eight Eredivisie championships with Ajax . Ajax finished the 2014–15 Eredivisie in second position , a massive 17 points behind champions PSV .\nOn 11 May 2016 , De Boer announced his resignation as manager of Ajax following a disappointing season when Ajax again lost out on the Eredivisie title to PSV on the final matchday of the season .\nInter Milan .\nOn 9 August 2016 , after the departure of Roberto Mancini , De Boer signed a three-year contract with Internazionale for the start of the 2016–17 season . De Boers first match in charge was Inters final pre-season friendly , a 2–0 win against Celtic on 13 August , played on neutral ground at Thomond Park , Republic of Ireland .\nThe club management board also approved expensive signings João Mário and Gabriel Barbosa for the team and De Boer ( they were in fact linked to Mancini and Inter in July ) , and the return to Turkey of recent acquisition Caner Erkin in the last days of transfer window . Gabriel , however , was rarely used in Serie A matches and could not be registered in European competitions due to a penalty imposed on Inter for breaching UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in previous seasons .\nDe Boers first competitive match was a 2–0 away loss to Chievo on 21 August . After the match , De Boer was criticized for using a three-man defence , a style that he had never used while at Ajax . Milan-based newspaper Corriere della Sera went as far as calling Inters performance a disaster . Fortunes soon turned , however , as Inter drew 1–1 against Palermo on 28 August , before winning three games in a row , against Pescara , title-holders Juventus and Empoli . The win against Juventus was highly praised , with De Boer being lauded for substituting Éder for Ivan Perišić , who provided the winning goal . Inters form would not last long , as the club would go on to lose against Roma , Cagliari and Atalanta .\nInter also struggled in the UEFA Europa League under De Boer , as they lost the opening match 0–2 at home against Israeli team Hapoel Beer Sheva on 15 September , and 3–1 against Sparta Prague on 29 September . Inter would then go on to finish last in their group with a total of six points , with three points under De Boer and another three under his successor .\nFollowing a run of four defeats in the last five Serie A matches , which left Inter in 12th place in Serie A , De Boer was sacked on 1 November , having been in charge for only 85 days . His last match was a 1–0 loss to Sampdoria on 30 October . Ironically , during a press interview in the annual general meeting of the shareholders of Internazionale on 28 October , CEO Michael Bolingbroke had confirmed that the club was 100% backing De Boer . ( Bolingbroke himself resigned a few days later .

He signed a three-year deal with the South London club , but was sacked 10 weeks later when Palace lost their first four league matches of the season without scoring a single goal – the first team in 93 years to have begun a top-flight season in such a fashion . He left having managed the team for only 450 minutes of game time of a Premier League team , making it the shortest reign of the Premier League era ( in terms of number of matches , rather than number of days ) . De Boers only win came in an EFL Cup second-round game , in which Crystal Palace won 2–1 against Ipswich Town . He was replaced by Roy Hodgson .\nWhilst at the club , De Boer attempted to implement a possession-based style of play ; after his sacking , he criticised the clubs players for their resistance to his approach , arguing that the club had signed only two players to fit his philosophy . Palace winger Wilfried Zaha commented on De Boers brief time at the club , stating There wasnt really the right mixture [ of players ] for the way we wanted to play .\nReferencing De Boers stint at Crystal Palace , José Mourinho described De Boer as the worst manager in the history of the Premier League .\nAtlanta United .\nOn 23 December 2018 , De Boer was announced as the head coach of Major League Soccer side Atlanta United , succeeding Gerardo Tata Martino to become the second head coach in the clubs history .

    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant that has to respond to questions given a context.\n\nQuestion: Fort McMurray was officially named what from Jun 1964 to Sep 1980?\n\nTemporal Context: \nFort McMurray\nFort McMurray ( ) is an urban service area in the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo in Alberta , Canada . It is located in northeast Alberta , in the middle of the Athabasca oil sands , surrounded by boreal forest . It has played a significant role in the development of the national petroleum industry . The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire led to the evacuation of its residents and caused widespread damage .\nFormerly a city , Fort McMurray became an urban service area when it amalgamated with Improvement District No . 143 on April 1 , 1995 , to create the Municipality of Wood Buffalo ( renamed the RM of Wood Buffalo on August 14 , 1996 ) . Despite its current official designation of urban service area , many locals , politicians and the media still refer to Fort McMurray as a city . Fort McMurray was known simply as McMurray between 1947 and 1962 .\nHistory .\nBefore the arrival of Europeans in the late 18th century , the Cree were the dominant First Nations people in the Fort McMurray area . The Athabasca oil sands were known to the locals and the surface deposits were used to waterproof their canoes . During the fur trade , the location of Fort McMurray , west of Methye Portage , was an important junction on the fur trade route from eastern Canada to the Athabasca Country . In 1778 , the first European explorer , Peter Pond , came to the region in search of furs , as the European demand for this commodity at the time was strong . Pond explored the region farther south along the Athabasca River and the Clearwater River , but chose to set up a trading post much farther north by the Athabasca River near Lake Athabasca . However , his post closed in 1788 in favour of Fort Chipewyan , now the oldest continuous settlement in Alberta .\nIn 1790 , the explorer Alexander MacKenzie made the first recorded description of the oil sands . By that time , trading between the explorers and the Cree was already occurring at the confluence of the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers . The Hudsons Bay Company and the North West Company were in fierce competition in this region . Fort McMurray was established there as a Hudsons Bay Company post by 1870 , named for the Chief Factor William McMurray . It continued to operate as a transportation stopover in the decades afterwards . The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway arrived in 1915 complementing existing steamboat service .\nThe community has played a significant role in the history of the petroleum industry in Canada . Oil exploration is known to have occurred in the early 20th century , but Fort McMurrays population remained small , no more than a few hundred people . By 1921 , there was serious interest in developing a refining plant to separate the oil from the sands . Alcan Oil Company was the first outfit to begin bulk tests at Fort McMurray . The nearby community of Waterways was established to provide a southern terminus for waterborne transportation when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached there in 1921 .\nAbasands Oil was the first company to successfully extract oil from the oil sands through hot water extraction by the 1930s , but production was very low . Fort McMurrays processing output gradually grew to over 1,100 barrels/day by World War II , and Fort McMurray was set up by the US and Canadian forces as staging ground for the Canol Project .\nFort McMurray and Waterways amalgamated as the village of McMurray ( the Fort was dropped until 1962 , when it was restored to reflect its heritage ) by 1947 , and became a town a year later . Fort McMurray was granted the status of new town so it could get more provincial funding . By 1966 , the towns population was over 2,000 .\nIn 1967 , the Great Canadian Oil Sands ( now Suncor ) plant opened and Fort McMurrays growth soon took off . More oil sands plants were opened , especially after the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis , when serious political tensions and conflicts in the Middle East triggered oil price spikes . The population of the town reached 6,847 by 1971 and climbed to 31,000 by 1981 , a year after its incorporation as a city .\nThe city continued to grow for a few years even after the oil bust caused by the 2003 collapse in world oil prices . The population peaked at almost 37,000 in 1985 , then declined to under 34,000 by 1989 . Low oil prices since the oil price collapse in 1986 slowed the oil sands production greatly , as oil extraction from the oil sands is a very expensive process and lower world prices made this uneconomical . Oil price increases since 2003 made oil extraction profitable again for around a decade , until another slump in oil prices which began in December 2014 and deepened in 2015 resulted in layoffs and postponement of projects .\nOn April 1 , 1995 , the City of Fort McMurray and Improvement District No . 143 were amalgamated to form the Municipality of Wood Buffalo . The new municipality was subsequently renamed the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo on August 14 , 1996 . As a result , Fort McMurray was no longer officially designated a city . Instead , it was designated an urban service area within a specialized municipality . The amalgamation resulted in the entire RM of Wood Buffalo being under a single government . Its municipal office is located in Fort McMurray .\nIn June 2013 , heavy rains caused the Hangingstone River to flood , causing a six-day state of emergency , a bridge collapse , the closure of highways 63 and 881 , and the evacuation of 150 people . The flooding was part of more widespread floods in southern Alberta .\nMay 2016 wildfire .\nOn May 3 , 2016 , a large wildfire burning southwest of Fort McMurray resulted in the mandatory evacuation of the community . Record-breaking temperatures , reaching , low relative humidity and strong winds contributed to the fires rapid growth in forests affected by an unusually dry and warm winter .\nUpwards of 88,000 people in the community and surrounding region were evacuated . It was Canadas largest recorded wildfire evacuation in history and third-largest recorded environmental disaster evacuation behind the 1979 Mississauga train derailment and the 1950 Red River flood .\nAbout one-fifth of homes in the community were reported to be destroyed in the fire .\nMay 2017 chlorine gas release .\nIn 2017 chlorine gas was released in Fort McMurray , after chemicals were mixed improperly at a water treatment plant . The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo was fined for the incident in 2020 .\nApril 2020 flood .\nOn April 27 , 2020 , massive ice jams along the Athabasca River resulted in a major flood . It devastated the downtown of Fort McMurray , submerging streets and ruining businesses , cars and houses , and completely wrecking a street , Manning Avenue .\nAround 13,000 people from Fort McMurray and the surrounding area were evacuated .\nGeography .\nFort McMurray is northeast of Edmonton on Highway 63 , about west of the Saskatchewan border , nestled in the boreal forest at the confluence of the Athabasca River , the Clearwater River , the Hangingstone River , and the Horse River . It sits at above sea level . Fort McMurray is the largest community in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo .\nWhite spruce , trembling aspen , balsam poplar and white birch are the most prominent native trees in and around town . Black spruce and tamarack occur in poorly drained areas and jack pine may be seen on the driest sites . European aspen , blue spruce and sand cherry are among the exotic trees occasionally seen .\nClimate .\nWith severe winters except during periods of warming chinook winds , mild to warm summers and only three months which average temperature is higher than , Fort McMurray has a borderline subarctic climate ( Köppen : Dfc ) , very slightly below to be considered a humid continental climate ( Dfb ) as May averages ; and falls into the Natural Resources Canada ( NRC ) Plant Hardiness Zone 3a .\nThe community lies at a lower elevation than most other parts of Alberta , so under the right conditions it can be a hot spot for Alberta , or even all of Canada ( as in April 1980 when its daily mean temperature of was unsurpassed by any other Canadian station ) .\nTemperatures range from an average of in January , to in July . The average annual precipitation is and falls mainly in the summer months . Average annual snowfall is , most of which falls between October and April .\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Fort McMurray was on July 18 , 1941 .

Generally , moves to Fort McMurray have increased in the last decade . Still , Albertans make up almost half the number of migrants to Fort McMurray , followed by 17% of people originating from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador .\nEconomy .\nFort McMurray is considered the heart of one of Albertas ( and Canadas ) hubs of petroleum production , located near the Athabasca oil sands . Besides the oil sands , the economy also relies on natural gas and pipeline transport , forestry and tourism . Oil sands producers include Syncrude , Suncor Energy , Canadian Natural Resources , and CNOOC Petroleum North America ULC . Fort McMurrays growth is characteristic of a boomtown . Housing prices and rents are far higher in Fort McMurray than most such remote areas , and in 2006 , Fort McMurray had the highest prices in Alberta . The Alberta government has promised to release more Crown land for residential construction , particularly in Timberlea on the north side .\nInfrastructure .\nAir .\nThere are several airports in the area , with Fort McMurray International Airport being the largest in northern Alberta . It is serviced by Air Canada , Air Canada Express , McMurray Aviation , Northwestern Air , WestJet and WestJet Encore , with scheduled flights to Calgary , Edmonton , Fort Chipewyan , Fort Smith , and Toronto . The airport is also serviced by various oil companies with corporate and charter flights heading north to private airstrips at oil sands operations . Flights are frequently booked to capacity because of the high transient worker population and workers who commute to Fort McMurray from other parts of Canada .\nPublic transit .\nFort McMurray Transit operates in the community , with routes that extend to all subdivisions on the south side and subdivisions on the north side .

Highway 881 also provides access to the region from Lac La Biche .\nRail .\nCanadian National Railway ( CN ) discontinued the Muskeg Mixed ( mixed train ) to Fort McMurray in 1989 , and there has been no passenger rail service since . CN continues to operate freight service on its line Lac La Biche and points beyond .\nMail .\nCanada Post identified Fort McMurray as having a particularly high cost to serve in January 2014 , and planned to institute a surcharge of $5.00 for all parcels shipped to the area . However , the postal service retracted this decision before the rate change went into effect .\nEducation .\nThe Fort McMurray Public School District ( FMPSD ) and Catholic School District both serve the primary , elementary , and secondary education needs of students in Fort McMurray .

    "question": "Who occupied Georgetown Car Barn from 1950 to 1956?",
    "ground_truth": "Georgetown University",
    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant that has to respond to questions given a context.\n\nQuestion: Who occupied Georgetown Car Barn from 1950 to 1956?\n\nTemporal Context: \nGeorgetown Car Barn\nThe Georgetown Car Barn , historically known as the Capital Traction Company Union Station , is a building in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington , D.C. , in the United States . Designed by the architect Waddy Butler Wood , it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the Capital Traction Company as a union terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines . The adjacent Exorcist steps , later named after their appearance in William Friedkins 1973 horror film The Exorcist , were built during the initial construction to connect M Street with Prospect Street .\nIntended for dual use as a passenger station and as a storage house for the streetcars , the Car Barn began Washingtons only cable car system . Almost immediately after the building opened , the system was electrified , and the Car Barn was converted to accommodate electric streetcars . Throughout its history as a terminal and storage facility , the Car Barn was never utilized to the extent anticipated by its construction .\nThe building has undergone several renovations , the most extensive in 1911 , when the original Romanesque Revival façade was significantly modified , and the interior was almost completely gutted . Not long after its opening , the building fell into disrepair . Changing ownership over time , it maintained its original function of housing streetcars until 1950 , when it was redeveloped as office space . Among its occupants was the International Police Academy , an arm of the Central Intelligence Agency , which operated out of the Car Barn in the 1960s and 1970s . Today , it is used as an academic building by Georgetown University . In 2019 , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .\nHistory .\nThe Car Barns original foundation supported a warehouse constructed in 1761 to store tobacco for auction unloaded from ships docked at the location of the present-day Key Bridge . The warehouse was converted to keep horses and their trolleys around 1861 . On August 23 , 1894 , Congress authorized the extension of an existing trolley line terminating at the intersection of Bridge and High Streets ( now Wisconsin Avenue and M Street respectively ) to the intersection of M and 36th Streets . With the authorization , Congress required that a union station be erected at the site . Thereafter , the site was used to store horse-drawn trolley cars .\nConstruction .\nConstruction on the building then known as Union Station began in early 1895 under the architectural direction of Waddy Butler Wood . The superintendent and chief engineer of the Capital Traction Company , D.S . Carll , was in charge of the construction . Before construction of the Car Barn , the two streets were joined by a steep hillside that carried 36th Street . Large amounts of earth were excavated— in total—resulting in the sharp cliff that exists today . Adjacent to the Car Barn are a set of stairs commonly known as the Exorcist steps and a large retaining wall , which were built at the time the Car Barn was constructed , to connect M and Prospect Streets . The steps are so named as they provided the location for the scene in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist where the priest is thrown down the stairs to his death .\nThe buildings construction was opposed by the next-door resident of the Prospect House , who furnished affidavits by prominent architects stating that blasting from the construction was damaging her house ; this led to court-ordered supervision of the blasting in 1894 . After the Car Barns construction , the large edifice obstructed the view of the Potomac River and Virginia from homes on Prospect Street , including the well-known cottage of E . D . E . N . Southworth . For this reason , some considered it a desecration of the local scenery .\nThe three-story , building was opened on May 27 , 1897 , containing offices for the several tenant trolley companies and waiting rooms that were decorated with red oak wainscot panelling , ornate iron stair railings , and stuccoed ceilings . The exterior was designed in the Romanesque Revival style . Its tower , which reached a height of , contained an elevator that shuttled passengers between the terminals . Many of the buildings decorations reflect its original function . The pediment facing M Street reads Capital Traction Company and contains three decorative flywheels .\nThe M Street-facing first floor served the Washington and Georgetown Railroad . The second and third floors were connected with steel trestles to allow for trolleys coming across the Potomac River from Rosslyn , which served Washington , Arlington , Falls Church , and were projected to serve the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad . The roof , which was level with Prospect Street , was used by the Metropolitan Railroad and had a covered walkway for passengers to get from the elevator to Prospect street .\nThe station operated as Washingtons only cable car trolley terminal for less than a year . Almost immediately after opening , the Car Barn was converted to operate the new electric streetcars . The Virginia lines never made use of the terminal , and the Metropolitan Railroad did not use the station to the extent intended . It intended to place storage tracks on the roof of the building but never did .\nRe-design .\nAlthough regarded as well-designed before 1900 , the Car Barn began a period of deterioration and neglect lasting for 50 years . The first stage of the transition from a trolley station to an office building was carried out between 1906 and 1908 when portions of the second floor were converted into office space . The electrification of streetcars necessitated a large-scale re-design of the Barn , which began in 1910 . The entrances to the building were extended to accommodate the larger cars , and a new elevator was installed to lift streetcars to the roof . This transition required a near-complete reconstruction of the building . The steel support beams were replaced , and the entire façade was changed to extend toward M Street and increase its height to allow more office space . These modifications were complete in 1911 .\nFurther conversions of track space to office space occurred between 1921 and 1922 . Extensive remodeling occurred again in 1933 with the designation of the Car Barn as the headquarters of the new Capital Transit Company , as a result of the merger between the Capital Traction Company and the Washington Railway and Electric Company , which increased the number of office workers at the building . These changes involved removing the roof in the center of the building , creating a lightwell on the third floor , converting the third floor into office space , and removing the covered passageway on the roof .\nLater uses .\nThe last streetcar operations at the Car Barn ended with the closure of the Rosslyn–Benning Line on April 30 , 1949 . The building continued to store streetcars until May 1950 . Toward the end of 1952 , the first floor was converted into office space .\nWhen the Capital Transit Company merged with its competitors , the building came under the ownership of its new corporate successor , the DC Transit System , in 1956 . By then , the building had fallen into such a state of disrepair that the company deliberated over whether to demolish it entirely . Seeking to preserve the historic structure , it elected to redevelop it . The building underwent considerable interior renovations between 1957 and 1960 , intended to turn the structure entirely into an office building . This involved lowering the ceilings , which were previously designed to accommodate the height of the streetcars . The building was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1967 .\nBeginning in late 1963 , the Car Barn was home to the International Police Academy , operated by the Central Intelligence Agency ( though officially part of the Agency for International Development ) that trained Latin American police forces ; members of these forces met at the Car Barn until the program was shut down in 1975 .\nIn 1992 , the owner of the DC Transit System , O . Roy Chalk , was subject to foreclosure , and the building came under the ownership of the Lutheran Brotherhood . The Car Barn was purchased in 1997 by Douglas Development Corporation—which continues to own the building—and it was renovated the following year . The primary tenant is Georgetown University , which first began leasing space in the 1950s . After two years of renovation by the university that ended in 2017 , the first floor garage was converted to house the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Georgetown University Press . The building today has four floors and has a floor area of . The Car Barn was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on January 24 , 2019 , and the National Register of Historic Places as part of a multiple property submission named Streetcar and Bus Resources of Washington , DC on August 9 , 2019 .\n\nAnswer:",
