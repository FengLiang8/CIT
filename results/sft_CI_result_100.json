This indicates that before 2002, there were multiple heads or in-charges for Atlanta. The next entry shows that from 1982 to 1990, the situation was unknown, suggesting that this period did not involve a specific person holding the title. However, after 1994, the entry specifies that from 1994 to 2002, the head or in charge was Bill Campbell. This implies that while Campbell was involved, he was not the one in charge during the specified time frame.\nThe subsequent entries show that from 2002 to 2010, the head or in charge was Shirley Franklin. This directly answers the question, as she held the position during the specified years (2002-2010). The later entry regarding Keisha Lance Bottoms from January 2018 to January 2019 does not affect the answer because it pertains to a different time period and does not overlap with the 2002-2010 timeframe mentioned in the question.\nTherefore, the correct answer is derived from the overlapping period where both Maynard Jackson and Shirley Franklin were in charge, but the question specifically asks about the period from 2002 to 2010, which is covered by Shirley Franklin's tenure.

According to the temporal context, during this period, Laurence Harvey's spouse was Paulene Stone.

    "raw_output": "<causal_reasoning>\nThe temporal context provides three distinct periods related to the GER Class T26 operators. From 1891 to December 1922, the operator was Great Eastern Railway. This period covers the early years of the railway system before World War I. The next entry states that from 1923 to December 1947, the operator was London and North Eastern Railway. This directly overlaps with the first period and specifies the time frame during which the operator was Great Eastern Railway. The third entry, from 1948 to 1959, mentions that from 1948 to 1959, the operator was British Railways. This is another overlapping period but focuses on a different time frame than the first two.\nThe logical flow is straightforward: the first period overlaps with the second, and the second period overlaps with the third.
