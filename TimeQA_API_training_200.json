    "story": "Simferopol\nSimferopol ( ) is the second-largest city on the Crimean Peninsula , and the capital of the ( Autonomous ) Republic of Crimea . Simferopol is an important political , economic and transport hub of the peninsula , and serves as the administrative centre of both Simferopol Municipality and the surrounding Simferopol District . Founded on the site of a Crimean Tatar town Aqmescit , the city adopted its current name after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire . The population was\nEtymologies .\nThe name Simferopol ( ; ) comes from the Greek Sympheropoli ( , Symferópoli ) , meaning city of common good . The spelling Symferopil ( ) is also used .\nIn Crimean Tatar , the name of the city is Aqmescit , which means The white mosque ( Aq white , and mescit mosque ) . In fact , aq does not refer to the color of the mosque , but to its location . This is due to the color designation of the cardinal points among the Turkic peoples , where white is the west . Thus , the exact translation of the name of the town is the Western Mosque .\nIn English , the name was often given as Akmechet or Ak-Mechet ( e.g . in Encyclopædia Britannica ) , a transliteration from Russian spelling of Crimean Tatar word Акмечет , Ак-Мечеть , where Mechet ( Мечеть ) is the Russian word for mosque .\nHistory .\nEarly history .\nArchaeological evidence in the Chokurcha cave shows the presence of ancient people living in the territory of modern Simferopol . The Scythian Neapolis , known by its Greek name , is also located in the city , which is the remnants of an ancient capital of the Crimean Scythians who lived on the territory from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD .\nLater , the Crimean Tatars founded the town of Aqmescit . For some time , Aqmescit served as the residence of the Qalğa-Sultan , the second most important position in the Crimean Khanate after the Khan himself .\nRussian Empire .\nThe city was renamed Simferopol in 1784 after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire by Catherine II of Russia . The name Simferopol is in Greek , Συμφερόπολις ( Simferopolis ) , and literally means the city of usefulness . The tradition to give Greek names to places in newly acquired southern territories was carried out by Empress Catherine the Great as part of her Greek Plan . In 1802 , Simferopol became the administrative centre of the Taurida Governorate . During the Crimean War of 1854–1856 , the Russian Imperial Army reserves and a hospital were stationed in the city . After the war , more than 30,000 Russian soldiers were buried in the citys vicinity .\n20th-century wars .\nIn the 20th century , Simferopol was once again affected by wars and conflicts in the region . At the end of the Russian Civil War , the headquarters of General Pyotr Wrangel , leader of the anti-Bolshevik White Army , were located there . On 13 November 1920 , the Red Army captured the city and on 18 October 1921 , Simferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic .\nDuring World War II , Simferopol was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1 November 1941 to 13 April 1944 . Retreating NKVD police shot a number of prisoners on 31 October 1941 in the NKVD building and the citys prison . Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol , killing in total over 22,000 locals—mostly Jews , Russians , Krymchaks , and Romani . On one occasion , starting 9 December 1941 , the Einsatzgruppen D under Otto Ohlendorfs command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents ; most of them were Jews .\nIn April 1944 the Red Army liberated Simferopol . On 18 May 1944 the Crimean Tatar population of the city , along with the whole Crimean Tatar nation of Crimea , was forcibly deported to Central Asia in a form of collective punishment .\nWithin Ukraine .\nOn 26 April 1954 Simferopol , together with the rest of the Crimean Oblast , was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev .\nAn asteroid , discovered in 1970 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova , is named after the city ( 2141 Simferopol ) .\nFollowing a referendum on 20 January 1991 , the Crimean Oblast was upgraded an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 12 February 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR .\nSimferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic .\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Simferopol became the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within newly independent Ukraine . Today , the city has a population of 340,600 ( 2006 ) most of whom are ethnic Russians , with the rest being Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities .\nAfter the Crimean Tatars were allowed to return from exile in the 1990s , several new Crimean Tatar suburbs were constructed , as many more Tatars returned to the city compared to number exiled in 1944 . Land ownership between the current residents and returning Crimean Tatars is a major area of conflict today with the Tatars requesting the return of lands seized after their deportation .\nRussian annexation .\nOn 16 March 2014 , a referendum was held whose results showed that a majority of Crimeans voted in favour of independence of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia as a federal subject . The legitimacy of the referendums results has been questioned by several nations and independent news organizations . On 21 March , Simferopol officially became the capital of a new federal subject of the Russian Federation . The referendum was not recognized internationally , and the event was viewed by many as an annexation of the Crimean land by the Russian Federation .\nOn 14 September 2014 , municipal elections were held as part of the Russian Federation , the first elections since the Crimean status referendum of 16 March 2014 .\nGeography and climate .\nLocation .\nSimferopol is located in the south-central portion of the Crimean Peninsula .

He served in this position until his dismissal on 9 November 2018 .\nTransportation .\nSimferopol has a major railway station , which serves millions of tourists each year .

    "story": "Robert Crewe-Milnes , 1st Marquess of Crewe\nRobert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes , 1st Marquess of Crewe , ( 12 January 185820 June 1945 ) , known as The Lord Houghton from 1885 to 1895 and as The Earl of Crewe from 1895 to 1911 , was a British Liberal politician , statesman and writer .\nEarly life .\nRobert Offley Ashburton Milnes was born at 16 Upper Brook Street , Mayfair , London , the only son of Richard Monckton Milnes , 1st Baron Houghton , by his wife the Hon . Annabella Crewe , daughter of John Crewe , 2nd Baron Crewe , and was educated firstly at Winton House , near Winchester , and then Harrow . He went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , graduating in 1880 .\nPolitical career .\nA Liberal in politics , Milnes became Assistant Private Secretary to Lord Granville in April 1883 when Granville was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . In an 1884 by-election he was the losing Liberal candidate at Barnsley . As Baron Houghton he was made Liberal whip in 1885 . In January 1886 he was made a Lord-in-waiting to Queen Victoria during the Third Gladstone ministry , and remained a Home Ruler .\nPrepared for ministerial success , a severe blow was struck to a burgeoning political career : his wife Sybil Marcia , daughter of Sir Frederick Ulric Graham , 3rd Baronet of Netherby , whom he had married on 3 June 1880 , died suddenly in September 1887 , still only thirty years old . He was determined to get over this personal tragedy by studying agriculture at Cirencester . However , he was prevented by illness from pursuing his studies . Leaving England , he travelled to Egypt where the Stray Verses were written in a somewhat mournful lament at his great loss . Further melancholy hit hard when his eight-year-old son and heir Richard died in 1890 .\nReturning to Houghton in 1892 , he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the Liberal Government of 1892–1895 , in which his old friend Lord Rosebery eventually became Prime Minister . John Morley served as Chief Secretary .\nOn the death of his uncle , Hungerford Crewe , 3rd Baron Crewe , he inherited vast estates of nearly 50,000 acres in four counties , and assumed the same year the additional surname of Crewe by royal licence on 8 June 1894 . On 17 July 1895 he was created Earl of Crewe , in the County Palatine of Chester .\nOn 20 April 1899 he married an eighteen-year-old society beauty , Lady Mary Etrenne Hannah Primrose , daughter of the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery .\nThe Second Boer War broke out only months later in October . Crewe remained a leader of the conciliators who to the last tried to find a negotiated settlement with President Kruger . He began to grow apart from his father-in-laws Liberal imperialism , advocating a gradualist step-by-step policy of containment of the situation . But the war soon escalated with Crewe finding himself isolated . He was not much of an orator , but had skills in administration , proving an efficient organizer . He became increasingly influential with Henry Campbell-Bannerman and the Radicals . He made a personal friend out of H . H . Asquith , who was his political mainstay in the round of intrigues that intensified during the lead up to the First World War . A close confidante he was appointed as an aide on almost every committee . From 1905 to 1908 he was Lord President of the Council in the Liberal government . The Lords , dominated by Tory Peers , were hostile to Asquiths proposed reforms . They wrecked the Education Bill of 1906 , while Crewe stood out as the main defender of the Cabinets policy . In response to pleas from Campbell-Bannerman he assumed the role of cross-party convenor . Crewe was a moderate in all things . He deplored Lloyd Georges Limehouse Speech in the east end of London in support of the Peoples Budget . By the same token he found it unacceptable for die-hard Tories and Unionists to continue to block legislation .\nAlthough Elgin reassured him of Winston Churchills friendliness among Liberals , Crewe was in for a rude shock : he had succeeded the orientalist Lord Elgin as Secretary of State for the Colonies , and in May 1908 he had an angry exchange of letters with Churchill who had intervened in a colonial debate in the Commons . Crewe could be haughty and coldly disapproving : alike to Grey he took a dim view of Lloyd Georges Peoples Budget . It was Crewes job to steer it through the Lords . In his capacity as Leader of the House of Lords he played a key role in bringing the Parliament Act 1911 ( depriving the Lords of its veto ) to the floor of the house and eventually onto the statute book . Asquith valued him highly as a colleague , for his common sense and sound judgment rather than any exceptional brilliance . But when Churchill circulated a memorandum proposing the abolition of the Lords in 1910 , Crewe remained essentially whiggish and cautious , blocking any attempt to change the bicameral relationship . He sat on the Constitutional Conference Commission set up on 16 June 1910 during the crisis following Edward VIIs death . The inconclusive outcome of the January 1910 election , which increased Unionist representation in the Commons , caused a wide-ranging debate on the constitutional implications of the Lords powers . The new King , George V , to obviate a stalemate agreed to create 500 new peers , should the Liberals win the December 1910 election . Crewe was present at the discussions as one of the Inner Sanctum in the cabinet . He had previously taken a more right-wing position with Asquith arguing for reform of the membership of the Upper House , rather than of its customary powers . Crewe was selected to face leading Tory Lord Cromer , and the Archbishop of Canterbury , in negotiation of the provisions of the Veto bill , which would give a whip hand to an elected Commons .\nIt was his colonial responsibilities from September 1910 as part of his terms as Secretary of State for India ( 1910–11 and 1911–15 ) , for which he gained the hoped for promotion in the peerage . The Delhi Durbar was an invention of his genius for organization , designed to the last detail for the first British monarch in history to pay a visit to India . In that post , he was responsible for the removal of the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi , and the reunion of the two Bengals under a Governor-in-Council , as well as commissioning the architect , Sir Edwin Lutyens for his outstanding visionary grand design of New Delhi . He was further honoured in 1911 when he was created Earl of Madeley and Marquess of Crewe .\nIn at least one of Asquiths cabinet lists 1913–14 , Crewe was at the top ; but other ministers , like Churchill , were more thrusting at pushing themselves forward for promotion . Crewe was widely respected for his administrative competence , efficiency and personal intelligence . Crewe served as Lord President of the Council again from May 1915 , coming second in Asquiths rankings and working closely with Lloyd George on currency and exchange rate stabilisation in the budget . His home at Crewe House , Curzon Street in Mayfair became a centre for war propaganda .\nIn 1916 he was appointed briefly as President of the Board of Education , and may have been useful in the post-war educational sector , but the coalition split in December . He remained as ever , an Asquithian , declining office under Lloyd George , and after his resignation he continued to lead the independent Liberal opposition in the House of Lords . He took the largely honorific title of Chairman of London County Council . He maintained a leading role in the education sector , serving as Chairman of the Governing Body of Imperial College London ( 1907–22 ) , and Chancellor of Sheffield University . He was later Ambassador to France appointed by Bonar Law from October ( 1922–28 ) . As Ambassador to France , he launched a fund for the creation of a British Institute in Paris , which has since developed into the University of London Institute in Paris ( ULIP ) . He had a very brief ten-week stint as Secretary for War in MacDonalds National Coalition from August 1931 , but did not hold office after the general election . The Samuelite Liberals withdrew over free trade from the National Coalition in 1932 . From 1936 and throughout the Second World War Crewe was leader of the Independent Liberals in the House of Lords . He served as Lord High Constable of England for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth .\nPublic-speaker .\nHe did not much like public speaking , but that was probably because he contrasted sharply with Lloyd Georges firebrand delivery and populist demagogy . Crewe himself tended to hesitate too long time with pregnant pauses , as his speech became stilted . He was above all fastidious in the royal tradition of Charles I . Edwin Montagu claimed , somewhat sardonically , that one of his female constituents died of boredom listening to the Marquess . His father-in-law , Lord Rosebery , had been Liberal Leader six years before he himself became Leader in the House of Lords of that party . Rosebery thought Crewe a reliable politician but a poor speaker . When it was announced to him that his daughter , the Marchioness of Crewe , was in labour , Rosebery is said to have quipped I hope that her delivery is not as slow as Crewes . Always at ease in London High Society , Crewe hosted the dinner party at which Winston Churchill met Clementine Hozier .\nPolitical positions .\nCrewe voiced his support during his time in Parliament for numerous reforms , including old-age pensions , an eight-hour day for miners , and meal provisions for schoolchildren . In November 1905 , Crewe had written to ( then ) Party leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman of the need for innovative reform on the part of the Liberals , noting that\nMore than ever before , the Liberal Party is on its trial as an engine for securing social reforms , - taxation , land , housing , etc . It has to resist the I.L.P . claim to be the only friend of the workers . Can it do this and attempt Home Rule as well ?\nDuring the Liberal party crises of 1886 , 1909–11 , and 1916 , he stayed loyal to the party . He was also said to have acknowledged the damage the First World War did to liberalism . When he died the 4th Marquess of Salisbury described Crewe as the best of the whig statesmen . One historian believed his whiggery was more temperamental than ideological . Reserved and stiff upper-lipped by nature he sought compromise by mediation attempting to negotiate a middle way . His meetings were often spontaneous and informal , but dominated by an aristocratic clique : Lloyd George recalled how in 1912 Crewe had tried at Deeside to resolve Ulsters longstanding problems with Bonar Law over a round of golf .\nLiterary work .\nCrewe inherited his fathers literary tastes , and published for public consumption Stray Verses in 1890 , besides other miscellaneous literary work , including Gleanings from Béranger ( privately printed in 1889 ) , much of which he translated . A war poem , —which touches on the theme of what might have been—was published in several anthologies during and following World War I . Lord Crewe was the last of the Liberal grandees at the end of Empire . He was essentially by character a Victorian , and this showed in his austere reverential writings that took few risks with the material .\nSoon after the death of his father-in-law the 5th Earl of Rosebery in 1929 , the family asked Crewe to write his biography . The two-volume Lord Rosebery was published by John Murray in 1931 . Crewes dedication reads To my wife - this attempt to tell the story of one we both loved .\nDeath .\nCrewe died on 20 June 1945 at the age of 87 . His body was buried in the graveyard of Saint Bertolines Church in the Cheshire village of Barthomley . As he had no surviving male heir , both his sons ( one from each marriage ) having died in childhood , his titles became extinct upon his death .\nFamily .\nCrewe married twice . In 1880 , he married Sibyl Marcia Graham ( 1857–1887 ) , daughter of Sir Frederick Graham , 3rd Baronet , of Netherby in the County of Cumberland . They had three daughters and one son , who died as a child :\n- Lady Annabel Crewe-Milnes ( 1881–1948 ) . She married twice . In 1903 , she married Arthur ONeill ( 1876–1914 ) , later Ulster Unionist MP for Mid Antrim . Their third son , Terence ONeill , was to become Prime Minister of Northern Ireland . Her second marriage was to Hugh Dodds to whom she bore two sons , the writer Quentin Crewe and Colin Crewe .\n- Hon . Richard Charles Rodes Milnes ( 1882–1890 ) , died in childhood .\n- Lady Celia Hermione Crewe-Milnes ( 1884–1985 ) , twin with her sister Cynthia . She married Sir Edward Clive Milnes-Coates , 2nd Baronet .\n- Lady Helen Cynthia Crewe-Milnes ( 1884–1968 ) . Twin with her sister Celia . She married the Hon . George Charles Colville ( 1867–1943 ) and was mother of Sir John Colville who served as a Private Secretary to Neville Chamberlain , Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee .\nIn 1899 , more than a decade after his first wifes death , the 41-year-old Crewe married again . At eighteen years of age , the bride was around the same age as Crewes eldest daughter . She was Lady Margaret Etrenne Hannah ( Peggy ) Primrose , daughter of the 5th Earl of Rosebery . As Lady Crewe , she became one of the first seven women appointed as magistrates in 1919 following the passing of the Sex Disqualification ( Removal ) Act 1919 . They had two children , a son and a daughter , and again the son died in childhood . The children were :\n- Richard George Archibald John Lucian Hungerford Crewe-Milnes , Earl of Madeley ( 1911–1922 ) ,\n- Lady Mary Evelyn Hungerford Crewe-Milnes ( 1915–2014 ) , first wife of the 9th Duke of Roxburghe .\nExternal links .\n- Milnes , Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography .",

    "story": "ACS Poli Timișoara\nAsociația Club Sportiv Poli Timișoara ( ) , commonly known as Poli Timișoara , is a Romanian professional football club based in Timișoara , Timiș County , currently playing in the Liga III .\nThe club is credited as the official record holder and legal successor of the original club founded in 1921 , FC Politehnica Timișoara , which went bankrupt and was dissolved , following the 2011–12 season . It is co-owned by the City Council and the County Council and has the backing of the Politehnica University of Timișoara , all three being active members in the legal entity running the club .\nThe team has won two Romanian Cups and was twice a runner-up in Liga I . It is ranked 5th in the Liga I All-Time Table , with 48 seasons played .\nPoli Timişoara traditionally plays in white and purple kits , although it has used variations of black and white in the past . The clubs current home ground is Electrica stadium , although most of its history it played on Dan Păltinișanu Stadium .\nHistory .\nBeginnings of Politehnica Timișoara ( 1921–1945 ) .\nThe club was founded in 1921 by the Polytechnic University of Timișoara under the name Societatea Sportiva Politehnica .\nIts initial aim was to provide an opportunity for university students to work on their fitness within a competitive environment . The logistics of the sport proved problematic , as there were limited financial means available . Thanks to contributions gathered from university professors and employees , the club bought their first football kits , with white-black vertical stripes , and rented the Patria football stadium . It was not until 1928 that the club developed its own training grounds , Politehnica , which were built by volunteers . Players for the team were chosen on merit from the pool of Timișoara students and high-schoolers , who trained after school hours during the week and played football on weekends . The football landscape in the city was already developed at that time , with CAT , RGMT and Chinezul dominating locally .\nAfter spending three years in the District Championships II , Politehnica won promotion to the first tier in 1924 , by defeating Kadima Timișoara . The club became established in the years to come , even finishing 2nd in the 1926–27 District Championships I , when Politehnica lost out to Chinezul by a single point , who were one of Romanias most famous football names at the time . However , the competitive level could not be easily sustained by a university club , as it was subject to the inflow and outflow of players conditioned by their student status . After a decline towards the end of the decade , the low-point came at the beginning of the 1930s , between 1931 and 1933 , when due to insufficient material resources , Politehnica had to suspend its football activities . It reappeared in 1934 but remained a modest club , with mid-table classifications in the District Championships I , as well as the Divizia C and Divizia B , once they were founded . As war beckoned , the national championships were suspended and all football activities reduced to friendly matches and the Cupa Eroilor ( 1943–44 ) .\nUntil the second World War , Politehnica was far from the number one Timișoara football club . Chinezul and then Ripensia won multiple Romanian championship , whereas the students club failed to achieve similar results . It did , however , propel several players to the Romania national football team , with the likes of Sfera , Ignuţa , Deheleanu , Chiroiu , Pop , Protopopescu and Sepi all wearing the national jerseys .\nEstablishment as one of the citys most representative clubs ( 1945–1991 ) .\nWith Romania under a communist regime , these decades were a challenge for Politehnica , as the club represented an educational institution of the highest tier . The numerous promotions and relegations between the first two national leagues were contrasted by the two Romanian cups won and the clubs first forays into international football .\nPolitehnica was first promoted to Romanian top league , the Divizia A , in 1948 , and played under the name CSU Timișoara in the first season . Shortly thereafter ( from 1950 ) , the club was renamed Știința Timișoara , in line with the desired nomenclature of the times . In spite of suffering its first relegation in 1951 , the decade was an unusually consistent one , with the club returning swiftly to the top division and staying there until the season 1959 . The high-point of the Ştiinţa years was winning the 1957–58 Romanian Cup , a 1–0 victory against Progresul București , with the club finishing joint first in the league in the same season , but losing out on goal difference .\nThe next decade saw the club struggle to remain in the first league , particularly towards the end of the 60s . However , it was then that the clubs modern identity started taking shape . Firstly , in 1963 , the largest stadium in Timişoara was completed . It was initially named 1 Mai , honoring the socialist workers day , before being renamed several times in the 90s and finally settling on Stadionul Dan Păltinişanu . Secondly , the club reverted to its previous name of Politehnica Timișoara in 1966 and went to play during the next five decades on the then-erected stadium .\nWhen Politehnica returned to the first league in 1973 , after struggling to win promotion for several years , it went on to celebrate one of its best streaks in the top flight . With the likes of Emeric Dembrovschi and Dan Păltinişanu in the team , who both played for Romania and went on to become some of the most capped players in the clubs history , and under the management of prof . Ion V . Ionescu , Politehnica lost that seasons cup final . After managing a third place in the league with manager Angelo Niculescu in 1978 , Politehnica took part in a continental competition for the first time . It was the 1978–79 UEFA Cup , where Poli defeated MTK Budapest ( 2–0 and 1–2 ) , before going down to Honved Budapest ( 2–0 and 0–4 ) in the second round .\nThe club remained steady and managed to win its second cup trophy the following season , by beating Steaua București with 2–1 , after extra time . Politehnica thereby qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup , where it managed to eliminate Celtic Glasgow ( 1–0 and 1–2 ) , before being defeated by West Ham United ( 1–0 and 0–4 ) in second leg . In spite of losing another Romanian Cup final in 1981 , the club qualified once more for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup , where they lost to Leipzig 2–5 on aggregate .\nAfter being relegated in 1983 , Politehnica yo-yo-ed between Divizia A and the Divizia B , with promotions in 1984 , 1987 , 1989 and relegations in 1986 and 1988 . Fans ironically called this period as the ABBA years . As the Romanian Revolution , which started in Timișoara , signalled the end of an era , Politehnica managed to grab its most impressive result yet in European competitions , by eliminating Atlético Madrid ( 2–0 and 0–1 ) in the 1990–91 UEFA Cup .\nPrivatization and detachment from the Polytechnic University ( 1991–2001 ) .\nBy state order , all public institutions were forced to relinquish and reorganize any owned sports clubs in 1991 , to effectively privatize them . As a result , alongside the newly organized football club appeared a non-profit association , AFC Politehnica Timișoara . The latter , consisting of previous club players and staff , was mandated with owning and protecting the club records and intellectual property .\nThe clubs swan song near the top of Romanian football for the next decade was to be the 1991–92 season . Poli finished 5th and also reached the Romanian Cup final , only to lose it on penalties against Steaua București . The consequent participation in the 1992–93 UEFA Cup , saw the club draw against Real Madrid ( 1–1 in Timișoara ) , before being defeated in the return leg ( 0–4 ) . Politehnica lost several key players in the years after the forced privatization , which slowly lead to the teams downfall . In fewer than twenty four months from their draw against Real , the club was relegated to the Divizia B in 1994 . Despite a fast return to the first league in 1995 , Poli failed to consolidate their position and were soon relegated once more after the 1996–97 season .\nAn inability to rebound lead to mounting financial pressures . The club was temporarily owned by a Timișoara based businessman between 1998 and 2000 , before the local authorities accepted the bid of an Italian investor , Claudio Zambon , to take over Politehnica . Despite an initial financial outlay , Poli finished 15th and was relegated to the third league , Divizia C , where it had last played in 1938 . To avoid such an outcome , Zambon and the local authorities struck a deal with a league two club , Dacia Pitești , and purchased their license to participate in the Divizia B . After failing to earn promotion to top flight , the 2001–02 season posed an insurmountable challenge for Politehnica . Zambons departure following disagreements with the local authorities meant the club found itself in dire financial straits . Forced to use mostly youth players , Politehnica finished the season dead last , with one win and four draws to its name , but negative eight points in the standings , due to unpaid debts . Once again the club was bound to be relegated to the third division .\nIdentity crisis , glory years and downfall ( 2002–2012 ) .\nIn 2002 , AEK Bucharest were promoted to Liga I , Romanian footballs top division , for the first time , whereupon Anton Doboș , the clubs owner , moved it to Timișoara . It was renamed Politehnica AEK Timișoara after merging with CSU Politehnica , a club owned and run by the Politehnica University , and received the full support of local authorities and white-purple fans . After a rocky first season , which required a spectacular relegation play-off against Gloria Buzău to avoid demotion , Poli AEK consolidated during the next season , finishing on a safe mid-table position . Moreover , starting with the 2004–05 season , the team changed its name to FCU Politehnica Timișoara , trying to reestablish its former identity .\nFinancially difficulties looming , Politehnica changed ownership once more . Former president Anton Doboș stayed on at the club for another year in a new position , while Balkan Petroleum Ltd. , owned by Marian Iancu , took full charge . Significant investments in the transfer market transformed the club overnight , as it received the nickname EuroPoli for its newly found ambitions to reach the top of Romanian football .\nDuring the takeover by Marian Iancu , a dispute regarding the proprietary rights for the club name , colors and records arose . After prolonged litigation , Politehnica was forced to change its name to FC Timișoara , following a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport . It was deemed that the colors and records dating before 2002 were lost in favor of former Politehnica Timișoara owner , Claudio Zambon . The Italian had struck a deal with AFC Politehnica , the non-profit association which owned said proprietary items , when he left Timișoara during the 2001–02 season .\nResults on the pitch improved immediately after the takeover , but a leap to the Liga 1 podium proved elusive until 2008–09 , when Politehnica finished runner-up , a feat repeated two seasons later . The club did , however , rejoin European football the season before that by qualifying for the UEFA Cup – sixteen years after its last appearance against Atletico Madrid . More European appearances followed , culminating with the qualification for the 3rd preliminary round of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League . The team defeated the reigning UEFA Cup champions Shakhtar Donetsk , but were eliminated from the competition during the Playoff Round , which still meant the club would take part in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League group stage .\nIn November 2010 , the Romanian Court of Appeal returned Politehnicas name , colors and records to FC Timișoara . However , at the end of the season , despite finishing second in the Liga I standings , the club was relegated to Liga II after failing to meet the licence requirements to play in the first division . Under the name of Politehnica Timişoara , they took part in the 2011–12 Liga II season and finished first , but were again denied the licence to play in Liga I . Consequently , the club filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved in September 2012 .\nRebirth as ACS Poli Timișoara and recent years ( 2012–present ) .\nIn the summer of 2012 , ACS Recaș , a club just promoted to the Liga II , was moved to Timișoara and renamed ACS Poli Timișoara after the dissolution of FC Politehnica Timișoara . The new club is co-owned by the City Council and the County Council and has the backing of the Politehnica University of Timișoara , all three being active members in the legal entity running the club . However , the ultras supporters rejected the move and decided to support an alternative project in the lower leagues , ASU Politehnica Timişoara .\nValentin Velcea continued as head coach , while the roster consisted mostly of the core ACS Recaș players and several players from FC Politehnica . At its conception , the club , established as an NGO , was primarily financed by the local authorities , as Timișoara mayor Nicolae Robu insisted control should not be forfeited to private investors . After initially playing in black/white/yellow kits , in order to avoid legal complications while the court ruled over the rightful owner following the bankruptcy of FC Politehnica , the club returned to its historic white-purple colors starting with the 2015–2016 season . As of February 2016 , ACS Poli Timişoara is the sole and full owner of all the rights pertaining to and deriving from the Politehnica Timișoara brand and records , following a court decision which nullified the original agreement between the founding club and record holders , and Marian Iancus insolvent club .\nFrom a competitive perspective , the club failed to equal the achievements of the Marian Iancu era . A yo-yo-ing between the first two leagues , reminiscent of the Politehnicas travails in the 1980s , ensued . The situation was amplified by the fact that the financing received from the local authorities was deemed illegal in the summer of 2015 , which left the club without its main financial benefactor . The highlight season for the new Poli came about in 2016–2017 , when the club started with a 14 points penalty , as it failed to reach a points minimum the previous year and recorded unpaid debts . In spite of this , Poli , under the management of Ionuţ Popa , rallied to reach the relegation play-off in the dying minutes of the season and defeated rivals UTA Arad 5–2 on aggregate . Moreover , the club reached the first national cup final , finishing runner-up in the Cupa Ligii , while also reaching the semi-finals of the Romanian Cup .\nThe following season was another struggle and Poli suffered a reversal of fortunes as they were relegated by courtesy of a goal scored late in the last matchday . With financial pressures mounting , the club declared insolvency during the 2018–2019 Liga 2 season and struggled to stay competitive , becoming involved in another fight to avoid relegation . In order to mitigate costs , it was also forced to relocate from the Dan Păltinişanu stadium to the Electrica stadium .\nSupporters and Rivalries .\nHistorically , Poli has been the most prominent football club in Timișoara after 1945 , playing consistently in either the first or the second tier of Romanian football . Local rivalries with CFR Timișoara and UM Timișoara were relevant until the early 2000s . Afterwards , the former was relegated to a semi-professional status in the lower leagues and the latter was dissolved in 2008 .\nNationally , there were strong rivalries with UTA Arad and Dinamo București . The matches against UTA were labeled as the West Derby , due to the proximity of Timișoara and Arad . Matches against CFR Cluj , FCSB , and Universitatea Craiova also drew large crowds .\nAfter the club reincarnated as ACS Poli in 2012 , the core factions of the ultras movement decided to support an alternate club in the lower leagues , ASU Politehnica Timișoara . ACS Poli struggled to fill the void created by their departure , with smaller fan factions forming to support the club . Although top-bill matches with historic rivals still attract fans to the stadium , attendances have dropped compared to the averages attained in the 2000s .\nHonours .\nLeagues .\n- Liga I\n- Runners-up ( 2 ) : 2008–09 , 2010–11\n- Liga II\n- Winners ( 12 ) : 1947–48 , 1952 , 1959–60 , 1964–65 , 1972–73 , 1983–84 , 1986–87 , 1988–89 , 1994–95 , 2001–02 , 2011–12 , 2014–15 ( record )\n- Runners-up ( 2 ) : 1970–71 , 2012–13\nCups .\n- Romanian Cup\n- Winners ( 2 ) : 1957–58 , 1979–80\n- Runners-up ( 6 ) : 1973–74 , 1980–81 , 1982–83 , 1991–92 , 2006–07 , 2008–09\n- Cupa Ligii\n- Runners-up ( 1 ) : 2016–17\nManagers .\n- Valentin Velcea ( Aug 15 , 2012–Oct 10 , 2013 )\n- Aurel Șunda ( Oct 10 , 2013–Mar 16 , 2014 )\n- Dan Alexa ( Mar 16 , 2014–Aug 21 , 2015 )\n- Florin Marin ( Aug 25 , 2015–Mar 21 , 2016 )\n- Petre Grigoraș ( Mar 25 , 2016–May 22 , 2016 )\n- Ionuț Popa ( May 24 , 2016–Feb 5 , 2018 )\n- Leo Grozavu ( Feb 6 , 2018–Apr 15 , 2018 )\n- Adrian Neaga ( Apr 16 , 2018–Jun 30 , 2018 )\n- Ionel Ganea ( Jul 1 , 2018–Aug 20 , 2018 )\n- Ștefan Nanu ( Aug 27 , 2018–Dec 13 , 2018 )\n- Valeriu Răchită ( Dec 13 , 2018–Jun 30 , 2019 )\n- Silviu Bălace ( Sep 4 , 2019–present )\nPlayers .\nAppearances .\nAs of 1 March 2019\nGoalscorers .\nAs of 1 March 2019\nExternal links .\n- Official website\n- Club profile on UEFAs official website",

He said : I deny all the information published by the media and I assure you that it is a misinterpretation of my words and behavior.. . The biggest criminals have a right to anonymity unless a court decides otherwise . I was deprived of that . Mass media have already judged me and sentenced me .

    "story": "Audie Murphy\nAudie Leon Murphy ( 20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971 ) was an American soldier , actor , songwriter , and rancher . He was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of World War II . He received every military combat award for valor available from the U.S . Army , as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism . Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off a company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945 , then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition .\nMurphy was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County , Texas . His father abandoned them , and his mother died when he was a teenager . Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family ; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family .\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 , Murphys older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military . Turned down initially for being underweight by the Army , Navy and the Marine Corps , he eventually was able to enlist in the Army . He first saw action in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily ; then in 1944 he participated in the Battle of Anzio , the liberation of Rome , and the invasion of southern France . Murphy fought at Montélimar and led his men on a successful assault at LOmet quarry near Cleurie in north-eastern France in October .\nAfter the war , Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career . He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film To Hell and Back , based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name , but most of his roles were in westerns . He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith . Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter . He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona , and became a regular participant in horse racing .\nSuffering from what would today be described as post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow . He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills . In his last few years , he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example . Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971 , which was shortly before his 46th birthday . He was interred with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery , where his grave is one of the most visited .\nEarly life .\nAudie Murphy was born on 20 June 1925 , in Kingston , a small rural community in Hunt County in northeastern Texas . He was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy ( 1887–1976 ) and his wife Josie Bell Murphy ( née Killian ; 1891–1941 ) . The Murphys were sharecroppers of Irish descent .\nAs a child , Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper . He grew up in northeastern Texas around the towns of Farmersville , Greenville , and Celeste , where he attended elementary school . His father drifted in and out of the familys life and eventually deserted them . Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day ( ) to help support his family ; he also became skilled with a rifle , hunting small game to help feed them . After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941 , he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store , garage and gas station in Greenville . Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Childrens Home , a Christian orphanage in Quinlan . After the war , he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband , Poland Burns . His other siblings briefly shared the home .\nThe loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life . He later stated :\nWorld War II service .\nMurphy had always wanted to be a soldier . After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 , he tried to enlist , but the Army , Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage . After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year , he was accepted by the U.S . Army on 30 June 1942 . After basic training at Camp Wolters , he was sent to Fort Meade for advanced infantry training . During basic training , he earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Component Bar and Expert Badge with Bayonet Component Bar .\nMediterranean Theater .\nMurphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943 . He was assigned to Company B , 1st Battalion , 15th Infantry Regiment , 3rd Infantry Division , which trained under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott . He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily . He was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July .\nWhen the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata , Sicily , on 10 July , Murphy was a division runner . On a scouting patrol , he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì . Sidelined with illness for a week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July , he rejoined them when they were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement , while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina .\nMurphy participated in the September 1943 mainland Salerno landing at Battipaglia . While on a scouting party along the Volturno River , he and two other soldiers were ambushed ; German machine gun fire killed one soldier . Murphy and the other survivor responded by killing five Germans with hand grenades and machine gun fire . While taking part in the October Allied assault on the Volturno Line , near Mignano Monte Lungo Hill 193 , he and his company repelled an attack by seven German soldiers , killing three and taking four prisoner . Murphy was promoted to sergeant on 13 December .\nIn January 1944 , Murphy was promoted to staff sergeant . He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January and was unable to participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead . He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna , and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle . He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio , where they remained four months . Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March , Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank . He then crawled out alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades , for which he received the Bronze Star with V device .\nMurphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria . Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B , 15th Infantry , including Murphy , were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May .\nMurphy was awarded a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star . American forces liberated Rome on 4 June , and Murphy remained bivouacked in Rome with his platoon throughout July .\nEuropean Theater .\nDuring the first wave of the Allied invasion of southern France , Murphy received the Distinguished Service Cross for action taken on 15 August 1944 .\nAfter landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle , Murphys platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers . He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers , killing two and wounding one . Two Germans exited a house about away and appeared to surrender ; when Murphys best friend responded , they shot and killed him . Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire . He killed six , wounded two and took 11 prisoner .\nMurphy was with the 1st Battalion , 15th Infantry Regiment during the 27–28 August offensive at Montélimar that secured the area from the Germans . Along with the other soldiers who took part in the action , he received the Presidential Unit Citation .\nMurphys first Purple Heart was for a heel wound received in a mortar shell blast on 15 September 1944 in northeastern France . His first Silver Star came after he killed four and wounded three at a German machine gun position on 2 October at LOmet quarry in the Cleurie river valley . Three days later , Murphy crawled alone towards the Germans at LOmet , carrying an SCR-536 radio and directing his men for an hour while the Germans fired directly at him . When his men finally took the hill , 15 Germans had been killed and 35 wounded . Murphys actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star . He was awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on 14 October , which elevated him to platoon leader . While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October , the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group . Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper ; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes . At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence , the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and kept him out of combat until January . Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury .\nThe Colmar Pocket , in the Vosges Mountains , had been held by German troops since November 1944 . On 14 January 1945 , Murphy rejoined his platoon , which had been moved to the Colmar area in December . He moved with the 3rd Division on 24 January to the town of Holtzwihr , where they faced a strong German counterattack . He was wounded in both legs , for which he received a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart . As the company awaited reinforcements on 26 January , he was made commander of Company B .\nThe Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer , setting it alight , forcing the crew to abandon it . Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods , remaining alone at his post , shooting his M1 carbine and directing artillery fire via his field radio while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position . Murphy mounted the abandoned , burning tank destroyer and began firing its .50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans , killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him . For an hour , Murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer returning German fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks , killing or wounding 50 Germans . He sustained a leg wound during his stand , and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition . Murphy rejoined his men , disregarding his own injury , and led them back to repel the Germans . He insisted on remaining with his men while his wounds were treated .\nFor his actions that day , he was awarded the Medal of Honor . The 3rd Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions at the Colmar Pocket , giving Murphy a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for the emblem .\nOn 16 February , Murphy was promoted to first lieutenant and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service from 22 January 1944 to 18 February 1945 . He was moved from the front lines to Regimental Headquarters and made a liaison officer .\nDecorations .\nThe United States additionally honored Murphys war contributions with the American Campaign Medal , the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with arrowhead device and 9 campaign stars , the World War II Victory Medal , and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp . France recognized his service with the French Legion of Honor – Grade of Chevalier , the French Croix de guerre with Silver Star , the French Croix de guerre with Palm , the French Liberation Medal and the French Fourragère in Colors of the Croix de guerre , which was authorized for all members of the 3rd Infantry Division who fought in France during World War II . Belgium awarded Murphy the Belgian Croix de guerre with 1940 Palm .\nBrigadier General Ralph B . Lovett and Lieutenant Colonel Hallet D . Edson recommended Murphy for the Medal of Honor . Near Salzburg , Austria on 2 June 1945 , Lieutenant General A.M . Patch presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit for his actions at Holtzwihr . When asked after the war why he had seized the machine gun and taken on an entire company of German infantry , he replied , They were killing my friends .\nMurphy received every U.S . military combat award for valor available from the U.S . Army for his World War II service .\nPostwar military service .\nInquiries were made through official channels about the prospect of Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States , but he never enrolled . According to author Don Graham , Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it , possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam .\nMurphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas , for temporary duty and reassignment . Upon arrival on 13 June , he was one of four assigned to Fort Sam Houston Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station and sent home for 30 days of recuperation , with permission to travel anywhere within the United States during that period . While on leave , Murphy was feted with parades , banquets , and speeches . He received a belated Good Conduct Medal on 21 August .\nHe was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers Reserve Corps .\nPost-traumatic stress .\nSince his military service , Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression , and he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow . A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches , vomiting , and nightmares about the war . His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares . During the mid-1960s , he recognized his dependence on the sedative Placidyl , and locked himself alone in a hotel room for a week to successfully break the addiction . Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness , and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming . His first wife , Dixie Wanda Hendrix , claimed he once held her at gunpoint . She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans . Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge . His poem The Crosses Grow on Anzio appeared in his book To Hell and Back , but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan .\nTo draw attention to the problems of returning Korean War and Vietnam War veterans , Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with posttraumatic stress disorder . It was known during Murphys lifetime as battle fatigue and shell shock , terminology that dated back to World War I . He called on the government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact of combat experiences , and to extend health care benefits to war veterans . As a result of legislation introduced by U.S . Congressman Olin Teague five months after Murphys death in 1971 , the Audie L . Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio , now a part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System , was dedicated in 1973 .\nTexas Army National Guard .\nAt the end of World War II , the 36th Infantry Division reverted to state control as part of the Texas Army National Guard , and Murphys friends , Major General H . Miller Ainsworth and Brigadier General Carl L . Phinney , were the 36ths commander and deputy commander respectively . After 25 June 1950 commencement of the Korean War , Murphy began a second military career and was commissioned as a captain in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard . He drilled new recruits in the summer training camps , and granted the Guard permission to use his name and image in recruiting materials . Although he wanted to join the fighting and juggled training activities with his film career , the 36th Infantry Division was never sent to Korea .\nAt his request , he transferred to inactive status on 1 October 1951 because of his film commitments with MGM Studios , and returned to active status in 1955 . Murphy was promoted to the rank of major by the Texas Army National Guard in 1956 and returned to inactive status in 1957 . In 1969 , his official separation from the Guard transferred him to the United States Army Reserve . He remained with the USAR until his transfer to the Retired Reserve in 1969 .\nFilm career .\nThroughout an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969 , Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one television series . When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of Life magazine depicting Murphy as the most decorated soldier , he brought him to Hollywood . Cagney and his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training in acting , voice and dance . They never cast Murphy in a movie and a personal disagreement ended the association in 1947 . Murphy later worked with acting coach Estelle Harman , and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan .\nMurphy moved into Terry Hunts Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948 . Hollywood writer David Spec McClure befriended Murphy , collaborating with him on Murphys 1949 book To Hell and Back . McClure used his connections to get a $500 ( ) bit part in Texas , Brooklyn & Heaven ( 1948 ) for Murphy . The agent of Wanda Hendrix , whom Murphy had been dating since 1946 , got him a bit part in the Alan Ladd film Beyond Glory directed by John Farrow earlier that same year . His 1949 film Bad Boy gave him his first leading role . The films financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead ; thus , Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor and gave him the starring role .\nUniversal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week ( ) . His first film for them was as Billy the Kid in The Kid from Texas in 1950 . He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring Wanda Hendrix , who by that time had become his wife , and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James . Universal lent him to MGM in 1951 at a salary of $25,000 to play the lead of The Youth in The Red Badge of Courage , directed by John Huston . Murphy and Huston worked together again in the 1960 film The Unforgiven .\nThe only film Murphy made in 1952 was The Duel at Silver Creek with director Don Siegel . Murphy worked with Siegel one more time in 1958 for The Gun Runners . In 1953 , he starred in Frederick de Cordovas Column South , and played Jim Harvey in Nathan Jurans Tumbleweed , an adaptation of the Kenneth Perkins novel Three Were Renegades . Director Nathan Juran also directed Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River . George Marshall directed Murphy in the 1954 Destry , a remake of Destry Rides Again , based on a character created by author Max Brand .\nAlthough Murphy was initially reluctant to appear as himself in To Hell and Back , the 1955 adaptation of his book directed by Jesse Hibbs , he eventually agreed ; it became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time . To help publicize the release of the film , he made guest appearances on television shows such as Whats My Line? , Toast of the Town , and Colgate Comedy Hour . The Hibbs-Murphy team proved so successful in To Hell and Back that the two worked together on five subsequent films . The partnership resulted in Murphy appearing as John Phillip Clum in the 1956 western Walk the Proud Land , and the non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner . They worked together for the last time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail .\nJoseph L . Mankiewicz hired Murphy to play the titular role in the 1958 film The Quiet American . Murphy formed a partnership with Harry Joe Brown to make three films , starting with The Guns of Fort Petticoat ( 1957 ) . The partnership fell into disagreement over the remaining two projects , and Brown filed suit against Murphy .\nIn 1957 Murphy was cast as The Utica Kid along with James Stewart and Dan Duryea in the western Night Passage .\nMurphy was featured in three westerns in 1959 : he starred opposite Sandra Dee in The Wild and the Innocent , collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch on the black and white Cast a Long Shadow , and performed as a hired killer in No Name on the Bullet , a film that was well received by critics . Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 Startime television episode The Man . During the early 1960s , Murphy donated his time and otherwise lent his name and image for three episodes of The Big Picture television series produced by the United States Army . He received the 1960 Outstanding Civilian Service Medal for his cooperation in the episode Broken Bridge , which featured his visits to military installations in Germany , Italy , Turkey and the U.S . state of New Mexico to showcase the militarys latest weaponry .\nWriter Clair Huffaker wrote the 1961 screenplays for Murphys films Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell . Willard W . Willingham and his wife Mary Willingham befriended Murphy in his early days in Hollywood and worked with him on a number of projects .\nWillard was a producer on Murphys 1961 television series Whispering Smith , and co-wrote the screenplay for Battle at Bloody Beach that year . He collaborated on Bullet for a Badman in 1964 and Arizona Raiders in 1965 . The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplay for Gunpoint as well as the script for Murphys last starring lead in the western 40 Guns to Apache Pass in 1967 . Murphy made Trunk to Cairo in Israel in 1966 .\nHe first met director Budd Boetticher when Murphy requested to be his boxing partner at Terry Hunts Athletic Club . He subsequently appeared in the 1951 title role of Boettichers first western The Cimarron Kid . Boetticher wrote the script in 1969 for Murphys last film , A Time for Dying . Two other projects that Murphy and Boetticher planned to collaborate on – A Horse for Mr Barnum and When Theres Sumpthin to Do – never came to fruition .\nPersonal life .\nMurphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949 . Their divorce became final two years later in 1951 . Four days later , he married former airline stewardess Pamela Opal Lee Archer ( 7 October 1919/1920/1923 – 8 April 2010 ) , with whom he had two sons : Terry Michael ( born 14 March 1952 ) , and James Shannon ( born 1954 ) .\nMurphy bred quarter horses at the Audie Murphy Ranch in what is now Menifee , California , and the Murphy Ranch in Pima County , Arizona .\nHis horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack , and he invested large sums of money in the hobby . Murphys gambling left his finances in a poor state . In 1968 , he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes . In spite of his financial difficulties , Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes , mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market .\nIn May 1970 , he was arrested in Burbank , California , charged with battery and assault with intent to commit murder in a dispute with a dog trainer . He was accused of firing a shot at the man , which he denied . Murphy was cleared of the charges .\nDeath and commemorations .\nOn 28 May 1971 , Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain , near Catawba , Virginia , west of Roanoke in conditions of rain , clouds , fog and zero visibility . The pilot and four other passengers were also killed .\nThe aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time , but who held no instrument rating . The aircraft was recovered on 31 May . After her husbands death , Pamela Murphy moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles , where she remained employed for 35 years .\nIn 1975 , a court awarded Murphys widow , Pamela , and their two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident .\nOn 7 June 1971 , Murphy was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery . In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N . George H . W . Bush , Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland , and many of the 3rd Infantry Division . Murphys gravesite is in Section 46 , headstone number 46-366-11 , located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater . A special flagstone walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects . It is the cemeterys second most-visited gravesite , after that of President John F . Kennedy .\nThe headstones of Medal of Honor recipients buried at Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf . Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous , like that of an ordinary soldier . The headstone contains the birth year 1924 , based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records . In 1974 , a large granite marker was erected just off the Appalachian Trail at at 3,100 elevation , near the crash site .\nCivilian honors were bestowed on Murphy during his lifetime and posthumously , including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . In 2013 , Murphy was honored by his home state with the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor .\nIn 2014 , the rock band Sabaton released a song titled To Hell and Back in reference to Audie Murphy and his film , on their album Heroes .\nSong writing .\nDavid McClure , his collaborator on the book To Hell and Back , discovered Murphys talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphys Hollywood apartment . One of those poems , The Crosses Grow on Anzio , appears in To Hell and Back attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan . Only two others survived , Alone and Far Removed and Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle . The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery , and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title Dusty Old Helmet .\nMurphy was a fan of country music , in particular Bob Wills and Chet Atkins , but was not a singer or musician himself . Through his friend Guy Mitchell , Murphy was introduced to songwriter Scott Turner in 1961 . The two collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970 , the most successful of which was Shutters and Boards and When the Wind Blows in Chicago .\nExternal links .\n- Image of Audie Murphy with unidentified man during screen test in Los Angeles , California , 1946 .

    "story": "Seán MacEntee\nSeán Francis MacEntee ( ; 23 August 1889 – 9 January 1984 ) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Tánaiste from 1959 to 1969 , Minister for Social Welfare from 1957 to 1961 , Minister for Health from 1957 to 1965 , Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1941 to 1948 , Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1939 to 1941 , Minister for Finance from 1932 to 1939 and 1951 to 1954 . He served as a Teachta Dála ( TD ) from 1918 to 1969 . At the time of his death , he was the last surviving member of the First Dáil .\nEarly life .\nBorn as John McEntee at 47 King Street , Belfast on 23 August 1889 , the son of James McEntee , a publican , and his wife , Mary Owens , both of whom were from Monaghan . In 1901 and 1911 , the familys address was 49 King Street . James McEntee was a prominent Nationalist member of Belfast Corporation and a close friend of Joe Devlin MP .\nMacEntee was educated at St Marys Christian Brothers School , St . Malachys College , the Belfast Municipal College of Technology and Queens University Belfast where he qualified as an electrical engineer . His early political involvement was with the Irish Socialist Republican Party in Belfast city . He quickly rose through the ranks of the trade union movement becoming junior representative in the citys shipyards . Following his education MacEntee worked as an engineer in Dundalk , County Louth , and was involved in the establishment of a local corps of the Irish Volunteers in the town . He mobilised in Dundalk and fought in the General Post Office Garrison in the Easter Rising in 1916 . He was sentenced to death for his part in the rising . This sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment . MacEntee was released in the general amnesty in 1917 , and was later elected a member of the National Executives of both Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in October 1917 . MacEntee was later elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Monaghan South at the 1918 general election .\nRebellion years .\nAn attempt to develop his career as a consulting engineer in Belfast was interrupted by the War of Independence in 1919 . MacEntee served as Vice-Commandant of the Belfast Brigade of the Irish Republican Army . He was also a member of the Volunteer Executive , a sort of Cabinet and Directory for the Minister for Defence and the HQ Staff But MacEntee remained one of the few Sinn Féiners from the north . On 6 August 1920 , MacEntee presented a Memorial lecture to the Dáil from the Belfast Corporation . He told the Dáil it was the only custodian of public order , and that a Nationalist pogrom was taking place , he advised them to fight Belfast . The Dáil governments policy was dubbedHibernia Irredenta or Greening Ireland . But many nationalist towns in Ulster wanted to remain British . Sean MacEntee was asked to resign his South Monaghan seat , after voting against a bunting celebration in Lurgan to mark the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty .\nPath to civil war .\nFrom April 1921 , when MacEntee was transferred to Dublin to direct a special anti-partition campaign in connection with the May general election . It remained Collins policy , he declared , that the largely Protestant shipyard workers of Belfast were being directed by the British , urging all Irishmen to rejoin the Republic . Correspondingly the Ulster Unionist Council rejected the call for a review of the boundary commission decision made on Northern Ireland . But when Ulstermen chose James Craig as Premier , Collins denounced democracy in the north as a sham . It was on the partition of Ireland issue that MacEntee voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 . During the subsequent Civil War MacEntee commanded the IRA unit in Marlboro Street Post Office in Dublin . He later fought with Cathal Brugha in the Hamman Hotel , and was subsequently interned in Kilmainham and Gormanstown until December 1923 .\nPolitician in the Free State .\nAfter his release from prison , MacEntee devoted himself more fully to his engineering practice , although he unsuccessfully contested Dublin County by-election of 1924 . He became a founder-member of Fianna Fáil in 1926 and was eventually elected a TD for Dublin County at the 1927 general election .\nMacEntee founded the Association of Patent Agents in 1929 , having gained his interest in Patents when he worked as an assistant engineer in Dundalk Urban District Council . On MacEntees appointment as Minister for Finance in 1932 , his colleague , Francis Litton who was acting as Secretary of the Association , circulated the members with a notice to the effect that the Association was suspended until such time as MacEntee could return as he now had to devote his energies to the affairs of the State . However , the other members decided to carry on . MacEntee must have valued his status as a Patent Agent since he maintained his name on the Register for over 30 years while he held Ministerial rank in the Irish Government , although he is not thought to have taken any active part in the patent business , which was carried on by his business partners .\nIn the first Fianna Fáil government ( 1932–48 ) .\nIn 1932 , Fianna Fáil came to power for the very first time , with MacEntee becoming Minister for Finance . In keeping with the partys protectionist economic policies his first budget in March of that year saw the introduction of new duties on forty-three imports , many of them coming from Britain . This saw retaliation from the British government , which in turn provoked a response from the Irish government . This was the beginning of the Economic War between the two nations , however , a treaty in 1938 , signed by MacEntee and other senior members who brought an end to the issue .\nIn 1939 , World War II broke out and a cabinet reshuffle resulted in MacEntee being appointed as Minister for Industry and Commerce , taking over from his rival Seán Lemass . During his tenure at this department MacEntee introduced the important Trade Union Act ( 1941 ) . In 1941 , another reshuffle of ministers took place , with MacEntee becoming Minister for Local Government and Public Health . The Health portfolio was transferred to a new Department of Health in 1947 . Following the 1948 general election , Fianna Fáil returned to the opposition benches for the first time in sixteen years .\nIn later Fianna Fáil governments ( 1951–54 , 1957–65 ) .\nIn 1951 , Fianna Fáil were back in government , although in minority status , depending on independent deputies for survival . MacEntee once again returned to the position of Minister for Finance where he felt it was vital to deal with the balance of payments deficit . He brought in a harsh budget in 1951 which raised income tax and tariffs on imports . His chief aim was to cut spending and reduce imports , however , this came at a cost as unemployment increased sharply . The increases were retained in his next two budgets in 1952 and 1953 . It is often said that it was MacEntees performance during this period that cost Fianna Fáil the general election in 1954 . The poor grasp on economics also did his political career tremendous damage as up to that point he was seen as a likely successor as Taoiseach . Now , however , Seán Lemass was firmly seen as the heir apparent .\nIn 1957 , Fianna Fáil returned to power with an overall majority with MacEntee being appointed Minister for Health . The financial and economic portfolios were dominated by Lemass and other like-minded ministers who wanted to move away from protection to free trade . He is credited during this period with the reorganisation of the health services , the establishment of separate departments of health and social welfare , and the fluoridation of water supplies in Ireland . In 1959 , MacEntee became Tánaiste when Seán Lemass was elected Taoiseach .\nRetirement and death .\nFollowing the 1965 general election , MacEntee was 76 years old and retired from the government . This did not mean that he went quietly to the backbenches . He re-emerged in 1966 to launch a verbal attack on Seán Lemass for deciding to step down as party leader and Taoiseach . The two men , however , patched up their differences shortly afterwards . MacEntee retired from Dáil Éireann in 1969 at the age of 80 , making him the oldest TD in Irish history .\nHe had a negative view of the Provisional IRA .\nMacEntee served in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and repeatedly proposed amendments that would have watered down resolutions against the Greek junta ( see Greek case ) .\nMacEntee died in Dublin on 9 January 1984 , at the age of 94 .\nFamily .\nIn June 1921 , he had married a strongly nationalistic woman from County Tipperary , Margaret Browne ( 1893–1976 ) , who later taught Irish at Alexandra College and then at UCD . Among Margarets brothers were Cardinal Michael Browne , poet and academic Monsignor Pádraig de Brún , and author Monsignor Maurice Browne . One of Seán and Margarets daughters is the Irish poet Máire Mhac an tSaoi . She was married to the politician Conor Cruise OBrien until his death . Their other daughter was Barbara MacEntee-Biggar ( 1928–1994 ) , who was married to Irish Ambassador Frank Biggar ( 1917–1974 ) ; Barbara and Franks eldest son is former Irish ambassador John Biggar ( 1952– ) . Seán and Margaret also had a son , Seamus MacEntee ( 1924–2000 ) , who lived mostly in England , working as a psychiatrist , as well as being an artist painting under the name Sagesson ( Sages son is an English translation of the name MacEntee , which is an anglicisation of the Irish Mac an tSaoi , meaning Son of the wise man ) .\nBibliographical sources .\n- Beaslai , Piaras , Michael Collins and the Making of a New Ireland 2 vols , ( Dublin 1926 )\n- Boyce , George D & Alan O Day ( eds. ) The Ulster Crisis 1885–1921 ( Basingstoke 2006 )\n- Coogan , Tim Pat , Michael Collins : A biography ( London 1990 )\n- Costello , Francis , Enduring the Most : The Life and Death of Terence MacSwiney ( Dingle 1995 )\n- Curran , Joseph , The Birth of the Irish Free State ( Tuscaloosa , Ala , USA 1980 )\n- Doherty , Gabriel & Dermot Keogh ( eds ) Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State ( Cork 1998 )\n- Farrell , Brian , Creation of the Dail ( Dublin 1994 )\n- Original from the University of Michigan .

    "story": "Reginald Maudling\nReginald Maudling ( 7 March 1917 – 14 February 1979 ) was a British politician who held several Cabinet posts , including Chancellor of the Exchequer . From 1955 until the late 1960s , he was spoken of as a prospective Conservative leader , and he was twice seriously considered for the post ; he was Edward Heaths chief rival in 1965 . He also held directorships in several British financial firms .\nAs Home Secretary , he was responsible for the UK Governments Northern Ireland policy during the period that included Bloody Sunday in 1972 . Soon afterwards , he left office due to an unrelated scandal in one of the companies of which he was director .\nEarly life .\nReginald Maudling was born in Woodside Park , North Finchley , and was named after his father , Reginald George Maudling , an actuary at R . Watson & Sons and Public Valuer , who contracted to do actuarial and financial calculations as the Commercial Calculating Company Ltd . The family moved to Bexhill to escape German air raids ; Maudling won scholarships to the Merchant Taylors School and Merton College , Oxford .\nHe stayed out of undergraduate politics at Oxford , and studied the works of Hegel ; he was to formulate his conclusions later as to the inseparability of economic and political freedom : the purpose of State control and the guiding principle of its application is the achievement of true freedom . He obtained a first class Greats degree .\nPolitical career .\nShortly after graduating , Maudling set up a meeting with Harold Nicolson to discuss whether it would be better , as a moderate conservative , to join the Conservative Party or National Labour ; Nicolson advised him to wait . Maudling was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1940 . However , he did not practise as a barrister , having volunteered for service in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in the Second World War .\nOwing to poor eyesight he took desk jobs in the RAF intelligence branch , where he rose—as a Wingless Wonder , as officers who were not qualified to wear pilots wings were nicknamed—to the rank of Flight Lieutenant ; he was then appointed Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air , Sir Archibald Sinclair .\nParliamentary candidate .\nMaudling wrote an essay on Conservative policy in November 1943 , recommending that the Conservatives neither imitate the Labour Party nor reflexively oppose all controls ; in the general election of July 1945 , he was selected as parliamentary candidate for Heston and Isleworth , a newly created constituency in Middlesex , although there were four applicants and he had no ties to that constituency . In the subsequent Labour landslide Maudling was defeated like many others , although Heston and Isleworth had been expected to be a safe Conservative seat . After its defeat in the 1945 general election , the Conservative Party engaged in an extensive rethink of its policy . Maudling argued that the Party had depended excessively on outdated economic slogans and the popularity of Winston Churchill .\nIn November 1945 , Maudling became the first staff member of the Conservative Parliamentary Secretariat , later the Conservative Research Department , where he was head of the Economic Section . He persuaded the party to accept much of the Labour governments nationalisation programme and social services while cutting government spending . In March 1946 , Maudling was chosen as the prospective candidate for Barnet , close to his birthplace in Finchley , and began giving speeches there . Labour had unexpectedly won the seat in 1945 , but it was considered to be marginal . In 1950 , Maudling was elected as Member of Parliament with an absolute majority .\nMember of Parliament and Cabinet .\nFollowing the 1951 election , Churchill made Maudling a junior Minister at the Ministry of Civil Aviation . However , his experience of preparing economic policy led to his speaking on behalf of the Treasury on the 1952 budget and thus to an appointment , later that year , as Economic Secretary to the Treasury . With his mentor Rab Butler as Chancellor of the Exchequer , Maudling worked to reduce taxes and controls in order to move from post-war austerity to affluence . When Anthony Eden took over as Prime Minister in 1955 , Maudling was promoted to head a department as Minister of Supply . He supported the invasion of Suez .\nThe Ministry was responsible for aircraft production and supplying the armed forces , and Maudling came to agree with critics who argued that it was an unnecessary intermediary ; he therefore recommended its abolition . Although supportive of Harold Macmillans appointment as Prime Minister over the rival claims of Butler in 1957 , Maudling found himself in difficulties over his position in the new government . He refused to continue at the Ministry of Supply and also rejected an offer of the Ministry of Health because Iain Macleod , with whom he had a rivalry , had held the post five years earlier and Maudling did not want to be seen as five years behind him .\nMacmillan appointed Maudling to the post of Paymaster General and spokesman in the House of Commons for the Ministry of Fuel and Power , which was technically a demotion . Nine months later , Maudling had proved his usefulness ; Macmillan brought him into the Cabinet on 17 September 1957 , where he acted more as a Minister without Portfolio : he had specific responsibility for persuading the six members of the embryonic European Economic Community , who had recently signed the Treaty of Rome , to abandon their proposal for a customs union in favour of a wider free-trade area where each country would preserve their own external tariffs . However , Maudlings lack of international experience led him to underestimate the importance of the nascent Community and what was constructive in it . Faced with widespread rejection of the proposals , Maudling aroused hostility in Bonn and Paris by seeking to play off the Germans against the French .\nOn 14 November 1958 , six months after the election of General de Gaulle as premier , Jacques Soustelle , the French Minister of Information , confirmed to the Press that France would reject the Maudling plan . Two days later , the British delegation to the Community formally called an end to accession negotiations . Maudling later revised his proposals , which were to form the basis of the European Free Trade Association .\nMeanwhile , Maudling became an underwriting member of Lloyds of London in December 1957 , although his assets were somewhat below average for other names .\nPresident of the Board of Trade .\nMaudling entered the front line of politics after the 1959 election when appointed President of the Board of Trade . He was responsible for introducing the governments proposals to help areas of high unemployment . This was achieved by paying grants to companies to create new plants in these deprived areas , and also by the government taking over unused land for development . Maudling also succeeded in negotiating a free trade agreement between the countries outside the Common Market ; this became the European Free Trade Association and was some compensation for his failure to negotiate a free trade area with the Common Market . Maudling was opposed to any proposal to join the Common Market on the basis that it would end Britains right to make commercial agreements with New Zealand and Australia . He was later to remark that I can think of no more retrograde step economically or politically . This comment was to be quoted against him when , less than two years later , he was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the reopening of negotiations for Common Market membership .\nColonial Secretary .\nReginald Maudling was for a short time , as Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1961 , responsible for the process of decolonisation . In this position he chaired constitutional conferences for Jamaica , Northern Rhodesia and Trinidad and Tobago which prepared them for independence ; his plan for Northern Rhodesia was controversial and he had to threaten resignation before it was approved . However , Maudling was keen to return to economic policy , and seized his opportunity when Macmillan made it clear in private that he supported a voluntary incomes policy . Maudling promptly made his case in public , and three weeks later was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in Macmillans Night of the Long Knives attempt to rejuvenate his Cabinet .\nChancellor of the Exchequer .\nAs Chancellor , Maudling soon cut purchase tax and bank interest rates . His 1963 budget aimed at expansion without inflation . Following a period of economic difficulty , with a growth target of 4% , Maudling was able to remove income tax from owner-occupiers residential premises . He also abolished the rate of duty on home-brewed beer which in effect legalised it . This was the period in which Maudling was at his most popular within the Conservative Party and in the country .\nHowever , later commentators have been less kind to Maudling : Harold Wilson and his Chancellor James Callaghan ( who nevertheless sounded out Maudling for the governorship of the Bank of England in 1966 ) blamed the dash for growth that followed the 1963 budget for increasing sterlings chronic instability between 1964 and 1967 and by greatly increasing domestic demand the budget certainly exacerbated the existing balance of payments problem . Maudling largely recognised this himself by the time of the 1964 budget and , although he increased taxes , he did little to subdue demand in an election year .\nFirst unsuccessful leadership bid .\nBy 1963 , during the Profumo affair , there was talk , encouraged by Martin Redmayne ( Chief Whip ) and Lord Poole ( Party Chairman ) , of Maudling succeeding Macmillan as Prime Minister . Maudling visited Butler ( Deputy Prime Minister ) and obtained a mutual promise that they would , if necessary , agree to serve under one another – Maudling believed that he had gained an advantage in obtaining the agreement of Butler , his senior , to serve under him if necessary . However , William Rees-Mogg claimed in The Times on 28 July that Butler led Maudling by 2:1 in the Cabinet , although Maudling had more support amongst backbench MPs .\nHowever , Macmillans sudden illness and announcement of his resignation in October 1963 came at a time when Maudlings support had fallen . He was also poorly received at the Conservative Party conference , which had become a hustings for the leadership , despite coaching from Iain Macleod in how to deliver his speech . Back in London the following week , a process of consultation by Lord Chancellor Dilhorne and by Redmayne declared Foreign Secretary Lord Home , rather than Maudling or Butler , to be the compromise candidate . Enoch Powell , Macleod , Hailsham and Maudling ( known as the Quad in some accounts of the following days ) sought to persuade Butler to refuse to serve , so that Butler rather than Home would have to become Prime Minister . Macleod and Maudling demanded that Dilhorne lay the results of his consultations before the Cabinet , but he refused to do so . Maudling attended the meeting at Powells house late in the evening of 17 October , well-refreshed after attending a formal dinner , and seems to have gone along with it rather than being a ringleader , although he and Hailsham agreed to serve under Butler . However , on the morning of Saturday 19 October Butler then Maudling agreed to serve under Home , enabling him to accept office as Prime Minister .\nMaudling retained his post as Chancellor under the new Prime Minister , and , in the 1964 election , Maudling had a prominent role at the helm of the partys daily press conferences while Douglas-Home toured the country . On the BBCs election results programme , the journalist Anthony Howard said that he believed that if Maudling had been leader , the narrow Conservative defeat would have been a narrow Conservative victory . Upon being forced out of the post by the election defeat , Maudling left a note to his successor , James Callaghan , simply stating Good luck , old cock.. . Sorry to leave it in such a mess .\nSecond unsuccessful leadership bid .\nOut of office , Maudling accepted the offer of a seat on the board of Kleinwort Benson in November 1964 , one of the factors which led to his being shifted to spokesman on Foreign Affairs in early 1965 . Unlike other potential leadership contenders , Maudling publicly maintained his loyalty to Douglas-Home as criticisms of his leadership mounted . When Douglas-Home resigned , after putting in place a system in which the leadership was directly elected , Maudling fought against Edward Heath for the position of candidate to the party centre-right . Unfortunately for Maudling , Enoch Powell also stood , but he was a candidate supporting monetarist and proto-Thatcherite economics , which at that time had little support . Powell won 15 votes . Maudling won 133 votes against Heaths 150 ; Powells 15 votes were seen as more likely to have gone to Maudling had Powell not stood , but they would have made no difference to Heaths narrow majority . This was a moment of philosophical instability for the Conservatives . Their historic scepticism of Keynesianism began to grow through the 1960s because there was little to distinguish between the policies of the Tories and Labour . The cross-party support for economic planning and union negotiation was becoming increasingly unable to stimulate high levels of economic growth .\nMaudlings business directorships with Kleinwort Benson and others were mentioned by his opponents as evidence of his lack of commitment for the role , and he was criticised as too close to the Macmillan/Douglas-Home style of politics .\nDeputy Leader and Home Secretary .\nMaudling served as Deputy Leader under Heath , and was also a prominent member of the Shadow Cabinet . However , he was neither personally nor politically close to Heath , and as a consequence his influence declined ; his support for an incomes policy now went against party policy . He also tended to make gaffes , as for example when he said Harold Wilson had been following the same policy as the Conservatives on Rhodesia and I cant think of anything he has done wrongly . After Enoch Powell had been sacked from the Shadow Cabinet in 1968 for his controversial Rivers of Blood speech , Maudling was moved from the position of Shadow Commonwealth Secretary to become Shadow Defence Secretary until 1969 when he was replaced by Geoffrey Rippon . When the Conservatives returned to power in 1970 , Maudling was appointed Home Secretary ; the most pressing problem at the Home Office was tackling the Troubles in Northern Ireland . After boarding the aircraft at the end of his first visit to the province , he remarked For Gods sake bring me a large Scotch . What a bloody awful country .\nMaudlings attitude of reassuring calmness in interviews , normally helpful to him , was damaging when he referred to reducing IRA violence to an acceptable level , a remark widely regarded as a gaffe . He also tended to trust the Unionist-controlled Government of Northern Ireland and gloss over differences between their approach and that of the United Kingdom government . This backfired when the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland , James Chichester-Clark , resigned when denied the full number of troops he requested in March 1971 . That August , Maudling authorised the Northern Ireland government to introduce internment without trial for terror suspects , which caused widespread upheaval and anger among the nationalist population due to its exclusive use on that community , and was followed by an already planned massive escalation in the level of violence .\nRegarding criminal justice , Maudling made no attempt , despite his personal support , to reintroduce capital punishment after its abolition in 1969 . He introduced Community Service , a new alternative to prison , and in 1971 modestly tightened the immigration rules . He was criticised for ordering the deportation of Rudi Dutschke , later one of the founders of the German Green Party . Dutschke , who was in Britain to recuperate from an assassination attempt , was considered a student anarchist .\nMaudling was often the target of satirical cartoons in major newspapers , and was lampooned in the magazine Private Eye and the television comedy show Monty Pythons Flying Circus .\nBloody Sunday .\nMaudlings statement in the House of Commons after Bloody Sunday agreed with the British armys statement that the Parachute Regiment had fired only in self-defence , although this turned out to be untrue . Bernadette Devlin , a Northern Ireland nationalist MP , had been present in Derry at the protest , yet she was denied recognition to speak on the massacre by the Speaker of the House Selwyn Lloyd . Devlin walked across the floor of the Commons and slapped Maudling . She later said to journalists that Maudlings statement had been untrue and perfunctory , and that it had expressed no regrets for the 13 people shot and killed by British soldiers . Eventually , Edward Heath decided to bring in direct rule of Northern Ireland under a separate Secretary of State . In 1974 , Shane Paul ODoherty , a PIRA member , sent Maudling a letter bomb , which slightly injured him .\nScandal .\nIn 1972 , Maudlings business activities were causing considerable disquiet and speculation in the press . In 1966 , he had obtained a directorship in the company of John Poulson , an architect Maudling helped obtain lucrative contracts . Poulson routinely did business through bribery and in 1972 was made bankrupt . The bankruptcy hearings disclosed his bribe payments , and Maudlings connection became public knowledge . Maudling came to the decision that his responsibility for the Metropolitan Police , which was beginning fraud investigations into Poulson , made his position as Home Secretary untenable . He resigned on 18 July , to general sympathy from the press .\nShortly after receiving Maudlings resignation , Edward Heaths government performed a U-turn on economic policy and subsequently adopted an approach strikingly similar to Maudlings . Heath advised Maudling not to drop out of the public eye and he continued to make many media appearances . In the year after the Conservative Partys electoral defeat in 1974 , Heath was replaced as leader by Margaret Thatcher . She appointed Maudling to the post of Shadow Foreign Secretary . However , Maudling clashed with Thatcher over economics , and after less than two years in the role he was dismissed on 19 November 1976 . Departing , Maudling summed up his career as hired by Winston Churchill , fired by Margaret Thatcher .\nLast years .\nIn 1969 , Maudling had been president of the Real Estate Fund of America , whose chief executive , Jerome Hoffman , had been imprisoned for fraud ; Maudling had also been an adviser to the Peachey Property Corporation , whose chairman , Sir Eric Miller , had embezzled company money and later took his own life . He was revealed to have lobbied for more aid to Malta after obtaining a commission for Poulson there , which had led to heavy losses for the Maltese government . These further revelations led to a Parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of Maudling and two other MPs linked to Poulson . This inquiry published its report on 14 July 1977 ; the report concluded that Maudling had indulged in conduct inconsistent with the standards which the House is entitled to expect from its members .\nWhen the report was considered by the House of Commons , the Conservative Party organised its MPs to attend the debate to Save Reggie . An amendment was put down to take note of the report , instead of endorsing it , and carried by 230 votes ( 211 Conservatives , 17 Labour , 2 Liberals and 2 Ulster Unionists ) to 207 . No punishment was imposed . An attempt by backbench Labour MPs to expel Maudling from the House was defeated by 331 votes to 11 , and a move to suspend him for six months was lost by 324 to 97 .\nAs Lewis Bastons 2004 biography recounts , Maudling and his wife became heavy drinkers once his political career was effectively ended by the scandal . The drinking turned to alcoholism and Maudlings health rapidly deteriorated in the late 1970s . He collapsed in early 1979 .\nDeath .\nMaudling died at the Royal Free Hospital in London , from kidney failure and cirrhosis of the liver , on 14 February 1979 ; he was 61 . His body was buried in the churchyard of Little Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire . A stone seat from his garden was placed beside the grave .\nFamily life .\nMaudling married actress Beryl Laverick ( 1919–1988 ) in 1939 . They had three sons and a daughter , Caroline Maudling , who became a journalist in the 1960s as the travelling teenager of the Daily Mail and , among other things , appeared alongside John Lennon on BBC TVs Juke Box Jury in 1963 .\nMaudlings mother had disowned him as a result of his marriage , and Maudling did not attend her funeral in 1956 . When Caroline aroused comment by having a child out of wedlock in the late 1960s , Maudling was staunch in her defence , publicly expressing paternal pride . Beryl Maudlings body was buried next to her husbands at Little Berkhamsted .\nIn popular culture .\nMaudling was portrayed by Irish actor Michael Culkin in the BBC-produced 2018 limited television series A Very English Scandal .",

    "story": "Brian Taylor ( footballer , born 1937 )\nBrian Joseph Taylor ( 24 March 1937 – 10 June 2015 ) was an English footballer who played as a winger . In a career spanning over sixteen years he made 316 league appearances in the Football League .\nHe turned professional with Walsall in September 1954 , before winning a £10,000 move to Birmingham City in June 1958 . He played in the top flight , as well as in Europe , for the Blues , before he was struck down with a broken leg . He moved down a division to join Rotherham United in October 1961 , before dropping down another division to play for Shrewsbury Town two years later . His descent to the basement division was complete when he was signed by Port Vale for £3,000 in July 1965 . He transferred to Barnsley in May 1967 , and helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1967–68 . He later played non-league football with Kidderminster Harriers , Bromsgrove Rovers , Welshpool Town , Oswestry Town and Darlaston .\nPlaying career .\nTaylor started his career as an amateur with Walsall , and turned professional in September 1954 . He made more than 70 appearances for the Saddlers in the Third Division South . Frank Buckley failed to keep Walsall out of the re-election zone in the 1954–55 season , and the Fellows Park outfit continued to struggle in the lower half of the table in 1955–56 and 1956–57 under the stewardship of John Love . Despite the introduction of new boss Bill Moore , a 20th-place finish in 1957–58 left the club to become founder members of the Fourth Division .\nHe moved to First Division club Birmingham City in June 1958 in exchange for £10,000 and the inside-forward Jimmy Cochrane . Manager Arthur Turner described him as a wonderful prospect . He scored six goals from 30 appearances in the 1958–59 season . Each of the six was the last goal of its match : his first top-flight goal , tearing through straight from the second-half kick-off , helped earn his club a draw at Portsmouth , the other five all came in comfortable wins . Having come into the first team early in the 1959–60 season when Gordon Astall was injured in the home defeat of Newcastle United , Taylor suffered double vision in the reverse fixture a week later and was out for a month . He was selected regularly during October by manager Pat Beasley until a broken leg , sustained in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-final win over Union Saint-Gilloise in mid-November , kept him out for a year . Though he returned to the first team , the injury had robbed him of much of his pace . He scored on his return , against Manchester United , and made 24 appearances during the remainder of the season , sharing the outside-left position with Billy Rudd : Taylor was preferred on a heavy pitch .\nAfter the removal of the maximum wage in 1961 , Taylor was unable to agree terms for the coming season , so Birmingham circulated other clubs inviting offers for him . By mid-September , it became clear that the remaining few contract rebels , Taylor included , would get no help from the League in settling their disputes with their clubs , and the Professional Footballers Association advised them to submit transfer requests . Taylor played four first-team matches during September , then signed for Rotherham United on 13 October for a £10,000 fee .\nRotherham were competing in the Second Division under the stewardship of Tom Johnston . Taylor quickly became an established member of the team at Millmoor with his good crossing ability , making a total of 26 appearances in the 1961–62 season . In the following season he was in and out of the team under new boss Danny Williams , but still managed another 20 appearances for the Millers .\nHe moved to Shrewsbury Town for the 1963–64 season . Arthur Rowleys Shrews posted 11th and 16th-place finishes in the Third Division in 1963–64 and 1964–65 . Taylor played 73 league games in his two seasons at the Gay Meadow .\nTaylor was sold to Jackie Mudies Port Vale for £3,000 in July 1965 . He scored three goals in 42 appearances in the 1965–66 campaign , but made just 11 appearances at Vale Park in the 1966–67 season . He was given a free transfer to Fourth Division rivals Barnsley in May 1967 .\nTaylor played 24 games , and helped Johnny Steeles Tykes to win promotion with a second-place finish in 1967–68 , five points behind champions Luton Town . Despite this success , he left Oakwell and entered non-league football with Kidderminster Harriers ( West Midlands ( Regional ) League ) , Bromsgrove Rovers , Welshpool Town , Oswestry Town and Darlaston .\nLater life .\nTaylor died suddenly when on holiday in Menorca on 10 June 2015 . His wife Joan had predeceased him and he was survived by one son .

    "story": "Diego Columbus\nDiego Columbus ( ; ; ; 1479/1480 – February 23 , 1526 ) was a navigator and explorer under the Kings of Castile and Aragón . He served as the 2nd Admiral of the Indies , 2nd Viceroy of the Indies and 4th Governor of the Indies as a vassal to the Kings of Castile and Aragón . He was the elder son of Christopher Columbus and his wife Filipa Moniz Perestrelo .\nHe was born in Portugal , either in Porto Santo in 1479/1480 , or in Lisbon in 1474 . He spent most of his adult life trying to regain the titles and privileges granted to his father for his explorations and then denied him in 1500 . He was greatly aided in this goal by his marriage to María de Toledo y Rojas , niece of the 2nd Duke of Alba , who was the cousin of King Ferdinand .\nLife .\nDiego was made a page at the Spanish court in 1492 , the year his father embarked on his first voyage . Diego had a younger half-brother , Fernando , by Beatriz Enríquez de Arana .\nFerdinand and Diego had been pages to Prince Don Juan , then became pages to Queen Isabella in 1497 .\nIn August 1508 , he was named Governor of the Indies , the post his father had held , arriving to Santo Domingo in July 1509 . He established his home ( Alcázar de Colón ) , which still stands there , in Santo Domingo in what is now the Dominican Republic .\nAccording to Floyd , Diego ...was accompanied by a splendid entourage : his wife , Doña Maria , the first gran dama of the New World , the Duke of Albas niece , with her own suite of doncellas ; and his immediate relatives - Fernando his half-brother , his two uncles , Diego and Bartolomé , and his cousins , Andrea and Giovanni . Also on the expedition were his criados and his fathers old retainers : Marcos de Aguilar , his forthright alcalde mayor , Diego Mendez , his business manager , and Gerónimo de Agüero , his former tutor . Other loyal Colombistas met him at Santo Domingo - his uncle by marriage , Francisco de Garay , whom he named alguacil mayor , and Bartolomés criados , Miguel Díaz , Diego Velázquez , and Juan Cerón . His coming represented the permanent establishment of the most titled and notable family in the islands , at least for many years .\nIn 1511 , a royal council declared Hispaniola , Puerto Rico , Jamaica and Cuba were under Diegos power by right of his fathers discovery . However , Uraba and Veragua were deemed excluded , since the council regarded them as being discovered by Rodrigo de Bastidas . The council further confirmed Diegos titles of Viceroy and admiral were hereditary , though honorific . Furthermore , Diego had the right to one-tenth of the net royal income . However , factions soon formed between those loyal to Diego and Ferdinands royal officials . Matters deteriorated to the point that Ferdinand recalled Diego in 1514 . Diego then spent the next five years in Spain futilely pressing his claims . Finally , in 1520 , Diegos powers were restored by Charles .\nDiego returned to Santo Domingo on 12 Nov . 1520 in the midst of a native revolt in the area of the Franciscan missions on the Cumana River . This was also the area of the Spanish salt and pearl trade , besides slave hunting . Diego sent Gonzalo de Ocampo on a punitive expedition with 200 men and 6 ships . Then in 1521 , Diego invested in Bartolomé de las Casas enterprise to settle the Cumana area . That failure , blamed on Diego , meant the loss of the kings confidence . That loss , plus Diegos defiance of royal power on Cuba , forced Charles to reprimand Diego in 1523 and recall him back to Spain .\nAfter his death , a compromise was reached in 1536 in which his son , Luis Colón de Toledo , was named Admiral of the Indies and renounced all other rights for a perpetual annuity of 10,000 ducats , the island of Jamaica as a fief , an estate of 25 square leagues on the Isthmus of Panama , then called Veragua , and the titles of Duke of Veragua and Marquess of Jamaica .\nThe first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522 , when enslaved Muslims of the Wolof nation led an uprising in the sugar plantation of admiral Don Diego Colon . Many of these insurgents managed to escape to the mountains where they formed independent maroon communities among the Tainos .\nAfter Columbuss death on February 23 , 1526 , in Spain , the rents , offices and titles in the New World went into dispute by his descendants .\nMarriage and children .\nHe initially planned to marry Mencia de Guzman , daughter of the Duke of Medina Sidonia. , but he was forced by King Fernando to marry the kings cousin María de Toledo y Rojas ( c . 1490 – May 11 , 1549 ) , who secured the transportation and burial of her father-in-law , Christopher Columbus , in Santo Domingo . She was the daughter of Fernando Alvarez de Toledo , 1st Lord of Villoria , son of García Álvarez de Toledo , 1st Duke of Alba , and his first wife María de Rojas , and had the following children :\n- María Colón de Toledo ( c . 1510 – ) , married to Sancho Folch de Cardona , 1st Marquess of Guadalest\n- Luis Colón , 1st Duke of Veragua\n- Cristóbal Colón de Toledo ( c . 1510 – 1571 ) , married firstly to María Leonor Lerma de Zuazo , without issue ; married secondly to Ana de Pravia , and had one son ( Diego Colon y Pravia [ c . 1551 - Jan 27 , 1578 ] ) and one daughter ( Francisca Colon y Pravia , [ c . 1552 - April 1616 ] ; and married thirdly to María Magadalena de Guzmán y Anaya , and had :\n- Diego Colón de Toledo , father of Diego the 4th Admiral of the Indies .\n- Francisca Colón de Toledo y Pravia ( c . 1550 – April , 1616 ) , married Diego de Ortegón ( c . 1550 – ) , and had four children : Guiomar de Ortegon y Colon [ d . 1621 ] ; Jacoba de Oretgon y Colon [ d . 1618 ] ; Ana de Ortegon y Colon ; and Josefa de Ortegon y Colon\n- María Colón de Toledo y Guzmán ( c . 1550 – ) , married to Luis de Avila , and had :\n- Cristóbal de Avila y Colón ( 1579 – ) , unmarried and without issue\n- Luis de Avila y Colón ( 1582-1633 ) , married Maria de Rojas-Guzman Grajeda , without issue ; married secondly to Francisca de Sandoval and had one son Cristobal\n- Juan Colón Dávila ( -1622 ) , married Leonor Luyando y Manuel and had three sons .\n- Bernardino Dávila y Colón ( -1633 )\n- Maria de Avila y Colón ( 1592- ) , married Alonso de Guzman Grajeda and had one daughter ( Mayor de Grajeda y Avila [ c.1611- ] )\n- Magdalena Dávila Colón ( 1592-1621 )\n- María Dávila Colón ( 1596- )\n- Juana Colón de Toledo ( died c . 1592 ) , married her cousin Luis de La Cueva y Toledo ; their only child was María Colón de la Cueva ( c . 1548-c.1600 ) who claimed the duchy of Veragua and died in New Spain ( México ) .\n- Isabel Colón de Toledo ( c . 1515 – ) , married Dom Jorge Alberto de Portugal y Melo ( 1470 – ) , 1st Count of Gelves ( who married secondly ; his 1st marriage to Dona Guiomar de Ataíde remained childless ) , son of Dom Álvaro de Bragança , Lord of Tentúgal , Póvoa , Buarcos and Cadaval and Chancellor-Major of the Realm of Portugal .

A low-wing monoplane , Tingmissartoq was outfitted with Edo floats , as much of the planned route was over water .\nThe trip was described solely as a vacation flight , with no start or finish , no diplomatic or commercial significance , and no records to be sought . It began in North Haven , Maine , from which point the couple flew to Ottawa . From there they flew to various other sites in Canada , including Moose Factory , Churchill , Baker Lake , and Aklavik , before heading to Point Barrow , Alaska . They continued on to Shismaref and Nome , after which they crossed the Pacific Ocean to Petropavlosk . From here they continued over the Kuril Islands to Tokyo , where they were enthusiastically welcomed . The trip continued on to China , with its final stop on Lotus Lake near Nanking made on September 19 .\nAnne Morrow Lindbergh described the trip , and her impressions and experiences , in her book North to the Orient .\nAccident at Hankow .\nWhile at Hankow , the plane , with the Lindberghs aboard , was being lowered into the Yangtze River from the British aircraft carrier when it capsized accidentally . One wing hit a ships cable and was damaged , necessitating the crafts return to the United States for repairs .\nSecond journey .\nTingmissartoq was to see action again in 1933 as a result of international interest in the development of commercial air transport . Pan American Airways , Imperial Airways , Deutsche Luft Hansa , KLM , and Air France collaborated on a study of international air routes . The assigned areas were Newfoundland to Europe via Greenland ; Newfoundland via the great circle route to Ireland ; Newfoundland southeast to the Azores and Lisbon ; Miami , Bermuda , the Azores , and Lisbon ; and across the South Atlantic from Brazil , to Cape Verde . Pan American was given the responsibility for the first of these , and sent Lindbergh , as the companys technical advisor , to survey the route . Accompanied once more by Anne , he took off from New York City on July 9 in the rebuilt craft . The purpose of the trip was to gain as much data as possible on the area to be covered .\nThe plane had been fitted with a Sperry artificial horizon and a directional gyro since its previous flight . The engine , too , was new , a Wright Cyclone SR1820-F2 of 710 hp . All possible spaces were used , including the wings and floats ; these contained the gasoline tanks . There was also plenty of emergency equipment for use in the event of a forced landing .\nTo maintain radio contact with the couple , Pan American hired a Danish ship , the Jellinge , to stay within range in the area of Labrador , Greenland , and Iceland . It also delivered advance supplies for them to Halifax , St . Johns , Cartwright , Greenland , and Iceland .\nTingmissartoq flew first from New York to Hopedale , Labrador , hugging the eastern Canada–US border along the way . From here the Lindberghs made the first major hop over water , flying 650 miles to Godthaab . The couple then crisscrossed Greenland to Baffin Island and back , and then flew to Iceland . They continued the trip by flying around the world ; visiting first the major cities of Europe , they continued to Moscow , then down Africas west coast , and across the South Atlantic to South America . Here , they flew down the Amazon River , and then turned north through Trinidad and Barbados before returning to the United States . They returned to New York on December 19 , having traveled 30,000 miles and visited four continents and twenty-one countries . The information they provided proved invaluable in planning transatlantic air transport routes .\nTingmissartoq was on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City until 1955 , when it was acquired by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton , Ohio . It was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 , and is currently on display in the Pioneers of Flight gallery of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC .\nReferences .\n- History at NASM website",

    "story": "British Rail Class 315\nThe British Rail Class 315 alternating current ( AC ) electric multiple units ( EMU ) are National Rail units currently in operation on suburban lines in London . They were built by British Rail Engineering Limited at Holgate Road carriage works from 1980 to 1981 , and they were the fifth and final variant of British Rails then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs , which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes ( Class 313/314/315/507/508 ) . They operate on the 25 kV overhead line and work inner-suburban Transport for London-run services on the Shenfield Metro for TfL Rail , on weekdays only .\nDescription .\nEach complete Class 315 unit is formed of four vehicles with them running for the majority in an 8 car formation with 12 car formations being common if demand is high or the route they are taking is long , such as ones to Southend Victoria or Southminster ( operated by Greater Anglia ) .\nThe vehicles include : Driving Motor Standard Open ( DMSO ) , Pantograph Trailer Standard Open ( PTSO ) , Trailer Standard Open ( TSO ) , and Driving Motor Standard Open ( DMSO ) . Each DMSO carries four traction motors ( 315801-841 originally had Brush TM61-53 and 315842-861 had GEC G310AZ , but these motors are interchangeable and nowadays any type can be found on any unit ) rated at each and a main compressor and air reservoir which carries air for the brakes and suspension . The original pneumatic door system has been replaced by an all-electric door system . The PTSO carries the main and auxiliary transformers , batteries and battery charger , Stone Faiveley AMBR Mk.1 pantograph , vacuum circuit breaker and auxiliary compressor . The TSO carries no equipment other than that which is standard to all coaches .\nThe coaches only contain standard seating and have no toilet facilities . Car numbering is as follows :\n- 64461-64582 - DMSO\n- 71281-71341 - PTSO\n- 71389-71449 - TSO\nEach four-car set is able to seat 318 passengers . The Class 315 units replaced the Class 306 units .\nOperations .\nHistorical services .\nFollowing the privatisation of British Rail , the Class 315s were divided between First Great Eastern ( 43 units ) and West Anglia Great Northern ( 18 units ) . The leasing company Eversholt Rail Group has owned the entire Class 315 fleet since privatisation .\nFrom April 2004 , National Express East Anglia ( NXEA ) ran the inaugural Greater Anglia franchise , which combined the previous operations of both First Great Eastern and West Anglia Great Northern , meaning the two Class 315 fleets were combined . The franchise was initially known as One but was rebranded National Express East Anglia ( NXEA ) in February 2008 .\nA refurbishment programme commenced from mid-2004 , when National Express East Anglia ( then One railway ) contracted Bombardier to carry out the refurbishment of all 61 units , starting with the ex-First Great Eastern examples . The low-back 3+2 seating is retained , so the capacity stays the same .\nThe Class 315 fleet transferred to new operator Abellio Greater Anglia in February 2012 . Abellio repainted the trains in its own livery , and undertook a refresh of the fleet , including a Passenger Information System and a flexible space for wheelchairs and cycles which includes tip-up seating and call to aid buttons . Abellio used the fleet for local services out of to ( the popular Shenfield Metro service ) on the Great Eastern Main Line and , and on the Lea Valley Lines . They were also seen on the Romford–Upminster line between and , a duty shared with Class 317s .\nHowever , until the end of operation by Abellio Greater Anglia , a number of them were found running further afield , running on the Great Eastern and West Anglia Main Lines at peak times only to Bishops Stortford , Broxbourne , Southminster and Southend Victoria .\nInitially , the Shenfield Metro and Upminster Branch Line services used only units 315801-843 and the Lea Valley Lines only 315844-861 , reflecting the allocations of the former franchises .\nAll 61 units were then used interchangeably , operating out of Ilford EMU Depot .\nCurrent services .\nThe current operator of the fleet is TfL Rail , who operate the units on Shenfield metro services on weekdays only .\nMost of the withdrawn Class 315s were scrapped , but some TfL Rail Class 315s were temporarily moved to London Overground as a temporary measure and were in operation until the Class 710 was fully introduced .\nReplacement .\nIn July 2015 , TfL confirmed that it would place a £260m order for 45 units Class 710 Aventra trains , which would replace London Overground Class 315 . The Class 710 Aventra would be introduced on the West Anglia Routes , taken over from Abellio Greater Anglia in May 2015 , in 2018 . The first units on the Lea Valley lines entered service on 3 March 2020 after a first attempt on 24 February 2020 .\nAdditionally , TfL Rail Class 315s were replaced by new Class 345 Aventra trains from August 2017 . On 20 October 2018 , the first retired unit , 315850 , was hauled to C F Booth of Rotherham to be scrapped .\nFleet details .\nNamed units .\nSome units have names , these are as follows :\n- 315817 : Transport for London ( unit scrapped )\n- 315829 : London Borough of Havering Celebrating 40 years ( unit scrapped )\n- 315845 : Herbie Woodward ( unit scrapped )\n- 315857 : Stratford Connections ( denamed )",

    "story": "Jussi Jääskeläinen\nJussi Albert Jääskeläinen ( ; born 19 April 1975 ) is a Finnish football coach and retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper .\nDuring his career , Jääskeläinen most notably represented Bolton Wanderers from 1997 until 2012 , making 530 appearances across all competitions . He left Bolton for West Ham United at the end of the 2011–12 season , moving on after three seasons to Wigan Athletic on a free transfer . In his first season with Wigan , he won the League One title . He left Wigan after two seasons to join Indian club ATK , where he retired in 2018 .\nJääskeläinen earned 56 caps for the Finland national team , making his debut in 1998 and retiring from international football in 2010 .\nClub career .\nJääskeläinen was born in Mikkeli , and made his Veikkausliiga debut for MP Mikkeli in 1992 , becoming the clubs first choice goalkeeper in 1994 . In 1996 , he moved to VPS Vaasa where he spent two seasons .\nBolton Wanderers .\nJääskeläinen was bought by manager Colin Todd for £100,000 for Bolton Wanderers of the Football League First Division in 1997 . He soon established himself as the clubs first choice keeper , though a cruciate ligament injury ruled him out for half of Boltons 2000–01 promotion season .\nIn October 2006 he saved two penalties in one match from Blackburn Rovers Benni McCarthy and Jason Roberts to secure a 1–0 away win . On 13 May 2007 , Jääskeläinen received Boltons Player of the Year Award and also the Players Player of the Year Award after helping Bolton secure a UEFA Cup spot for only the second time in their history . Despite much speculation linking him with a move away from Bolton when his contract expired following the 2007–08 season , Jääskeläinen agreed a new four-year contract on 11 June , which he signed on 9 July .\nHis 400th appearance came against Manchester City on 2 November 2008 , with his 400th start coming six days later against Hull City . In January 2009 he saved another penalty from Benni McCarthy in a match against Blackburn Rovers , now managed by his former manager Sam Allardyce , to secure a 2–2 draw . After twelve years , Jääskeläinen was granted a testimonial match against Hibernian in August 2009 in which he kept a clean sheet .\nHis 500th appearance came against Birmingham City on 12 March 2011 in an FA Cup Quarter-Final and his 500th start a week later at Manchester United .\nIn 2012 , in the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards , a double-save from Jääskeläinen against Manchester United on 20 October 2001 came third in a poll deciding the best save in the Premier Leagues 20-year existence .\nAt the end of the 2011–12 season Bolton were relegated from the Premier League and Jääskeläinen rejected a two-year contract bringing an end to his 15-year stay with the club . He made 530 appearances in all competitions , putting him joint third in Boltons all-time appearance list .\nWest Ham United .\nOn 13 June 2012 , West Ham confirmed that Jääskeläinen had agreed personal terms on a one-year deal with an option for a second year . Jääskeläinen was once again reunited with former manager Sam Allardyce , under whom he worked for eight years at Bolton Wanderers . He made his debut for West Ham on 18 August 2012 in a 1–0 win against Aston Villa . On 12 April 2013 , the option for contract extension was activated , keeping Jääskeläinen with the Hammers until summer 2014 . He played all 38 games of West Hams 2012–13 season , in the Premier League and was named runner-up in the Hammer of the Year . He played 18 games in the next Premier League season before being dropped in January for Adrián .\nOn 4 June 2014 , signed a new one-year contract extension with West Ham keeping him at the club until the end of the 2014–15 season , saying Physically I feel good and I felt good last season so I hope I can carry on from there . Jääskeläinen played just one game for West Ham in the 2014–15 season , coming on for Carlton Cole after Adrián had been sent-off in a goalless draw at Southampton on 11 February 2015 . He was released at the end of the campaign .\nWigan Athletic .\nAfter his release from West Ham , Jääskeläinen trialled with Bradford City . On 11 August 2015 , he signed a one-year deal with Wigan Athletic , newly relegated to League One . Initially back-up to fellow incomer Richard ODonnell , he made his debut on 3 October at the age of 40 , keeping a clean sheet in a goalless draw with Walsall at the DW Stadium .\nOn 31 March 2016 , after his 15 clean sheets in 32 games helped Wigan onto an 18-match unbeaten run and second place in the table , he extended his contract for another season . Wigan ended the season as champions . Following the end of his contract at the end of the 2016–17 season , with Wigan being relegated back to League One after finishing 23rd , Jaaskelainen was one of four players to be released by Wigan .\nATK .\nOn 1 September 2017 , 42-year old Jääskeläinen switched clubs and countries , signing for Indian Super League club ATK . He made his debut three months later in a goalless draw at Jamshedpur FC . On 17 January , he was released after having played as a second choice to Debjit Majumder . Later reports clarified he will remain at the club as a coach , but his playing career had ended .\nInternational career .\nJääskeläinen made his debut for Finland on 25 March 1998 against Malta . He was Finlands second choice behind Antti Niemi for years , but after Niemi retired from international football in 2005 , Jääskeläinen finally became the Finnish number one .\nOn 29 October 2009 , Jääskeläinen announced his retirement from international football having collected 55 caps for his country . In explaining his decision Jääskeläinen stated that he hoped that it would allow him to prolong his club career . However , on 6 October 2010 Jääskeläinen announced his comeback to national team in a match against Hungary as Otto Fredrikson was unable to play because of an injury but confirmed that this was just a one-off .\nCoaching career .\nIn 2018 he was appointed as the goalkeeper coach at Wrexham by manager Sam Ricketts , a former team-mate at Bolton . Due to the speculation over Ricketts job , Jääskeläinen , alongside Graham Barrow and Carl Darlington , took charge of Wrexhams second round FA Cup match against Newport County on 1 December . The match finished 0–0 , meaning a replay would be played . Two days later , the departure of Ricketts was confirmed , and Barrow was named sole caretaker manager until a replacement was found .

    "story": "Pat Sullivan ( film producer )\nPatrick Peter Pat Sullivan ( 22 February 1885 – 15 February 1933 ) was an Australian-American cartoonist , pioneer animator , and film producer best known for producing the first Felix the Cat silent cartoons .\nEarly life .\nSullivan was born in Paddington , New South Wales , the second son of Patrick Sullivan , an immigrant from Ireland and his Sydney-born wife Margaret , née Hayes .\nAround 1909 , Sullivan left Australia and spent a few months in London , England , before moving to the United States around 1910 . He worked as assistant to newspaper cartoonist William Marriner and drew four strips of his own . When Marriner died in 1914 , Sullivan joined the new animated cartoon studio set up by Raoul Barré . In 1915 , Sullivan was fired by Barre for general incompetence . In 1916 , William Randolph Hearst , the newspaper magnate , set up a studio to produce animated cartoons based on his papers strips and hired Barres best animators . Sullivan decided to start his own studio and made a series called Sammy Johnsin based on a Marriner strip on which he had worked . This was followed by a series of shorts starring The Tramp .\nAs Mickey Mouse was gaining popularity among theatre audiences through sound cartoons by late 1928 , Sullivan , after years of refusing to convert Felix to sound , finally agreed to use sound in Felixs cartoons . Unfortunately , Sullivan did not carefully prepare this process and put sound in cartoons that the studio had already completed . By 1930 , Felix had faded from the screen . Sullivan relented in 1933 , and announced that Felix would return in sound , but died that year before production began .\nBy the early 1930s , Sullivans alcoholism had completely consumed him . According to artist George Cannata , Sulivan would often fire employees in a drunken haze , not remembering the next day , when they would return to work as if nothing had happened . According to Shamus Culhane , Sullivan artist Al Eugster recalled that Sullivan was [ t ] he most consistent man in the business—consistent in that he was never sober . According to Otto Messmer , Sullivan drank all day long and was never in a sound enough state of mind to contribute creatively to the cartoons he produced . In later years , much of Sullivans staff was interviewed and claimed Messmer deserved all credit for the Felix characters creation and development , arguing that Sullivan was too sick to contribute or even really run the studio .\nDeath .\nSullivan died on 15 February 1933 in New York City at age 47 from health problems brought on by alcoholism and pneumonia . ( At the time , newspapers attributed his death to only pneumonia. ) He is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton , Pennsylvania .\nCharacter creations .\n- Felix the Cat ( disputed )\n- Great Idea Jerry\n- Old Pop Perkins\n- Johnny Boston Beans\n- Obliging Oliver\nControversies .\nRape conviction .\nIn 1917 , Sullivan was convicted of rape in the second degree of a 14-year-old girl . He spent 9 months and 3 days in prison , during which time his studio went on hiatus .\nRacism .\nSullivan reportedly carried a strong bias against African Americans . According to Rudy Zamora , when he and Eddie Salter tested for positions at the Sullivan studio , they were bested by a young African American boy . Zamora recalled that animator Dana Parker took the black boy [ aside ] and told him that they’ll call him when they needed him , [ as they were ] not hiring anyone that day . But they kept Eddie and I . That was lousy . Then they would have hired this black guy and myself . Ed was third . When Zamora complained about this to Parker , he was told , The old man ( Sullivan ) didn’t want any black guys .\nInvolvement in the creation of Felix the Cat .\nIt is a matter of some dispute whether Felix was created by Sullivan or his top animator Otto Messmer . Some animation historians accepted Messmers claim , as he was the principal animator on the Felix series .\nHowever , Sullivan was drawing cartoons for Paramount Magazine by 1919 and later when he signed a contract as an animator with Paramount Studios in March 1920 , one of the subjects specified in his curriculum vitae was a black cat named Felix who had first appeared in Paramount Magazine as a character named Master Tom in a cartoon series named Feline Follies , tending to support Sullivans claim definitively .\nFirsthand accounts were recorded in print , notably a recollection from 1953 by Australian writer Hugh McCrae , who was sharing an apartment with Pat Sullivan just before Felix was created . It comes properly as a postscript that in New York McCrae shared a flat with Pat Sullivan , the famed creator of Felix , the Cat . When a film about Felix was being planned , Sullivan suggested that McCrae should do the drawings while he ( Sullivan ) supplied the ideas . McCrae refused and has regretted it ever since .\nAustralian cartoonists find the Messmer claim not credible . Messmer came forward decades after Pat Sullivans death , claimed Felix was his creation and placed the place of creation of the lucrative character in his own house , away from his bosss office . He excluded Pat Sullivan completely , and yet the lettering throughout the creation matches Pat Sullivans hand . It is also telling that a cartoon kitten says MUM in Feline Follies , with the Australian/British spelling , rather than MOM , the American spelling ; Messmer is less likely to have written that .\nExternal links .\n- http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/a-chat-with-rudy-zamora/\n- Pat Sullivan biography on Lambiek",

    "story": "Etty Hillesum\nEsther ( Etty ) Hillesum ( 15 January 1914–30 November 1943 ) was the Dutch author of confessional letters and diaries which describe both her religious awakening and the persecutions of Jewish people in Amsterdam during the German occupation . In 1943 she was deported and killed in Auschwitz concentration camp .\nLife .\nEsther ( Etty ) Hillesum was born on 15 January 1914 in her family home in the town of Middelburg , the oldest of the three children – she had two brothers , Jacob or Jaap ( 1916–1945 ) and Michael or Mischa ( 1920–1944 ) – of Levie Hillesum ( 1880–1943 ) and Riva Bernstein ( 1881–1943 ) . After completing school , in 1932 she moved to Amsterdam to study law and Slavic languages . There she met Hendrik ( Hans ) J . Wegerif with whom she had a relationship that she describes in her diaries .\nEtty Hillesum began writing her diary in March 1941 , possibly at the suggestion of her analyst Julius Spier , whom she had been attending to for a month . Although his patient , Etty also became his secretary and friend and eventually his lover . His influence on her spiritual development is apparent in her diaries ; as well as teaching her how to deal with her depressive and egocentric episodes he introduced her to the Bible and St . Augustine and helped her develop a deeper understanding of the work of Rilke and Dostoyevsky .\nHer diaries record the increasing anti-Jewish measures imposed by the occupying German army , and the growing uncertainty about the fate of fellow Jews who had been deported by them . As well as forming a record of oppression her diaries describe her spiritual development and deepening faith in God .\nWhen round-ups of Jews intensified in July 1942 she took on administrative duties for the Jewish Council , voluntarily transferring to a department of Social Welfare for People in Transit at Westerbork transit camp . She worked there for a month , but returned in June 1943 , by which time she had refused offers to go into hiding in the belief that her duty was to support others scheduled to be transported from Westerbork to the concentration camps in German-occupied Poland and Germany . On 5 July 1943 , her personal status was suddenly revoked and she became a camp internee along with her father , mother and brother Mischa .\nOn 7 September 1943 , the family were deported from Westerbork to Auschwitz . Only Jaap Hillesum did not go with them ; he arrived in Westerbork after their removal and in February 1944 was sent to Bergen-Belsen , dying shortly after its liberation in April 1945 .\nEtty Hillesums parents are recorded as having died on 10 September 1943 , suggesting they died in transit or were gassed immediately upon their arrival . Mischa Hillesum remained in Auschwitz until October 1943 , when he was moved to the Warsaw Ghetto , where , according to the Red Cross , he died before 31 March 1944 . Etty died in Auschwitz on 30 November 1943 .\nPersonal growth and philosophy .\nEtty Hillesum’s youth was chaotic and turbulent , possibly resulting from her emotionally unstable family , to which she herself referred as a madhouse . Her diaries reflect the inner turmoil that she experiences during her young adulthood , as well as the healing and growth during the years before her murder .\nRussian authors and Christian mystics likely contributed to Hillesum’s understanding of spirituality . She did not strive for ecstasy , but longed to meet the depth of her own interior and life itself . Her spirituality was not confined to her intellectual\nunderstanding of a greater power and is reflected in her diaries . In the concentration camp of Westerbork , she had unusual experiences of spiritual awakenings and insight : Those two months behind barbed wire have been the two richest and most intense months of my life , in which my highest values were so deeply confirmed . I have learnt to love Westerbork . Hillesum addressed God repeatedly in her diaries , regarding him not as a saviour , but as a power we must nurture inside of us : Alas , there doesn’t seem to be much You Yourself can do about our circumstances , about our lives . Neither do I hold You responsible . You cannot help us , but we must help You and defend Your dwelling place inside us to the last .\nRachel Bremer described Hillesum’s life in two stages the stage of preparation and the stage of test . The preparatory stage refers to Hillesum’s self-reflection and development during her time in Amsterdam . The testing stage , on the other hand , refers to her life at the concentration camp . Still in Amsterdam , Hillesum developed an ideology of showing others the way to their own interior in a time of great adversity – the Nazi terror . Her time at Westerbork – as reflected in her diaries – portrays the redemption of her spirit , while her body was captured and eventually murdered . She neither denies the horror of the Nazi terror , nor identifies with her victimhood . In the midst of extreme conditions , Hillesum develops an awareness of the indestructible beauty of this world . She writes during her time at Westerbork : The sky is full of birds , the purple lupins stand up so regally and peacefully , two little old women have sat down for a chat , the sun is shining on my face – and right before our eyes , mass murder.. . The whole thing is simply beyond comprehension . Hillesum continuously writes from a place of great tenderness , empathy , and realization .\nHillesum suffers great inner turmoil during her young adulthood , but increasingly transforms into a woman of maturity and wisdom . She writes : Everywhere things are both very good and very bad at the same time . The two are in balance , everywhere and always . I never have the feeling that I have got to make the best of things ; everything is fine just as it is . Every situation , however miserable , is complete in itself and contains the good as well as the bad . In touch with the equilibrium of a bigger picture she is aware of , she continuously draws from this place to find meaning in her current reality . On 7 September 1943 , less than 3 months before her murder , she threw a postcard with her final words out of a train : Opening the Bible at random I find this : ‘The Lord is my high tower . I am sitting on my rucksack in the middle of a full freight car . Father , Mother , and Mischa are a few cars away . In the end , the departure came without warning.. . We left the camp singing.. . Thank you for all your kindness and care .\nOthers’ views .\nHillesum has repeatedly been referred to as a mystic .\nRichard Layard has spoken with great appreciation of Hillesums view that one must preserve ones inner self , or core .\nRowan Rheingans has drawn on Hillesums writing , particularly on the coexistence of beauty and horror , and on allowing room for sorrow , in her album The lines we draw together .\nThe diaries .\nBefore she left for Westerbork , Etty Hillesum gave her diaries to Maria Tuinzing , with the instruction they be passed to Klaas Smelik for publication , should she not survive . Attempts to have them published proved fruitless until 1979 , when Smeliks son , the director of the Etty Hillesum Research Centre , approached publisher J . G . Gaarlandt . An abridged edition of her diaries appeared in 1981 under the title Het verstoorde leven [ An Interrupted Life ] , followed by a collection of her letters from Westerbork . A complete edition of her letters and diaries was published in Dutch in 1986 and translated into English in 2002 . Her diaries were translated into 18 languages . Her letters were sent to friends and Hillesum’s final postcard was thrown from the train in Westerbork , where it was discovered by Dutch farmers after her death .\nPublications .\n- An interrupted Life : The Diaries of Etty Hillesum 1941-1943\n- Etty Hillesum : An Interrupted Life the Diaries , 1941-1943 and Letters from Westerbork\n- Etty Hillesum : Essential Writings ( Modern Spiritual Masters )\n- Anne Frank and Etty Hillesum : Inscribing Spirituality and Sexuality\n- Etty Hillesum : Letters from Westerbork\nResearch centre and museum .\nOn 13 June 2006 , the Etty Hillesum Research Centre ( EHOC ) was officially opened as part of Ghent University with a celebration at Sint-Pietersplein 5 . It studies and promotes the research of Hillesums World War II letters and diaries .\nThe Centre is directed by Prof . Dr . Klaas A.D . Smelik , who edited and published the Complete edition of the Letters and Diaries , and teaches Hebrew and Judaism at Ghent University . Staff member Dr . Meins G . S . Coetsier is the author of .\nA monument to Etty Hillesum is located in Deventer on the riverfront , and the local secondary schools are named after her .

    "story": "Polish Peoples Party\nThe Polish Peoples Party ( ) , abbreviated to PSL ( traditionally translated as Polish Peasants Party ) , often shortened to ( the populars ) is an agrarian Christian-democratic political party in Poland . It is a member of the European Peoples Party and the European Peoples Party group in the European Parliament .\nThe partys name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Galician Poland , which sent MPs to the parliament in Vienna .\nHistory .\nBefore 1945 .\nThe party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of Rzeszow under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe ( Peoples Party ) . The party changed its name in 1903 to what its known as now . The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful , seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century . In the Second Polish Republic there were a few parties named PSL ( Polish Peoples Party Wyzwolenie , Polish Peoples Party Piast , Polish Peoples Party Left and others ) until they were removed by the Sanacja regime ( see also Peoples Party ) .\nDuring this time , there were two parties using the term Polish Peoples Party , namely Polish Peoples Party Piast and Polish Peoples Party Wyzwolenie ( which were merged into Peoples Party with Stronnictwo Chłopskie ) . During World War II , PSL took part in forming the Polish government in exile .\nUnder the communist regime .\nAfter the war , Stanisław Mikołajczyk , a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile , returned to communist-dominated Poland , where he joined the provisional government and rebuilt PSL . The party hoped to win the Yalta Conference-mandated elections and help establish a parliamentary system in Poland . The communists formed a rival peasant party allied with them . The 1947 parliamentary election was heavily rigged , with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80 percent of the vote . Many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly .\nMikołajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life . The communists then forced the remains of Mikołajczyks PSL to unite with the pro-communist Peoples Party to form the United Peoples Party . The ZSL was a governing partner in the ruling coalition .\nAfter the fall of the regime .\nAround the time of the fall of communism several PSLs were recreated , including Porozumienie Ludowe , Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe-Odrodzenie , and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe ( Wilanów faction ) . In 1989 most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the Solidarity grouping , and in 1990 changed its name to PSL .\nIt remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s , entering into coalitions with the postcommunist Democratic Left Alliance . In the 2001 parliamentary elections , PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance , an alliance which later broke down . Since then , PSL has moved towards more centrist and conservative policies .\nAfter 2004 .\nThe party ran in the 2004 European Parliament election as part of the European Peoples Party ( EPP ) and received 6% of the vote , giving it 4 of 54 Polish seats in the European Parliament . In the 2005 general election , the party received 7% of votes , giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and 2 in the Senate . In the 2007 parliamentary elections , the party placed fourth , with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats , and entered into a governing coalition with the victor , the centre-right conservative Civic Platform .\nIn European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009 .\nIn the 2011 national parliamentary election , Polish Peoples Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and 2 mandates in the Senate . At the 2015 parliamentary election , the PSL dropped to 5.13 percent of the vote , just barely over the 5 percent threshold . With 16 seats , it was the smallest of the five factions in the Sejm .\nSince then PSL has lost even more support to PiS during the 2018 Polish local elections when they lost 87 seats and dropped to 12.07% unlike the 23.9% they got at the last local elections . After this , the party became junior partner in coalitions with Civic Coalition and SLD .\nIn 2019 European election , PSL won 3 seats as a part of the European Coalition .\nFor parliamentary elections in the same year , PSL decided to create centrist and Christian-democratic coalition with or without Civic Platform named as Polish Coalition . However , PO recreated Civic Coalition with Modern and small left-wing parties ( although without major left-wing parties ) . Polish Coalition , apart from PSL , consists of Kukiz15 , Union of European Democrats and another liberal , catholic and regionalist organisations . This coalition resulted in election of 30 members . Majority of them ( 20 ) were members of PSL .\nIdeology .\nThe partys platform is strongly based on neo-agrarianism . On social and ethical issues , PSL opposes abortion , same-sex marriage , soft drug decriminalization , euthanasia and death penalty .\nIn 2019 , the party adopted ( as part of an agreement with Kukiz15 ) in the partys platform direct democracys postulates , including single-member districts and obligatory referendum .\nElection results .\nSupport .\nThe Partys traditional support base consisted of farmers , peasants and rural voters . Voters are generally more social conservative than voters of Civic Platform . The main concurrent in rural areas is national conservative Law and Justice ( PiS ) .\nIn the 2010s the party started to lose support between rural voters ( especially in southeast of Poland ) . In 2019 election PSL gained surprisingly significant support in cities and won mandates ( e . g . in Warsaw and Wrocław ) .\nLeadership .\nChairman :\n- Roman Bartoszcze ( 1990–1991 )\n- Waldemar Pawlak ( 1991–1997 )\n- Jarosław Kalinowski ( 1997–2004 )\n- Janusz Wojciechowski ( 2004–2005 )\n- Waldemar Pawlak ( 2005–2012 )\n- Janusz Piechociński ( 2012–2015 )\n- Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz ( 2015–present )",

She was already a directly elected member of the German Bundestag from 2009 to 2010 , and from April 2010 until her resignation in December of the same year , State Minister for Food , Agriculture , Consumer Protection and Regional Development of Lower Saxony .\nEarly life and career .\nSchober was born in Cologne and grew up in Brühl ( Rhineland ) , where she graduated from the Erzbischöfliches St .

She was the first in her family to graduate from university . During her apprenticeship she worked ( partly as an intern ) in the food industry , the bakery and butcher trade , in canteen kitchens , in retirement homes and in agriculture .

KG in Wildeshausen ( Landkreis Oldenburg ) owned by the PHW Group , in which the turkey hatchery is a limited partner , on suspicion of assistance to illegal employment and illegal temporary employment .

    "story": "Georges Duby\nGeorges Duby ( 7 October 1919 – 3 December 1996 ) was a French historian who specialised in the social and economic history of the Middle Ages . He ranks among the most influential medieval historians of the twentieth century and was one of Frances most prominent public intellectuals from the 1970s to his death .\nBorn to a family of Provençal craftsmen living in Paris , Duby was initially educated in the field of historical geography before he moved into history . He earned an undergraduate degree at Lyon in 1942 and completed his graduate thesis at the Sorbonne under Charles-Edmond Perrin in 1952 . He taught first at Besançon and then at the University of Aix-en-Provence before he was appointed in 1970 to the Chair of the History of Medieval Society in the Collège de France . He remained attached to the Collège until his retirement in 1991 . He was elected to the Académie française in 1987 .\nImpact of the Mâconnais book .\nAlthough Duby authored dozens of books , articles and reviews during his prolific career—for academic as well as popular audiences—his reputation and legacy as a scholar will always be attached to his first monograph , a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled La société aux XIe et XIIe siècles dans la région mâconnaise ( Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the Mâconnais region ) . La société exerted a profound influence on medieval scholarship in the second half of the twentieth century , placing the study of medieval feudal society on an entirely new footing . Working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny , as well as the dioceses of Mâcon and Dijon , Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the Mâconnais region , charting a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000 .\nDuby argued that in early eleventh century , governing institutions—particularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchy—that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the ninth and tenth centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence . The emergence of this new , decentralized society of dynastic lords could then explain such later eleventh-century phenomena as the Peace of God , the Gregorian reform movement and the Crusades .\nFollowing upon this , Duby formulated a famous theory about the Crusades : that the tremendous response to the idea of holy war against the Muslims can be traced to the desire of disinherited ( but well-armed ) second and third sons of this French parvenue aristocracy to make their fortunes by venturing abroad and settling in the Levant . While Dubys theory had long-lasting influence , later scholars such as Jonathan Riley-Smith have done much to discredit it , arguing that there was no large-scale shortage of land in Western Europe at the time , that knights actually lost money going on crusade , and that lay religious sentiment was their primary motivation .\nDubys intensive and rigorous examination of a local society based on archival sources and a broad understanding of the social , environmental and economic bases of daily life became a standard model for medieval historical research in France for decades after the appearance of La société . Throughout the 1970s and 80s , French doctoral students investigated their own corners of medieval France , Italy and Spain in a similar way , hoping to compare and contrast their own results with those of Dubys Mâconnais and its thesis about the transformation of European society at the end of the first millennium .\nAlthough he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre that came to be known as the Annales School , Duby was in many ways the most visible exponent of the Annaliste tradition , emphasizing the need to place people and their daily lives at the center of historical inquiry .\nHistoire des mentalités .\nDuby was also a pioneer in what he and other Annaliste historians in the 1970s and 80s came to call the history of mentalities , or the study of not just what people did , but their value systems and how they imagined their world . In books like The Three Orders : Feudal Society Imagined and The Age of Cathedrals , Duby showed how ideals and social reality existed in dynamic relationship to one another . His distilled biographical essay on William Marshal set the knights career in the context of feudal loyalties , honour and the chivalric frame of mind .\nDubys interest in the idea of historical mentalities extended to thinking about the position of contemporary society vis-a-vis its past . In Le Dimanche de Bouvines ( 1973 ) on the pivotal 1214 battle of Bouvines , Duby chose not to analyze the battle itself , but the ways it had been represented and remembered over time and the role its memory had played in the formation of French ideas about its medieval past . The book remains a classic of Annales-style historiography , eschewing the great man and event-oriented theories of political history in favor of asking questions about the evolution of historical perceptions and ideas over the long term , the longue durée . Duby also wrote frequently in newspapers and popular journals and was a regular guest on radio and television programs promoting historical awareness and support for the arts and social sciences in France . He served as the first director of Société dédition de programmes de télévision ( aka La Sept ) , a French broadcast network dedicated to educational programming .\nHis last book , Lhistoire continue ( History Continues ) ( 1991 ; Engl . trans . 1994 ) , is an intellectual autobiography . In it , Duby stresses the importance of the historian as a public figure who can make the past relevant and exciting to those in the present .\nHonours and awards .\nHonours .\n- Commandeur of the Legion of Honour .\n- Grand officier of the National Order of Merit .\n- Commandeur of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques .\n- Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres .\n- Chevalier of the Order of Agricultural Merit .\n- Officier of the Order of Orange-Nassau .\nAwards .\n- Grand prix Gobert ( 1977 )\n- Prix des Ambassadeurs ( France , 1973 )\n- Lauréat du concours général ( France )\nAcknowledgement .\n- Member of the Académie Française\n- Member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres\n- Member of the British Academy\n- Member of the Medieval Academy of America\n- Member of the Royal Academy of Science , Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium\n- Member of the Accademia dei Lincei\n- Member of the Academia Europaea\n- Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences\n- Member of the Royal Spanish Academy\n- Member of the Real Academia de Buenas Letras de Barcelona\n- Member of the American Philosophical Society\n- Member of the Royal Historical Society\nHonorary degrees .\n- University of Cambridge\n- University of Oxford\n- University of Amsterdam\n- Université catholique de Louvain\n- University of Liège\n- Université de Montréal\n- American University of Paris\n- University of Granada\n- University of Santiago de Compostela\n- John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin\nSelected bibliography .\n- A History of French Civilization ( with Robert Mandrou ) ( New York : Random House ) 1964\n- The Making of the Christian West : 980–1140 ; The Europe of the Cathedrals : 1140–1280 ; Foundations of a New Humanism : 1280–1440 ( Geneva : Skira ) 1966–67\n- Rural Economy and Country Life in the Medieval West ( ( Columbia : University of South Carolina Press ) 1968\n- The Early Growth of the European Economy : Warriors and Peasants from the Seventh to the Twelfth Century ( Ithaca : Cornell ) University Press ) 1974\n- La Société aux XIe et XIIe siècles dans la région mâconnaise ( portions translated in The Chivalrous Society ( 1978 ; repr . 1981 ) )\n- Le Dimanche de Bouvines ( 1973 ) ( Translated in English as The Legend of Bouvines ( 1990 ) )\n- The Year 1000 ( 1974 ) .\n- The Early Growth of the European Economy : Warriors and Peasants from the Seventh to the Twelfth Century ( Ithaca : Cornell University Press ) , 1974 .\n- The Age of the Cathedrals : Art and Society 980–1420 ( 1976 ) .\n- The Three Orders : Feudal Society Imagined ( Chicago : University of Chicago Press ) 1981 .\n- Dialogues , with Guy Lardreau , Paris , Flammarion , 1981 , repr .

    "story": "Burnet R . Maybank\nBurnet Rhett Maybank ( March 7 , 1899September 1 , 1954 ) was a US senator , the 99th governor of South Carolina , and mayor of Charleston , South Carolina . He was the first governor from Charleston since the Civil War and one of only twenty people in United States history to have been elected mayor , governor , and United States senator . During his tenure in the Senate , Maybank was a powerful ally of President Franklin D . Roosevelt . His unexpected death on September 1 , 1954 , from a heart attack , led to Strom Thurmond being elected senator .\nEarly life and family .\nMaybank was born in Charleston , South Carolina , into one of the citys most prominent and wealthy families . He was the direct descendant of five former South Carolina governors : Thomas Smith , Rawlins Lowndes , Robert Gibbes , James Moore and William Aiken , Jr . Additionally , he was related to U.S . Senator Robert Barnwell Rhett . Maybank graduated from the Porter Military Academy ( now known as Porter-Gaud ) and went on to earn a degree from the College of Charleston . He served in the United States Navy during World War I .\nBurnet Maybank was born to Dr . Joseph Maybank VI and Harriet Lowndes Rhett , the first of ten . He married Elizabeth deRosset Myers on June 28 , 1923 . They had three children . After the death of his first wife Maybank married Mary Roscoe Randolph Pelzer Cecil . The second marriage produced no children . His son , Burnet R . Maybank Jr. , went on to become lieutenant governor of South Carolina and a later candidate for governor .\nCareer .\nMayor of Charleston .\nPrior to becoming interested in politics and public service , Maybank had established himself in the cotton export business from 1920 to 1938 . A lifelong Democrat , Maybank entered politics for the first time in 1927 , when he was elected to a four-year term as alderman in Charleston . He rose to mayor pro tempore in 1930 and was then elected mayor of Charleston in 1931 , serving until 1938 . As mayor , Maybank balanced the budget during the Great Depression . He refused an increase of his own salary to $6,000 from $3,600 , and reduced local taxes . Maybank took advantage of federal financing under President Franklin D . Roosevelts administration for slum clearance , construction of public housing and other infrastructure , and support for unemployment payments . He also used a Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) grant to restore the historic Dock Street Theatre , and other grants went to such infrastructure improvements as the city docks and a city incinerator .\nDuring this period Maybank was also appointed as a member of the State Board of Bank Control ( 1932–1933 ) and was chairman of the South Carolina Public Service Authority ( 1935–1939 ) . It supervised a state-sponsored power project on the Santee River . This project , known as the little TVA , was built to control floods as well as provide hydroelectric power for the state . Maybank was a conservative supporter of President Roosevelts New Deal , which funded public works and job programs . But he opposed a share of the presidents labor policies . In addition , he was appointed by the governor as a member of the South Carolina State Advisory Board of the federal Public Works Administration from 1933 to 1934 .\nGovernor of South Carolina .\nWith the favorable publicity from the Santee project , a strong political base in Charleston , and support from his mentor , U.S . Senator James F . Byrnes , Maybank was elected as governor in 1938 . As governor , Maybank tried unsuccessfully to create an adequate state police force , but he did supervise a vigorous prosecution of the criminal element in the state . He strictly enforced liquor and gambling statutes . Maybank personally interceded to prevent to destruction of a high wall around the historic jail in Charleston when it became threatened by a housing project expansion .\nHe fought the Ku Klux Klan , which had reached its peak of revival in the 1920s but was still active . Maybank expanded economic opportunities for blacks in the racially segregated society and tried to improve the quality of black schools in the state , which were historically underfunded . He did nothing to alter the disfranchisement of blacks due to provisions in the state constitution and electoral laws since the turn of the twentieth century .\nSenator and premature death .\nIn January 1941 President Roosevelt appointed Byrnes to the U.S . Supreme Court . Maybank won a special election to fill Byrness US Senate seat in September 1941 , defeating former governor Olin D . Johnston with 56.6 percent of the vote . In 1942 Maybank was elected to the full six-year term , and in 1948 he was reelected without opposition , and served until his death in 1954 .\nMaybank was a powerful senator , part of the southern Democratic block . Maybank served as chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency and as co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Defense Production . As chair of the Subcommittee on Independent Offices , under the Appropriations Committee , Maybank provided critical support to continue the U.S . nuclear weapons program in the early 1950s . He introduced the Maybank Amendment , which was tacked onto the 1953 Defense Appropriations Bill . The amendment relieved the Department of Defense from federal legislation to target a percentage of its expenditures to high unemployment areas . Shortly before his death , Maybank was voted as one of the 20 Most Influential Americans by Fortune Magazine .\nMaybank died of a heart attack at his summer home in Flat Rock , North Carolina in 1954 . He was interred in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston . Several dignitaries attended including then-Governor James F . Byrnes , Strom Thurmond , Ernest F . Hollings , thirteen United States senators , congressmen , and state and local officials . Maybanks sudden death two months before Election Day threw open the 1954 Senate election in South Carolina . Strom Thurmond won as a write-in candidate against the nominee chosen by Democratic party leaders to replace Maybank .\nFollowing Maybanks death , numerous places throughout the state were named in his honor including Maybank Highway , the Burnet Maybank Bridge , and the Maybank Hall at the College of Charleston .\nRecent news .\nBertie Bowman , who became a hearing coordinator for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , published his memoir , Step by Step : A Memoir of Hope , Friendship , Perseverance , and Living the American Dream , in 2009 . He noted the personal support he had received from Senator Maybank . A poor black farmers son , he went to Washington from South Carolina in 1944 as a runaway at age 14 and went to Senator Maybank . He got the youth a janitors position , and took a personal interest in Bowman ( who then had no family in Washington ) . Gradually the young black man advanced while working for the Senate , as he describes in his memoir . In March 2009 Senator Maybanks granddaughter , Elizabeth Parker , traveled to D.C . to meet with Bowman for the first time . A month later , more of the Maybank family met Bowman and his wife , Elaine , in Charleston .\nVice President Joe Biden mentioned Maybank at the dedication ceremony for the Ernest Hollings Special Collections Library at the University of South Carolina on July 23 , 2010 . He said ,\nYou know , an old governor of yours , Burnet Maybank , once wrote an essay entitled , Who Is the South Carolinian ? And heres what it said . He said , theres a deal—there is a deal of kindness about him , describing the South Carolinian . He feels favored when asked for personal assistance . A neighborly spirit prompts him to render service with a scorn for remuneration .",

    "story": "The Blue Boy\nThe Blue Boy ( c . 1770 ) is a full-length portrait in oil by Thomas Gainsborough , now at the Huntington Library , San Marino , California .\nHistory .\nPerhaps Gainsboroughs most famous work , The Blue Boy is thought to be a portrait of Jonathan Buttle ( 1752–1805 ) , the son of a wealthy hardware merchant , although this has never been proven . It is a historical costume study as well as a portrait ; the painting of the youth in his seventeenth-century apparel is regarded as Gainsboroughs homage to Anthony van Dyck and is very similar to Van Dycks portraits of Charles II as a boy .\nGainsborough had already drawn something on the canvas before beginning The Blue Boy , which he painted over . The painting is about life-size , measuring wide by tall . Gainsborough painted the portrait in response to the advice of his rival Sir Joshua Reynolds , who had written :\nThe painting was in Buttles possession until he filed for bankruptcy in 1796 . It was first bought by the politician John Nesbitt and then , in 1802 , by the portrait painter John Hoppner . In about 1809 , The Blue Boy entered the collection of the Earl Grosvenor and remained with his descendants until its sale by the second Duke of Westminster to the dealer Joseph Duveen in 1921 . By then , it had become a great popular favourite in print reproductions after having been exhibited to the public in various exhibitions at the British Institution , Royal Academy and elsewhere .\nIn 1919 , the painting inspired German film producer Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau to create his debut film ( The Boy in Blue ) .\nIn a move that caused a public outcry in Britain , it was then sold to the American railway pioneer Henry Edwards Huntington for $728,800 ( £182,200 ) , according to Duveens bill , a then-record price for any painting . According to a mention in The New York Times dated 11 November 1921 , the purchase price was $640,000 , which would be $ million in .\nBefore its departure to California in 1922 , The Blue Boy was briefly put on display at the National Gallery , where it was seen by 90,000 people ; the Gallerys director Charles Holmes was moved to scrawl farewell words on the back of the painting : Au Revoir , C.H .\nThe Blue Boy inspired pop artist Robert Rauschenberg to pursue a painting career . It is often paired with a painting by Thomas Lawrence called Pinkie that sits opposite to it at the Huntington Library .\nIn popular culture .\nIn Quentin Tarantinos film Django Unchained , the main character Django , a freed slave , chooses to wear an outfit identical to that worn by Gainsboroughs subject in The Blue Boy .\nThe painting also is seen in the movie Batman ( 1989 ) as hanging in Gotham museum and again in the Joker movie hanging in smaller form in the Jokers apartment .\nIn the movie Ghostbusters 2 ( 1989 ) the character Janosz Poha contrasts a large portrait of the fictional 16th century sorcerer Vigo the Carpathian with Gainsboroughs Blue Boy .",

    "story": "John Couch Adams\nJohn Couch Adams FRSE FRAS LLD ( ; 5 June 1819 – 21 January 1892 ) was a British mathematician and astronomer . He was born in Laneast , near Launceston , Cornwall , and died in Cambridge .\nHis most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune , using only mathematics . The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranuss orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton . At the same time , but unknown to each other , the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier . Le Verrier would send his coordinates to Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle , who confirmed the existence of the planet on 23 September 1846 , finding it within 1° of Le Verriers predicted location ( there was , and to some extent still is , some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery ; see Discovery of Neptune ) .\nAdams was Lowndean Professor in the University of Cambridge from 1859 until his death . He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866 . In 1884 , he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain .\nA crater on the Moon is jointly named after him , Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams . Neptunes outermost known ring and the asteroid 1996 Adams are also named after him . The Adams Prize , presented by the University of Cambridge , commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune . His personal library is held at Cambridge University Library .\nEarly life .\nAdams was born at Lidcot , a farm at Laneast , near Launceston , Cornwall , the eldest of seven children . His parents were Thomas Adams ( 1788–1859 ) , a poor tenant farmer , and his wife , Tabitha Knill Grylls ( 1796–1866 ) . The family were devout Wesleyans who enjoyed music and among Johns brothers , Thomas became a missionary , George a farmer , and William Grylls Adams , professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at Kings College London . Tabitha was a farmers daughter but had received a rudimentary education from John Couch , her uncle , whose small library she had inherited . John was intrigued by the astronomy books from an early age .\nJohn attended the Laneast village school where he acquired some Greek and algebra . From there , he went , at the age of twelve , to Devonport , where his mothers cousin , the Rev . John Couch Grylls , kept a private school . There he learned classics but was largely self-taught in mathematics , studying in the Library of Devonport Mechanics Institute and reading Reess Cyclopædia and Samuel Vinces Fluxions . He observed Halleys comet in 1835 from Landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations , predictions and observations , engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities .\nIn 1836 , his mother inherited a small estate at Badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the University of Cambridge . In October 1839 he entered as a sizar at St Johns College , graduating B.A . in 1843 as senior wrangler and first Smiths prizewinner of his year .\nDiscovery of Neptune .\nIn 1821 , Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus , making predictions of future positions based on Newtons laws of motion and gravitation . Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables , leading Bouvard to hypothesise some perturbing body . Adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the perturbation theory . Adams believed , in the face of anything that had been attempted before , that he could use the observed data on Uranus , and utilising nothing more than Newtons law of gravitation , deduce the mass , position and orbit of the perturbing body . On 3 July 1841 , he noted his intention to work on the problem .\nAfter his final examinations in 1843 , Adams was elected fellow of his college and spent the summer vacation in Cornwall calculating the first of six iterations . While he worked on the problem back in Cambridge , he tutored undergraduates , sending money home to educate his brothers , and even taught his bed maker to read .\nApparently , Adams communicated his work to James Challis , director of the Cambridge Observatory , in mid-September 1845 , but there is some controversy as to how . On 21 October 1845 , Adams , returning from a Cornwall vacation , without appointment , twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich . Failing to find him at home , Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution , again without the detailed calculations . Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification . It appears that Adams did not regard the question as trivial , as is often alleged , but he failed to complete a response . Various theories have been discussed as to Adamss failure to reply , such as his general nervousness , procrastination and disorganisation .\nMeanwhile , Urbain Le Verrier , on 10 November 1845 , presented to the Académie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus , showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion . On reading Le Verriers memoir , Airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for English priority in discovery of the planet . The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July . Only after the discovery of Neptune on 23 September 1846 had been announced in Paris did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 August but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet .\nA keen controversy arose in France and England as to the merits of the two astronomers . As the facts became known , there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of Uranus , and each was ascribed equal importance . However , there have been subsequent assertions that The Brits Stole Neptune and that Adamss British contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due . But it is also notable ( and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references ) that Adams himself publicly acknowledged Le Verriers priority and credit ( not forgetting to mention the role of Galle ) in the paper that he gave On the Perturbations of Uranus to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846 :\nAdams held no bitterness towards Challis or Airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world :\nWork style .\nHis lay fellowship at St Johns College came to an end in 1852 , and the existing statutes did not permit his re-election . However , Pembroke College , which possessed greater freedom , elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life .\nDespite the fame of his work on Neptune , Adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism . He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations , often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors . However , he was extraordinarily uncompetitive , reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority , averse to correspondence about it , and forgetful in practical matters . It has been suggested that these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the repetitive behaviours and restricted interests necessary to perform the Neptune calculations , in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy .\nIn 1852 , he published new and accurate tables of the Moons parallax , which superseded Johann Karl Burckhardts , and supplied corrections to the theories of Marie-Charles Damoiseau , Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana , and Philippe Gustave Doulcet .\nHe had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office but John Russell Hind was preferred , Adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator .\nLunar theory — Secular acceleration of the Moon .\nSince ancient times , the Moons mean rate of motion relative to the stars had been treated as being constant , but in 1695 , Edmond Halley had suggested that this mean rate was gradually increasing . Later , during the eighteenth century , Richard Dunthorne estimated the rate as +10 ( arcseconds/century ) in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude , an effect that became known as the secular acceleration of the Moon . Pierre-Simon Laplace had given an explanation in 1787 in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earths orbit . He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations .\nIn 1820 , at the insistence of the Académie des sciences , Damoiseau , Plana and Francesco Carlini revisited Laplaces work , investigating quadratic and higher-order perturbing terms , and obtained similar results , again addressing only a radial , and neglecting tangential , gravitational force on the Moon . Hansen obtained similar results in 1842 and 1847 .\nIn 1853 , Adams published a paper showing that , while tangential terms vanish in the first-order theory of Laplace , they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted . Small terms integrated in time come to have large effects and Adams concluded that Plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66 per century .\nAt first , Le Verrier rejected Adamss results . In 1856 , Plana admitted Adamss conclusions , claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results . However , he soon recanted , publishing a third result different both from Adamss and Planas own earlier work . Delaunay in 1859 calculated the fourth-order term and duplicated Adamss result leading Adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth , sixth and seventh-order terms . Adams now calculated that only 5.7 of the observed 11 was accounted for by gravitational effects . Later that year , Philippe Gustave Doulcet , Comte de Pontécoulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though Peter Andreas Hansen , who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator , declared that the burden of proof rested on Pontécoulant , while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance . Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and , in 1860 , Adams duplicated his results without using a power series . Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adamss results and Plana finally concurred . Adamss view was ultimately accepted and further developed , winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866 . The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration .\nIn 1858 Adams became professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews , but lectured only for a session , before returning to Cambridge for the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry . Two years later he succeeded Challis as director of the Cambridge Observatory , a post Adams held until his death .\nThe Leonids .\nThe great meteor shower of November 1866 turned his attention to the Leonids , whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in 1864 . Newton had asserted that the longitude of the ascending node , that marked where the shower would occur , was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europes leading astronomers .\nUsing a powerful and elaborate analysis , Adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors , which belongs to the Solar System , traverses an elongated ellipse in 33.25 years , and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets , Jupiter , Saturn , and Uranus . These results were published in 1867 .\nSome experts consider this Adamss most substantial achievement . His definitive orbit for the Leonids coincided with that of the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle and thereby suggested the , later widely accepted , close relationship between comets and meteors .\nLater career .\nTen years later , George William Hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion . Adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field , which , following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented Hills .\nOver a period of forty years , he periodically addressed the determination of the constants in Carl Friedrich Gausss theory of terrestrial magnetism . Again , the calculations involved great labour , and were not published during his lifetime . They were edited by his brother , William Grylls Adams , and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers . Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime . He calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant , perhaps somewhat eccentrically , to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd .\nAdams had boundless admiration for Newton and his writings and many of his papers bear the cast of Newtons thought . In 1872 , Isaac Newton Wallop , 5th Earl of Portsmouth , donated his private collection of Newtons papers to Cambridge University . Adams and G . G . Stokes took on the task of arranging the material , publishing a catalogue in 1888 .\nThe post of Astronomer Royal was offered him in 1881 , but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in Cambridge . He was British delegate to the International Meridian Conference at Washington in 1884 , when he also attended the meetings of the British Association at Montreal and of the American Association at Philadelphia .\nHonours .\n- 1847 He is reputed to have been offered a knighthood on Queen Victorias 1847 Cambridge visit but to have declined , either out of modesty , or fear of the financial consequences of such social distinction ;\n- 1847 Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ;\n- 1848 Copley medal of the Royal Society ;\n- 1848 Adams Prize , founded by the members of St Johns College , to be given biennially for the best treatise on a mathematical subject ;\n- 1849 Elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ;\n- 1851 and 1874 President of the Royal Astronomical Society ( 1851–1853 and 1874–1876 ) .\nFamily and death .\nAfter a long illness , Adams died at Cambridge on 21 January 1892 and was buried near his home in St Giles Cemetery , now the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge . In 1863 he had married Miss Eliza Bruce ( 1827–1919 ) , of Dublin , who survived him , and is buried with him . His wealth at death was £32,434 ( £2.6 million at 2003 prices ) .\nMemorials .\n- Memorial in Westminster Abbey with a portrait medallion , by Albert Bruce-Joy ;\n- A bust , by Joy in the hall of St Johns College , Cambridge ;\n- Another youthful bust belongs to the Royal Astronomical Society ;\n- Portraits by :\n- Hubert von Herkomer in Pembroke College ;\n- Paul Raphael Montord in the combination room of St Johns ;\n- A memorial tablet , with an inscription by Archbishop Benson , in Truro Cathedral ;\n- Passmore Edwards erected a public institute in his honour at Launceston , near his birthplace ;\n- Adams Nunatak , a nunatak on Neptune Glacier in Alexander Island in Antarctica , is named after him .\nObituaries .\n- The Times , 22 January 1892 , p . 6 col.d ( link on this page )\n- [ Anon. ] ( 1891–92 ) Journal of the British Astronomical Association 2 : 196–7\nAbout Adams and the discovery of Neptune .\n- from Project Gutenberg\n- Doggett , L .

Herron ( born February 2 , 1978 ) is a Costa Rican footballer .\nClub career .\nBefore joining MLS and the Chicago Fire in late in 2004 , Herron played two years with Costa Rican Herediano , which he led to Costa Ricas 2004s title , by leading the Costa Rican clausuras tournament with 14 goals and 13 assists . He had joined Herediano after he left Santos de Guápiles in December 2002 . Herron had his best season for Chicago in 2006 , when the 2006 Budweiser/Fire Golden Boot winner proved his productivity for the Men in Red by scoring eight goals in 20 games , with 18 starts . Herron put the team on his shoulders in the teams 2006 Lamar Hunt U.S . Open Cup championship run , scoring four goals and one assist through the competition . His assist and game-winning goal against the Los Angeles Galaxy in the Final at Toyota Park helped the Fire clinch an MLS club-record fourth title to the trophy case .\nAfter two and a half seasons in Chicago , he decided to get back to Club Sport Herediano on a loan from Chicago , but soon after that was sent to Columbus for the second pick in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft ( which turned out to be Bakary Soumare ) and forward Ryan Coiner . In the MLS Reserve Division he started and played one game for the Crew Reserves , notching one goal in 79 minutes of play .\nIn February 2008 , Herron left Puntarenas and re-signed with Chicago Fire . On November 26 , 2008 , he was waived by Chicago and he returned to Herediano for the 2009 Verano season . In January 2010 he joined Ramonense and in June 2010 he moved to Guatemala to play for USAC . In summer 2011 he returned to his hometown club after 13 years .\nHe returned to the United States in January 2012 when he signed with Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League . In summer 2013 he left Fort Lauderdale to join Atlanta Silverbacks , but left them in August 2013 without any game played for them .\nControversy .\nOn January 11 , 2006 , Herron was suspended for six games without pay for his behavior that led to a red card in a 1–0 loss to the New England Revolution during the Eastern Conference Championship game the previous November 6 . According to the MLS Soccer Disciplinary Committee , Herron was disciplined for making unacceptable physical contact with the referee Terry Vaughn and assistant referee George Gansner , conduct that led to him being sent off in stoppage time . Adding to the severity of his punishment was the fact that Herron returned to the field after the game .\nOn April 19 , 2007 , Herron again was involved in a controversial incident during a game against the Revolution . He elbowed New Englands Jay Heaps early in a nationally televised game on MLS Primetime Thursday . Herron did not receive a penalty card , because neither the referee , nor a linesman , saw the action . ESPN commentator Eric Wynalda called the foul , the worst Ive seen in a long time . Herron was suspended for four games and fined $6,000 . According to Herron , the elbow was in response to Jay Heaps grabbing his private area as well as xenophobic and racist comments .\nInternational career .\nHerron made his debut for Costa Rica in a November 2002 friendly match against Ecuador , also recording his first international goal , and earned a total of 25 caps , scoring 7 goals . He represented his country in 9 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 2003 UNCAF Nations Cup and 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup . Being an unmovable striker in Jorge Luis Pintos squad and scoring the goal which took Costa Rica to the quarterfinals in the 2004 Copa América held in Chile . He tallied 11 goals in eight games with the Costa Rican U-23 squad during Olympic Qualifying from 1999–2000 .\nHis final international was an August 2009 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Honduras .\nPersonal life .\nHe has a son named Dyan Denilson and a daughter named Mia N . Herron . He grew up playing in the streets of Puerto Limón , Costa Rica . Herron is a big basketball and Chicago Bulls fan .

Initially , Lee failed to crack his way into Forests first team . However , the departure of Stan Collymore to Liverpool saw him feature for the first team . In the 1995–96 season he scored eight league goals in 28 games .\nFollowing two loan spells , back at his first club Charlton and at Grimsby Town , Lee was transferred to Watford in 1997 for £200,000 – the same fee paid by Forest three years earlier – and played in their 1997–98 Second Division championship-winning side , scoring ten goals . However , Lees refusal to uproot his family from Nottingham caused tension with manager Graham Taylor , who sold him to Chesterfield early in the 1998–99 season for £250,000 .\nSince then , he has played for Peterborough United ( 2000–2003 ) , Falkirk ( 2003–2004 ) , Boston United ( 2004–2006 ) .

He was the director of several academic libraries over his career and was respected for developing collections that promoted the history of African Americans ; he was also instrumental in creating reference services and building library collections for multiple libraries in Africa . Van Jackson was part of a group that successfully challenged voter discrimination against African Americans in 1944 in Atlanta , Georgia .\nEarly life and education .\nWallace Van Jackson was born in Richmond , Virginia on May 6 , 1900 .\nIn 1934 he received bachelors degrees from Virginia Union University and a library science degree from Hampton Institute . The following year he earned a Masters of Arts in library science from the University of Michigan . He also studied at the University of Chicago Graduate Library School from 1939 to 1941 .\nLibrary career .\nVan Jackson was appointed as head librarian of Virginia Union University in 1927 and worked there until 1934 . While at VUU , he taught one of the earliest courses on African-American history .\nBeginning in 1941 , he taught reference and collection development at the Atlanta University School of Library Science . He became the first black librarian of Atlanta University in 1941 , serving in that position until 1947 . In 1947 he accepted an invitation to work for the United States Information Agency as a public affairs officer in Monrovia , Liberia . While abroad , he also attended the UNESCO Library School held in England as the representative of the Library of Congress .\nVan Jackson accepted an offer to head the library at Texas Southern University in 1949 .

    "story": "Manuel Rosenthal\nManuel Rosenthal ( 18 June 1904 – 5 June 2003 ) was a French composer and conductor who held leading positions with musical organizations in France and America . He was friends with many contemporary composers , and despite a considerable list of compositions is mostly remembered for having orchestrated the popular ballet score Gaîté Parisienne from piano scores of Offenbach operettas , and for his recordings as a conductor .\nEarly life and career .\nRosenthal was born in Paris to Anna Devorsosky , of Russian-Jewish descent , and a French father he never met . His surname was taken from his stepfather , Bernard Rosenthal .\nHe started his musical studies on violin at age 6 , which he played in cafés and cinemas after his stepfathers death in 1918 to support his mother and sisters . In 1920 , he entered the Conservatoire in Paris but eventually left it after failing to win an expected first prize . In addition to continuing his violin studies with Alterman and Jules Boucherit and playing in theatre and cinema bands , he also studied composition . Around this time he met Léo Sir , inventor of string instruments known as the dixtuor , and was persuaded to play the sursoprano ( a 4th higher than the violin ) and find composers to write for this new medium . Through this Rosenthal met eminent young Parisian composers of whom Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger were the most distinguished , and also contributed his own music to a recital in Paris in October 1921 .\nHis Sonatine for two violins and piano , composed for a sight-reading examination , was acclaimed after its performance at the 99th concert of the Société musicale indépendante in Paris at the end of October 1924 , attended by both Nadia Boulanger and Alexis Roland-Manuel . After a stint in the military he became Maurice Ravels third and final student , seeing him once or twice a month while also having lessons in counterpoint and fugue from Jean Huré . while continuing to play violin in the Moulin Rouge and Casino de Paris café orchestras . Ravels encouragement ultimately led to his winning the Prix Blumenthal ( worth 20,000 francs ) in 1928 . Ravel lobbied the directors of the Opéra-Comique to get Rosenthals one-act opera Rayon des soieries performed there in June 1930 . He also arranged for Rosenthals conducting debut , at a concert composed of Rosenthals own music in 1928 .\nConducting career .\nHis conducting career began in earnest in 1934 , when he became percussionist and assistant conductor of the Orchestre National de France , to Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht . In 1936 , Georges Mandel invited him to conduct the Orchestre de Radio PTT . As his fame as a conductor grew , he was attacked in Action Française in 1937 by Lucien Rebatet , who demanded his expulsion from his radio conductorship . In the same year Serge Koussevitzky , in Paris during the Exposition , invited Rosenthal to become assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony under him – an offer reiterated after a Salle Pleyel concert on the eve of war in 1939 . After Ravels death in 1937 , and following the success of Gaîté Parisienne , he became a close colleague of great Russian émigré composer Igor Stravinsky .\nRosenthals musical career was interrupted by World War II when , as a corporal in the 300th infantry regiment stationed in 1939 in Alsace near the Rhine , he was taken prisoner by the Germans in May 1940 . Still musically active even as a POW , he not only organized concerts in the camp he was interned in but even composed an operetta based on a play by Georges Courteline . Included in a POW exchange , he was sent back to the occupied zone , arrived back in Paris in March 1941 and escaped to Marseille in the Zone libre ( free zone ) with the help of Roland-Manuel . But he was arrested in Besançon in September 1941 while trying to see his son and sentenced to six months forced labor . With the assistance of a German officer , however , he got the necessary papers to escape back to Marseille . Later in 1942 , he returned to Paris and courageously joined the Resistance , working with eminent musical colleagues Désormière , Durey , Delvincourt , Charles Munch and others .\nUpon the liberation in 1944 , he returned to the Orchestre National de France to become their principal conductor , a post he held until 1947 . The first concert consisted of works from each of the Allied countries , including the Hymne à la Justice by Magnard . He made sure a wide range of contemporary music was played , and the first season included a complete Stravinsky cycle . In his final year with the orchestra , he brought it to England to join Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic in a concert organized by Jack Hylton that filled the Harringay Arena with 13,500 listeners .\nIn early 1946 , Rosenthals first conductorship in the USA was with the St . Louis Symphony Orchestra . Having accepted the post of composer-in-residence at the College of Puget Sound , he was invited to become music director of the Seattle Symphony , which he conducted from 1948–1951 while undertaking guest engagements in San Francisco and Buenos Aires . He then went to Algiers to conduct there and in Tunis during the winter of 1952-53 .\nHe was music director of the Orchestre Symphonique de Liège from 1964-1967 , and professor of conducting at the Paris Conservatoire from 1962 to 1974 , where he established a more demanding schedule for his students , who included Yan Pascal Tortelier , Eliahu Inbal , Jacques Mercier , Marc Soustrot and Jean-Claude Casadesus . He conducted some of the first modern performances of Jean-Philippe Rameaus Zoroastre , at the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux and the Opéra-Comique in 1964 . The BBC in Manchester invited him to conduct an opera of his choice in 1973 , which turned out to be Emmanuel Chabriers Le roi malgré lui , for which he chose a French cast .\nIn February 1981 , Rosenthal made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera New York in a mixed-bill of 20th century French stage works , returning in 1983 for Francis Poulencs 1957 operatic masterpiece Dialogues des carmélites and for further appearances in 1986-87 . He returned to Seattle in 1986 to conduct Richard Wagners Ring cycle at the Seattle Opera .\nHe conducted the first performance of Claude Debussys radical 1902 operatic masterpiece Pelléas et Mélisande in Russia , in Moscow in 1988 , and later that year premiered the same work in Caracas , Venezuela . In 1992 , he conducted a production of Padmâvatî by Albert Roussel at the Opera Bastille .\nComposer .\nRosenthal composed prolifically in many classical genres , including operas , operettas , ballets , 13 works for orchestra , choral works both with orchestra and a cappella , works for solo voice and orchestra , chamber music , and music for voice and piano as well as for solo piano . The wide variety of his work , in terms of both genre and tone , reflects his refusal to accept the stylistic compartmentalization prevalent in Paris in the 1920s .\nHis reputation as a composer was sealed in France with Jeanne dArc , first performed in 1936 , although this was followed by a production of the light-hearted one-act operetta La Poule Noire of 1937 .\nHis best-known compositional work was not his own , the 1938 ballet Gaîté Parisienne orchestrated from operetta selections by Jacques Offenbach ( copied manually by assistants who chose them from piano scores they speed-read in the Harvard University music library , the most complete repository of Offenbach scores known at that time ) . The commission by Léonide Massine was originally entrusted to Roger Désormière , but for lack of time Désormière asked his friend Rosenthal to take over the project . Rosenthal was initially reluctant , but fulfilled the commission . Massine rejected the score but , after arbitration by Igor Stravinsky , finally accepted the work and choreographed the ballet , which turned out to be a major success . He also orchestrated works by Federico Mompou and Ravel .\nHe was a fluent composer of choral and sacred works , such as La Pietà dAvignon ( 1943 ) , Trois pièces liturgiques ( 1944 ) and Missa Deo gratias ( 1953 ) . Parts of his Saint François dAssise may have influenced Olivier Messiaen , who wrote an extensive opera on the same subject .\nIn 1965 his serious opera Hop , Signor ! was a disappointment in Toulouse and at the Opéra-Comique .\nWorks .\nStage works .\n- Rayon des soieries , 1923-1926 , opéra bouffe in one act\n- Un baiser pour rien ou La folle du logis , 1928-1929 , ballet in one act\n- Les Bootleggers , 1932 , comédie musicale in one act\n- La Poule noire , 1933-1937 , comédie musicale in one act\n- Gaîté Parisienne , 1938 , ballet in one act d’après Offenbach\n- Que le diable lemporte , 1948 , ballet in one act\n- Les femmes au tombeau , 1956 , drame lyrique in one act\n- Hop , Signor ! 1957-1961 , drame lyrique in three acts\nOrchestral .\n- Sérénade , 1927\n- Jeanne dArc , 1934–36\n- Les petits métiers , 1933 ( Le Maréchal ferrant , L’Herboriste , Le Montreur de Marionnettes , Le Veilleur de Nuit , Le Facteur Déodat , Le Barbier , La Marchande d’Oublies , Le Rémouleur , La Nounou , Le petit Télégraphiste )\n- Musique de table , 1941 ( Entrée de Convives , Salade russe , Matelote d’Anguilles , Quenelles lyonnaises , Filet de Bœuf , Jardinière de Légumes , Cuissot de Chevreuil , Salade de Saison , Fromage de Montagne , Bombe glacée , Corbeille de fruits , Café , Liqueurs , Cigares , Conversations d’après diner )\n- Noce Villageoise , 1941\n- Symphonies de Noël , 1947\n- Magic Manhattan , 1948\n- Symphony in C , 1949\n- Offenbachiana , 1953\n- Rondes Françaises , 1955\nVocal , choral .\n- Saint François dAssise , 1936–39\n- Trois burlesques , 1941\n- La pietà d’Avignon , 1943\n- Cantate pour le temps de la Nativité , 1943–44\n- Deux sonnets de Jean Cassou , 1944\n- A choeur vaillant , 1952–53\n- Missa Deo Gratias , 1953\n- Trois pièces liturgiques , 1958\nInstrumental .\n- Sonatine for two violins and piano , 1922\n- Saxophone-Marmelade , 1929\n- Les Soirées du Petit Juas , string quartet , 1942\n- Aesopi Convivium ( violin , piano , orchestra ) , 1947-1948\nSelected recordings .\n- Debussy : Orchestral works - Prélude à laprès-midi dun faune , Images pour orchestre , Jeux , Nocturnes , La Mer ; Orchestra of the Opéra de Paris , conducted by Manuel Rosenthal .

Philips GL5664\nPersonal life .\nRosenthal was married twice . His first marriage was to a chorus girl , Mlle . Troussier , in 1927 . He had begun a relationship with soprano Claudine Verneuil while still married to his first wife , but during his tenure in Seattle presented Claudine as his wife even though he had not divorced Troussier .

    "story": "Osnabrück\nOsnabrück ( ; ; archaic Osnaburg ) is a city in the German state of Lower Saxony . It is situated on the river Hase in a valley penned between the Wiehen Hills and the northern tip of the Teutoburg Forest . With a population of 168,145 Osnabrück is one of the four largest cities in Lower Saxony . The city is the centrepoint of the Osnabrück Land region as well as the District of Osnabrück .\nThe founding of Osnabrück was linked to its positioning on important European trading routes . Charlemagne founded the Diocese of Osnabrück in 780 . The city was also a member of the Hanseatic League . At the end of the Thirty Years War ( 1618–1648 ) , the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated in Osnabrück and the nearby city of Münster . In recognition of its role as the site of negotiations , Osnabrück later adopted the title Friedensstadt ( city of peace ) . The city is also known as the birthplace of anti-war novelist Erich-Maria Remarque and painter Felix Nussbaum .\nMore recently Osnabrück has become well known for its industry . Numerous companies in the automobile , paper , steel and grocery sectors are located in the city and its surrounding area.<ref ( application/pdf-Objekt ) ></ref> In spite of the massive destruction inflicted on the city during World War II , the Altstadt ( old town ) was eventually reconstructed extensively with designs loyal to the original medieval architecture there . Osnabrück was also the home of the largest British garrison outside the United Kingdom . Osnabrücks modern , urban image is enhanced by the presence of more than 22,000 students studying at the University and the University of Applied Sciences . Although part of the state of Lower Saxony , historically , culturally and linguistically Osnabrück is considered part of the region of Westphalia .\nName .\nThe origin of the name Osnabrück is disputed . The suffix -brück suggests a bridge over or to something ( from German Brücke = bridge ) but the prefix Osna- is explained in at least two different ways : the traditional explanation is that todays name is a corruption of Ossenbrügge ( westphalian meaning oxen bridge ) , which is etymologically and historically impossible , because the town is older than this corruption of consonants ( documented in 13 . century , Osnabrück was founded in 8 . century ) , but others state that it is derived from the name of the Hase River which is arguably derived from Asen ( Æsir ) , thus giving Osnabrück the meaning bridge to the gods , and previously Tacitus named people living near the grey river ( Hase ) Chasuarii . It may also be noted that Osnabrück is situated on the northern end of the Teutoburg Forest , which until the 19th century was known as the Osning . The way in which the citys name is pronounced can also serve as a means of telling if the speaker is a native of Osnabrück or a visitor : most locals stress the last syllable , while those from elsewhere tend to stress the first one .\nThe city gave its name to the textile fabric of osnaburg .\nHistory .\nMedieval .\nOsnabrück initially developed as a marketplace next to the bishopric founded by Charlemagne , King of the Franks , in 780 . Some time prior to 803 , the city became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück . Although the precise date is uncertain , it is likely that Osnabrück is the oldest bishopric in Lower Saxony .\nIn the year 804 Charlemagne was said to have founded the Gymnasium Carolinum in Osnabrück . This would make it the oldest German Gymnasium school , but the charter date is disputed by historians , some of whom believe it could be a forgery .\nIn 889 the town was given merchant , customs , and coinage privileges by King Arnulf of Carinthia . Osnabrück was first referred to in records as a city in 1147 . A decade later , Emperor Frederick Barbarossa granted the city fortification privileges ( Befestigungsrecht ) . Most of the towers which were part of the original fortifications are still visible in the city . Osnabrück became a member of the Hanseatic League in the 12th century , as well as a member of the Westphalian Federation of Cities .\nThe history of the town in the later Middle Ages was recorded in a chronicle by Albert Suho , one of Osnabrücks most important clerics in the 15th century .\nEarly Modern age .\nFrom 1561 to 1639 there was a considerable amount of social unrest and tension in Osnabrück due to the Protestant Reformation , the Thirty Years War and also witch hunting . In 1582 , during the rule of Mayor Hammacher ( 1565–1588 ) , 163 women were executed as alleged witches ; most of them were burned alive . In total , 276 women were executed , along with 2 men who had been charged with wizardry .\nThe first Lutheran services were held in Osnabrück in 1543 . Over the next century , Lutheranism expanded in the city and several Protestant bishops were elected . However , the Catholic churches continued to operate , and the city never became completely Lutheran . After the Thirty Years War broke out , a Catholic bishop was elected in 1623 , and the city was occupied by troops of the Catholic League in 1628 . The Gymnasium Carolinum was upgraded to a Jesuit university in 1632 , but the university was closed a year later when the city was taken by Swedish troops and restored to Protestant control .\nPeace negotiations took place in Osnabrück and the nearby city of Münster from 1643 to 1648 . The twin Treaties of Osnabrück and Münster , collectively known as the Peace of Westphalia , ended the Thirty Years War . Osnabrück was officially recognized as bi-confessional Catholic and Lutheran . The prince-bishopric would be held alternately by a Catholic bishop and a Lutheran bishop . The Protestant bishop would be selected from the descendants of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg , with priority given to the cadets of what became the House of Hanover . From 1667 , prince-bishop Ernest Augustus , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , built the new baroque palace . His son , George I of Great Britain , died in the palace , at the time residence of his younger brother , prince-bishop Ernest Augustus , Duke of York and Albany , on a travel on 11 June 1727 .\nIn the early 18th century , renowned local jurist and social theorist Justus Möser wrote a highly influential constitutional history of the town , the Osnabrücker Geschichte . Following the Seven Years War , the towns population fell below 6,000 , however an economic revival linked to the linen and tobacco industries caused it to rise again from the 1780s onwards .\n19th century .\nThe French Revolutionary Wars brought Prussian troops into the city in 1795 , followed by the French in 1803 . As a result , the towns population was kept below 10,000 for the whole first decade of the 19th century . The Napoleonic period saw possession of the city change hands several times . Control of Osnabrück passed to the Electorate of Hanover in 1803 during the German Mediatisation , and then briefly to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1806 . From 1807 to 1810 the city was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia , after which it passed to the First French Empire . After 1815 , it became part of the Kingdom of Hanover .\nThe towns first railway line was built in 1855 , connecting it with Löhne . Further rail connections appeared over the following decades , connecting Osnabrück with Emden from 1856 , Cologne from 1871 and Hamburg from 1874 . In 1866 , Osnabrück was annexed by Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War and administered as part of the Province of Hanover . Growth of the local economy and population was fuelled by expansion in the engineering and textile industries , with the Hammersen Weaving Mill established in 1869 and the Osnabrücker Kupfer- und Drahtwerk metallurgical firm following in 1873 . The later 19th century also saw growth in the number of schools and the arrival of electricity and modern sanitation .\n20th century .\nBy 1914 , Osnabrück had over 70,000 inhabitants . The outbreak of the First World War necessitated food rationing ; the Allied blockade and a harsh winter in 1917 led to further shortages . Following Germanys defeat in 1918 , a council made up of workers and soldiers took control during the November Revolution , but were replaced by the new Weimar Republic the following year . Similarly to many other German cities , Osnabrück experienced considerable inflation and unemployment in the 1920s , with over 2,000 out of work by 1923 and nearly 14,000 receiving some form of government assistance by 1928 .\nPolitically , Osnabrück in the 1920s was a stronghold of support for the Social Democrats and the Catholic Centre Party . However , in the Reichstag elections of September 1930 , the Nazi Party received the greatest percentage of votes in the city ( nearly 28% ) – a more than seven-fold increase from their electoral performance in Osnabrück two years prior . During the campaigns prior to the two federal elections in 1932 , both Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels made well-attended speeches in the city .\nFollowing the Nazis seizure of power in January 1933 , Osnabrück was subjected to the implementation of National Socialist economic , political , and social programmes . These resulted in economic growth for ethnic Germans who did not run afoul of the new regime , and the town went from having over 10,000 unemployed in early 1933 to actually having a labour shortage five years later . However , dissenters , supporters of opposition parties and German Jews ( who had experienced centuries of discrimination in the city ) did not share in this growth and found themselves discriminated against , imprisoned or forced to close their businesses and leave town . During World War II , both Jews and Romany were deported to concentration camps and extermination camps en masse .\nThe war ended for Osnabrück on 4 April 1945 , when the XVII Corps of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomerys Second Army entered the city with little resistance . By the end of the war the city had been extensively bombed and required major reconstructive programmes following the wars end . Leading Nazis fled the city and the British appointed a new mayor , Johannes Petermann . However , during the allied occupation of Germany a British military governor , Colonel Geoffrey Day was placed in charge of administering the city . Relations between the occupiers and the citizens of Osnabrück were generally peaceful , though tensions existed ; some minor fights broke out between British soldiers and local youths and some Osnabrückers resented the relationships that developed between the occupiers and local women . Additionally , the British took over more than seventy homes for their own use by the middle of 1946 . Amidst shortages , the black market thrived and became one of the main focuses of police activity .\nAfter World War II West Germany realigned its states ; Osnabrück became part of the new state of Lower Saxony in 1946 . The British continued to maintain Osnabrück Garrison , a garrison near the city , which at one point was the largest British garrison in the world , housing some 4,000 troops and employing around 500 local civilians . It was the target of a PIRA attack in 1996 . Due to budget cuts , the troops were withdrawn in 2008 and the property returned to the local government .\nAfter three centuries , the city finally obtained its university when the government of Lower Saxony established the University of Osnabrück in 1974 .\nLargest foreign resident groups in Osnabrück :\nMain sights .\n- Town Hall\n- St .

All of the types of German grammar schools are represented in the city , including seven Gymnasien . Gymnasium Carolinum claims to be the oldest still existing school in Germany . Another well-known Gymnasium is the Ursulaschule , a private school , located directly opposite the Carolinum . The University of Osnabrück invested heavily in infrastructure to take on more students for the following years .\nSport .\nThe citys football team is VfL Osnabrück , founded in 1899 . Its basketball team was founded the same year .\nTransport .\nThe city of Osnabrück is connected by road to the A1 , the A30 and the A33 .\nIt shares its airport with Münster .\nOsnabrück Hauptbahnhof ( central railway station ) is an important rail travel hub . Travellers from the Netherlands heading to either Hamburg , Denmark , or Eastern Europe often have to change here .\nAn extensive bus network operated by the Stadtwerke Osnabrück ( public utility provider ) provides public transport within the city and the surrounding region . The central hub is situated on Neumarkt close to the main shopping street , roughly 10 minutes walk from the railway station .\nDistricts of Osnabrück .\nThe city is divided into 23 districts :\nTwin towns – sister cities .\nOsnabrück is twinned with :\n- Haarlem , Netherlands ( 1961 )\n- Angers , France ( 1964 )\n- Gmünd , Austria ( 1971 )\n- Derby , United Kingdom ( 1976 )\n- Greifswald , Germany ( 1988 )\n- Tver , Russia ( 1991 )\n- Evansville , United States ( 1991 )\n- Gwangmyeong , South Korea ( 1997 )\n- Çanakkale , Turkey ( 2004 )\n- Vila Real , Portugal ( 2005 )\n- Hefei , China ( 2006 )\nTwinning with Derby .\nPreviously Osnabrück had made contact with the British authorities as early as 1948 , hoping to find an English twin town and therefore achieve greater understanding with their former enemies in the Second World War . Unfortunately , this attempt was unsuccessful and Osnabrück did not actively consider the idea again for another quarter-century . The twinning agreement with Derby was signed on 17 February 1976 . Every year since then the two cities have exchanged envoys . Derby also has a square named after Osnabrück in honour of the twinning arrangement ; this features an obelisk among other things .\nNotable people .\nPublic Service & commerce .\n- Albert Suho ( c . 1380 – c . 1450 ) , clergyman , theologian , historian\n- Friedrich Staphylus ( 1512–1564 ) , theologian\n- Johann Wilhelm Petersen ( 1649–1727 ) , evangelical theologian\n- Ernest Augustus , Duke of York and Albany ( 1674–1728 ) , brother of George I of Great Britain\n- Sophia von Kielmansegg , Countess of Darlington ( 1675–1725 ) , courtier and a half-sister of George I of Great Britain\n- Justus Möser ( 1720–1794 ) , jurist and social theorist\n- Ernst zu Münster ( 1766–1839 ) , politician , statesman in the service of House of Hannover\n- Bernhard Rudolf Abeken ( 1780–1866 ) , philologist\n- Karl Fortlage ( 1806–1881 ) , philosopher\n- Heinrich Abeken ( 1809–1872 ) , evangelical theologian\n- Friedrich Blass ( 1843–1907 ) , classical scholar\n- Friedrich Westmeyer ( 1873–1917 ) , politician and trade unionist\n- Walter Warlimont ( 1894–1976 ) , General of the Artillery\n- Elfriede Scholz ( 1903–1943 ) , victim of national socialism\n- Hans Georg Calmeyer ( 1903–1972 ) , attorney , Righteous Among the Nations\n- Fritz Buntrock ( 1909–1948 ) , SS officer and war criminal\n- Rudolf Beckmann ( 1910–1943 ) , SS-Oberscharführer and war criminal\n- Franz Lucas ( 1911–1994 ) , concentration camp doctor\n- Wilhelm Schitli ( 1912–1945? ) , SS officer\n- Hubertus Brandenburg ( 1923–2009 ) , Bishop of Stockholm\n- Reinhold Remmert ( 1930–2016 ) , mathematician\n- Jürgen Kühling ( 1934–2019 ) , lawyer , former judge at the Federal Constitutional Court\n- Inge Schmitz-Feuerhake ( born 1935 ) , physicist and mathematician\n- Rudolf Seiters ( born 1937 ) , politician ( CDU ) , Vice-President of the Bundestag 1998–2002\n- Hans Huchzermeyer ( born 1939 ) , physician and musicologist\n- Paul Kirchhof ( born 1943 ) , former judge of the Federal Constitutional Court , prof . of tax law\n- Hans-Gert Pöttering ( born 1945 ) , lawyer and politician , former President of the European Parliament\n- Ferdinand Kirchhof ( born 1950 ) , judge at the Federal Constitutional Court , professor of tax law\n- Thomas Bellut ( born 1955 ) , journalist\n- Olaf Scholz ( born 1958 ) , politician ( SPD )\n- Christian Wulff ( born 1959 ) , politician and lawyer , President of Germany from 2010 to 2012\n- Sabine R .

    "story": "Louise Haigh\nLouise Margaret Haigh ( born 22 July 1987 ) is a British Labour Party politician currently serving as the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . She was elected as the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Sheffield Heeley at the 2015 general election , as the youngest Labour member of that parliament .\nEarly life .\nHaigh grew up on Abbeydale Road , Sheffield , and now lives in Norfolk Park , Sheffield . She was educated at Sheffield High School , an independent school . She then studied Government and Economics at the London School of Economics but did not complete the course , and opted to study politics at the University of Nottingham . Her grandfather and uncle were trade union officials .\nAfter graduating , Haigh worked for the local council youth service between 2006 and 2008 . She then began working in Parliament , where she was the co-ordinator of the All Party Parliamentary Group on International Corporate Responsibility . During this time , she was also a Unite shop steward and volunteered as a Special Constable in the Metropolitan Special Constabulary between 2009 and 2011 .\nFrom 2012 , Haigh worked for Aviva as Public Policy Manager , responsible for corporate governance and responsible investment policy .\nPolitical career .\nMember of Parliament for Sheffield Heeley ( 2015–present ) .\nHaigh was selected to stand for the Labour Party in Sheffield Heeley in May 2014 . She was first elected to Parliament at the May 2015 general election and re-elected in June 2017 and December 2019 .\nHaigh was declared the most hard-working new MP in February 2016 after a study of the activity of MPs elected in 2015 .\nHaigh was instrumental in revealing that hundreds of women had their tax credits stopped in error by US company Concentrix . The revelation led to an announcement that their HMRC contract would not be renewed . Panic alarms have been installed in Haighs office and home by South Yorkshire Police after she received death threats for calling for a debate on the banning of Britain First , the far-right group . South Yorkshire Police have provided her with uniformed and undercover protection as she attends to her constituency activities .\nIn November 2016 Haigh introduced a Private Members’ Bill calling for statutory leave from work for living organ donors , after a constituent complained of being given three days’ unpaid holiday after donating bone marrow .\nIn April 2019 Haigh introduced a Private Members’ Bill that would remove the automatic parental rights of fathers of children conceived through rape . The Bill would also establish an inquiry into the family courts handling of domestic abuse and violence against women and girls . This Bill was borne out of Haighs work with Sammy Woodhouse , a survivor of child sexual exploitation , to increase protections for victims of abuse .\nHaigh is a member of a number of All-Party Parliamentary Groups , including the APPGs on Corporate Governance , Refugees , Colombia and Looked After Children . In July 2017 she was elected Vice Chair of the APPG on State Pension Inequality and in February 2019 became a Joint Chair of the APPG on Social Care .\nShadow Minister ( 2015–2020 ) .\nIn September 2015 , Haigh was appointed Shadow Minister for Civil Service and Digital Reform . The role , newly expanded under Jeremy Corbyn , covers the Governments digital strategy , the Freedom of Information Act , data security and privacy . In this role , Haigh criticised a 2016 reshuffle of Permanent Secretaries which saw two fewer women as departmental heads . She opposed the closure of the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills office in Sheffield city centre , saying the decision demonstrated contempt for the city .\nOn 10 October 2016 , she was made Shadow Minister for the Digital Economy . Haigh served in this role during the passage of the Digital Economy Act ( 2017 ) and introduced a number of amendments , including an obligation for television broadcasters to include subtitles and closed captioning in on-demand content online which was adopted by a subsequent Government amendment . She has repeatedly raised concerns about child protection online , including calling for social media companies to recognise that alongside their new-found power , they have responsibilities in dealing with harmful and illegal content .\nShe also called for compulsory online education alongside sex and relationships education in schools , citing an 800% increase in children contacting the NSPCC about online abuse .\nOn 3 July 2017 , she was made Shadow Policing Minister . Haigh has called for greater protection for police officers involved in vehicle pursuits , saying the current rules are hampering the ability of the police to apprehend very serious offenders . In this role she has raised the issue of stress and mental health of officers , citing a 77% rise in officer leave due to mental health between 2014 and 2018 . She has called for a public health approach to reducing violent crime and blamed the rise in crime on government spending cuts to both police and other public services .\nShadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ( 2020–present ) .\nOn 6 April 2020 , Haigh replaced Tony Lloyd as the interim Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , following Lloyds hospitalisation as a result of the COVID-19 virus . On 28 April 2020 , Lloyd resigned as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary to focus on recovery , and Haigh replaced him permanently . She is the second woman after Mo Mowlam to serve as the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland .\nHaigh made her first visit to Northern Ireland as Shadow Secretary of State in August 2020 .\nViews and policies .\nHaigh is concerned that forcing police to find more to pay for police pensions out of their general budget leaves less money for the police to protect the public . Haigh stated , Forcing the police at the last minute to bear the huge cost of pension changes demonstrates the utter failure of ministers to grasp the crisis in policing caused by their cuts . They have played fast and loose with public safety and the police are right to step up and take action .\nHaigh also feels it is wrong that the police are forced to deal with mental health crises that has been caused by underfunding of the NHS . Haigh said , “The government’s underfunding of mental health services is a national scandal and passing the buck to our overstretched police officers is exacerbating the crisis in policing . It is frankly shocking that the police are often the only people who someone experiencing a mental health crisis can turn to . Nearly a decade of brutal austerity has torn at the fabric of our society and the most vulnerable are being failed.”\nShe has spoken out about the crisis within the special education needs system . She has said , School funding cuts that have resulted in the loss of teaching assistants , a narrower curriculum , and bigger class sizes have all made certain mainstream schools more hostile environments for children with SEN .\nHaigh has also been outspoken in her opposition to fracking . She has said , I do not support fracking for a number of reasons : health and safety ; the potential for earth tremors ; the likely pollution of the water table ; the impact on local communities in terms of disruption and subsidence ; the fact that the chemicals used are deleterious to our health . Crucially , we also know that fracking contributes significantly to climate change and so , while all of the above means that fracking should absolutely not take place on an island as populated and as unconducive as ours , the evidence clearly shows that we should reject it outright .\nHaigh campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum .\nLabour leadership elections .\nHaigh was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015 , although she later said she regrets this decision . She supported and campaigned for Andy Burnham , however .\nIn the 2016 Labour leadership election , Haigh supported Owen Smith .\nIn the 2020 leadership election Haigh chaired the leadership campaign of Lisa Nandy . She also nominated Angela Rayner for Deputy .",

    "story": "Nino Burjanadze\nNino Burjanadze ( Georgian : ნინო ბურჯანაძე , also romanized Burdzhanadze or Burdjanadze , born 16 July 1964 ) is a Georgian politician and lawyer who served as Chairperson of the Parliament of Georgia from November 2001 to June 2008 . As the first woman she has served as the acting head of state of Georgia twice ; the first time from 23 November 2003 to 25 January 2004 in the wake of Eduard Shevardnadzes resignation during the Rose Revolution , and again from 25 November 2007 to 20 January 2008 , when Mikheil Saakashvili stepped down to rerun in the early presidential elections . She withdrew into opposition to Saakashvili as the leader of the Democratic Movement-United Georgia party in 2008 . In October 2013 , she ran in the presidential election , competing against 22 candidates . She ended third with 10 percent of the vote .\nEarly life and career .\nNino Burjanadze was born in Kutaisi , then-Soviet Georgia . She graduated in 1986 from the Faculty of Law of the Tbilisi State University ( TSU ) and afterwards pursued education at the Moscow State University from which she graduated with a doctorate in International Law in 1990 . In 1991 , she became a docent ( Associate Professor ) of the Faculty of International Law at the Tbilisi State University . At the same time , she worked as an expert-consultant in international law for the Parliament of Georgia and the Ministry for Environment Protection and Natural Resources .\nPolitical career .\nIn 1995 , Burjanadze was elected to the Parliament of Georgia for the Union of Citizens of Georgia ( UCG ) then chaired by the President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and supported financially by her father Anzor Burjanadze , a wealthy businessman . She first chaired the Parliamentary Committee for Constitutional Law from 1998 to 1999 , and the Parliamentary Committee for International Relations from 2000 to 2001 . During the years , she became known as a supporter of pro-Western values and proponent of Georgias integration with NATO and the European Union . She was closely allied with the reformist wing within the UCG led by Mikheil Saakashvili and Zurab Zhvania whom she succeeded on November 9 as the parliamentary chairperson after Zhvania resigned on November 1 , 2001 .\nAlthough she gave Shevardnadze strong support in his dealings with foreign countries ( in particular with Russia ) , she spoke out forcefully against the corruption and inefficiency of his governments domestic policy , declaring it to be absolutely incompetent . She left the UCG in 2002 , forming an opposition party called the Burjanadze-Democrats to fight the November 2003 parliamentary elections .\nAfter the rigged parliamentary elections of 2 November 2003 , she joined other opposition leaders in denouncing the election results and urging mass demonstrations against Shevardnadze . The terms of the Georgian constitution automatically made her the acting president when Shevardnadze resigned on 23 November . One of Burjanadzes first actions was to appeal for national unity and repeal the state of emergency declared by Shevardnadze , in an effort to restore stability to a country with a long history of political violence . She was an obvious candidate for the post , as she is widely respected by her compatriots - opinion polling in 2003 showed her to be one of s three most popular political figures .\nOn 4 January 2004 , Mikhail Saakashvili won the pre-term presidential elections in with an overwhelming majority . He was inaugurated on 25 January . A new was elected on 28 March , with Burjanadze resuming her old post as Speaker on 22 April .\nFollowing a political crisis in late 2007 , Saakashvili called new parliamentary and presidential elections for January 2008 . In order to contest the presidential election , Saakashvili announced his resignation effective 25 November 2007 , with Burjanadze becoming acting president for a second time ( until the election returned Saakashvili to office on 20 January 2008 ) .\nBurjanadze was designated to lead the United National Movement party list for the parliamentary elections scheduled on 21 May 2008 , but on 21 April she announced , in a surprise move , that she would not seek reelection due to a lack of consensus in the compilation of the National Movements party list . Burjanadzes term as a parliamentary chairperson expired with the new legislatures inaugural session on 7 June 2008 , when she was succeeded by David Bakradze .\nIn June 2008 , Burjanadze announced she would set up a think tank that would serve as a new form of being in politics . The organization — the Foundation for Democracy and Development ( FDD ) — was inaugurated in Tbilisi on 7 July 2008 .\nOn 27 October 2008 , in the aftermath of the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia , Burjanadze announced the establishment of a clear-cut opposition party called Democratic Movement–United Georgia .\nOn 28 November 2008 , in an interview with Russias Vesti news channel , Russias NATO envoy Dmitry Rogozin accused the United States of planning to replace Mikheil Saakashvili with Burjanadze as president of Georgia .\nOn March 23 , 2009 , the Georgian interior ministry confirmed , that 10 of the activists from Burdzhanadzes party , Democratic Movement–United Georgia had been arrested . Burdzhanadze accused Mikheil Saakashvili of arranging the arrests to intimidate the opposition . Burdzhanadze said the arrests marked the start of a punitive campaign by the government against the opposition , ahead of the mass protest planned for April 9 to demand Saakashvilis resignation .\n2011 protests .\nThe protests led by Burzhanadze began on May 21 , 2011 when over 10,000 Georgians attended a demonstration in Tbilisi demanding Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvilis resignation . In the southwestern town of Batumi some demonstrations also occurred with some protesters attempting to break into the television building . Nino Burjanadze has been a lead figure in the demonstrations . The protesters in Batumi briefly clashed with police . On 26 May at about 00:15 , Georgian police began to suppress the protests with tear gas and rubber bullets . The following year , the ruling party lost parliamentary elections .\nPolitical positions .\n- Burjanadzes position as it relates to Soviet symbols is that they should not be banned . According to her , it is because Georgian soldiers in the Red Army fought under Soviet symbols during World War II . Half the world fought against the Nazis with Soviet symbols . Instead of banning them , the state should concentrate on today’s problems and stop acting like fools Burjanadze stated in 2018 .\nPersonal life .\nBurjanadze is married to Badri Bitsadze , the former head of the Department of Georgian State Border Defence , who stood down shortly after Burdjanadzes political transformation . They have two sons . Aside from the Georgian language , she is fluent in the Russian and English languages .\nExternal links .\n- Nino Burjanadze ( official biography ) . Parliament of Georgia .",

    "story": "Günter Verheugen\nGünter Verheugen ( born 28 April 1944 ) is a German politician who served as European Commissioner for Enlargement from 1999 to 2004 , and then as European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry from 2004 to 2010 . He was also one of five vice presidents of the 27-member Barroso Commission ( Barroso I ) . After his retirement , he is now honorary Professor at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt ( Oder ) .\nEarly life and education .\nBorn at Bad Kreuznach in Rhineland-Palatinate , Verheugen studied history , sociology and political science at the University of Cologne and at the University of Bonn .\nCareer .\nPolitical career .\nVerheugen was Secretary General of the Free Democratic Party of Germany ( FDP ) from 1978 to 1982 , under the leadership of the partys chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher . He left the FDP with many left liberal party members in 1982 , because the FDP left the government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt . In the same year , he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) .\nMember of Parliament , 1983–1999 .\nIn the 1983 Western German elections , Verheugen became a member of the German Bundestag . He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1983 to 1998 . In the early 1980s , Verheugen mapped out a principled policy towards South Africas apartheid regime , embarrassing many of Germanys major companies , including Mercedes-Benz and Deutsche Bank , by exposing their efforts to get round international sanctions in a book published in 1986 .\nFrom 1994 to 1997 , Verheugen was deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary group , under the leadership of the groups chairman Rudolf Scharping . In addition to his parliamentary work , he chaired the Broadcasting Council of Deutsche Welle from 1994 until 1998 .\nAhead of the 1994 elections , Scharping included Verheugen in his shadow cabinet for the partys campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as Chancellor . Within Gerhard Schröders campaign team for the 1998 federal elections , he served as his external affairs advisor and accompanied him on his trips to Washington and Warsaw .\nMinister of State for European Affairs , 1998–1999 .\nIn the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , Verheugen briefly served as Minister of State in the Federal Foreign Office under Minister Joschka Fischer . During Germanys presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1999 , he led the negotiations on the Agenda 2000 package of EU policy reforms . Shortly after , he was in talks to be nominated as Germanys candidate for the European Unions newly created High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy ; the post eventually went to Javier Solana . In 1999 , he left parliament and became EU commissioner for Enlargement of the European Union .\nMember of the European Commission , 1999–2010 .\nNominated by the German government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , Verheugen first served in the European Commission as European Commissioner for Enlargement in the Prodi Commission , presiding over the accession of ten new member states in 2004 . He continued in the following Barroso Commission as Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry , also being promoted to one of the five vice presidents .\nOn the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty in 2003 , the EU Commissioners of Germany and France , Verheugen and Pascal Lamy , jointly presented the so-called Lamy-Verheugen Plan that proposed a factual unification of France and Germany in some important areas – including unified armed forces , combined embassies and a shared seat at the United Nations Security Council .\nAs a Commissioner , Verheugen stated a desire to cut red tape , especially in order to make it more favourable to SMEs . He also highlights research and innovation as twin keys to future competitiveness . He outlines his priorities as ; better regulation , a modern industrial policy , SMEs and innovation . In order to promote competitiveness , he laid down three policies derived from the treaties ; Competitiveness and improvement of the business environment ( Art . 157 ) . Completing and managing the Internal Market for products ( Art . 28 and 95 ) and Innovation and research framework programmes ( Title XVIII ) .\nVerheugen was heavily involved in work on the REACH directive and ensuring its compatibility with the Lisbon Strategy . He sees a common patent in the Union implemented by 2012 which he sees as important as patent application for the 24 million SMEs in Europe are on average 11 times higher than in the United States .\nIn response to the refusal of countries to sign the Kyoto protocol , such as the United States and Australia , Verheugen asked President Barroso to look into whether the EU could implement taxes on products imported from those countries not taking low-carbon policies on board ( Border Tax Adjustments ) .\nIn October 2006 , Verheugen accused European Union officials of being impossible to control , stating inter alia the purported impossibility of firing Directors-General ( the highest grade in the EU civil servants structure ) . However , Article 50 of the EUs Staff Regulations empowers the commission to do precisely that . Former civil servant Derk Jan Eppink described Verheugens position in the following terms :\nLife after politics .\nSince leaving public office , Verheugen has held a variety of paid or unpaid positions , including the following :\n- FleishmanHillard , Member of the International Advisory Board\n- German-Azerbaijani Forum , Member of the Board of Trustees\n- German Council on Foreign Relations ( DGAP ) , Member\n- Turkey : Culture of Change Initiative ( TCCI ) , Member of the Advisory Board\n- National Association of German Cooperative Banks ( BVR ) , Advisor ( since 2010 )\n- Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , Senior Advisor ( since 2010 )\nIn 2014 Verheugen was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universität Essen-Duisburgs NRW School of Governance .

Verheugen led the Agencys sectoral division for the institutional reforms recommendations aimed at the integration of Ukraine into the EU and civil society building .\nControversy .\nIn 2001 , former Czech Prime Minister Václav Klaus accused Verheugen of a tragic misuse of his position , after Verheugen warned that the countrys hope of joining the European Union swiftly would take a setback if the right-leaning Civic Democrats won the 2002 elections . On 5 November 2004 , during a press conference , Verheugen mentioned that the future prime-minister of Romania would be Mircea Geoană ( of the PSD ) and that Romania would end negotiations with the EU with just four days before the Romanian legislative and presidential elections . Following this , Romanian journalists accused him of meddling in Romanian politics .\nDuring his time in office , photographs appeared showing Verheugen holidaying with Petra Erler , the head of his private office . A Commission spokesman backed him by saying the private holidays of Vice President Verheugen in Lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the Commission . Despite this , there was a minor political row over Erlers appointment with allegations of her being appointed due to their friendship . These allegations were later aggravated over photos of them together on holiday holding hands , and then on a naturist beach together in Lithuania .\nPositions .\nOn cutting EU bureaucracy .\n- Many people still have this concept of Europe that the more rules you produce the more Europe you have .\n- ( October 2006 )\n- The idea is that the role of the commission is to keep the machinery running and the machinery is producing laws .

    "story": "Amalric of Jerusalem\nAmalric ( ; ; 113611 July 1174 ) was King of Jerusalem from 1163 , and Count of Jaffa and Ascalon before his accession . He was the second son of Melisende and Fulk of Jerusalem , and succeeded his older brother Baldwin III . During his reign , Jerusalem became more closely allied with the Byzantine Empire , and the two states launched an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt . Meanwhile , the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under Nur ad-Din and later Saladin . He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem , Sibylla , Baldwin IV , and Isabella I .\nOlder scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name , so these historians erroneously added numbers , making Amalric to be Amalric I ( 1163–74 ) and King Aimery ( 1197–1205 ) to be Amalric II . Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king . Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries .\nYouth .\nAmalric was born in 1136 to King Fulk , the former count of Anjou married to the heiress of the kingdom , Queen Melisende . After the death of Fulk in a hunting accident in 1143 , the throne passed jointly to Melisende and Amalrics older brother Baldwin III , who was still only 13 years old . Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later , and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other . In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king , and civil war broke out , with Melisende retaining Jerusalem while Baldwin held territory further north . Amalric , who had been given the County of Jaffa as an apanage when he reached the age of majority in 1151 , remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem , and when Baldwin invaded the south , Amalric was besieged in the Tower of David with his mother . Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter . In 1153 Baldwin captured the Egyptian fortress of Ascalon , which was then added to Amalrics fief of Jaffa ( see Battle of Ascalon ) .\nAmalric married Agnes of Courtenay in 1157 . Agnes , daughter of Joscelin II of Edessa , had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader County of Edessa were lost in 1150 . Patriarch Fulcher objected to the marriage on grounds of consanguinity , as the two shared a great-great-grandfather , Guy I of Montlhéry , and it seems that they waited until Fulchers death to marry . Agnes bore Amalric three children : Sibylla , the future Baldwin IV ( both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right ) , and Alix , who died in childhood .\nSuccession .\nBaldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric , although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes ; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir , but now the Haute Cour refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled . The hostility to Agnes , it must be admitted , may be exaggerated by the chronicler William of Tyre , whom she prevented from becoming Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem decades later , as well as from Williams continuators like Ernoul , who hints at a slight on her moral character : car telle nest que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem ( there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem ) . Nevertheless , consanguinity was enough for the opposition . Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife , although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fiefs income . Agnes soon thereafter married Hugh of Ibelin , to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric . The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession . Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years .\nConflicts with the Muslim states .\nDuring Baldwin IIIs reign , the County of Edessa , the first crusader state established during the First Crusade , was conquered by Zengi , the Turkic emir of Aleppo . Zengi united Aleppo , Mosul , and other cities of northern Syria , and intended to impose his control on Damascus in the south . The Second Crusade in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus , which soon fell to Zengis son Nur ad-Din . Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch . Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt , where the Fatimid dynasty was suffering from a series of young caliphs and civil wars . The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of Baldwin I , who died during an expedition there . The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible .\nInvasions of Egypt .\nAmalric led his first expedition into Egypt in 1163 , claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III . The vizier , Dirgham , had recently overthrown the vizier Shawar , and marched out to meet Amalric at Pelusium , but was defeated and forced to retreat to Bilbeis . The Egyptians then opened up the Nile dams and let the river flood , hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further . Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din , who sent his general Shirkuh to settle the dispute in 1164 . In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric , but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed . Shawar , however , feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself , and he too looked to Amalric for assistance . Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus .\nAmalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria , having taken Bohemund III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli prisoner at the Battle of Harim during Amalrics absence . Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemunds ransom in 1165 ( Raymond remained in captivity until 1173 ) . The year 1166 was relatively quiet , but Amalric sent envoys to the Byzantine Empire seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife , and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din , who captured Banias .\nIn 1167 , Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him , establishing a camp near Cairo ; Shawar again allied with Amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph al-Adid himself . Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the Nile . After an indecisive battle , Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh marched north to capture Alexandria ; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there , aided by a Pisan fleet from Jerusalem . Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric . However , Amalric could not remain there indefinitely , and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute .\nByzantine alliance .\nAfter his return to Jerusalem in 1167 , Amalric married Maria Comnena , a great-grandniece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus . The negotiations had taken two years , mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return Antioch to Jerusalem . Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in Tyre on August 29 , 1167 . During this time the queen dowager , Baldwin IIIs widow Theodora , eloped with her cousin Andronicus to Damascus , and Acre , which had been in her possession , reverted into the royal domain of Jerusalem . It was also around this time that William of Tyre was promoted to archdeacon of Tyre , and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom .\nIn 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt , and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to Constantinople to finalize the treaty . Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar , Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din , and Amalric invaded . The Knights Hospitaller eagerly supported this invasion , while the Knights Templar refused to have any part in it . In October , without waiting for any Byzantine assistance ( and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return ) , Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis . The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved . Amalric then marched to Cairo , where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold . Meanwhile , Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well , and upon his arrival Amalric retreated .\nRise of Saladin .\nIn January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated . Shirkuh became vizier , although he himself died in March , and was succeeded by his nephew Saladin . Amalric became alarmed and sent Frederick de la Roche , Archbishop of Tyre , to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe , but no assistance was forthcoming . Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived , and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged Damietta by sea and by land . The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp ; the Byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure , and a truce was signed with Saladin . Amalric returned home .\nNow Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies . In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of Eilat , severing Jerusalems connection with the Red Sea . Saladin , who was set up as Vizier of Egypt , was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph . Saladins rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem , as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal . Nevertheless , in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time , but again no help was received . Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by Saladin and Nur ad-Din , but also by the Assassins . In one episode , the Knights Templar murdered some Assassin envoys , leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars .\nDeath .\nNur ad-Din died in 1174 , upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias . On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from dysentery , which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem . William of Tyre explains that after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days , he ordered physicians of the Greek , Syrian , and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy . Neither they nor Latin doctors could help , and he died on July 11 , 1174 .\nMaria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters : Isabella , who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen , was born in 1172 ; and a stillborn child some time later . On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed Nablus to Maria and Isabella , both of whom would retire there . The leprous child Baldwin IV succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay ( now married to her fourth husband ) back to court .\nPhysical characteristics .\nWilliam was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail . He had a slight impediment in his speech , not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence . He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech . Like his brother Baldwin III , he was more of an academic than a warrior , who studied law and languages in his leisure time : He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact , he was second to no one in this respect . He was probably responsible for an assize making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour . Amalric had an enormous curiosity , and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning , during an illness , the resurrection of the body . He especially enjoyed reading and being read to , spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history . He did not enjoy games or spectacles , although he liked to hunt . He was trusting of his officials , perhaps too trusting , and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him , although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly .\nHe was tall and fairly handsome ; he had sparkling eyes of medium size ; his nose , like that of his brother , was becomingly aquiline ; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead . A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin . He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook . He did not overeat or drink to excess , but his corpulence grew in his later years , decreasing his interest in military operations ; according to William , he was excessively fat , with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist .\nAmalric was pious and attended mass every day , although he also is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women.. . Despite his piety he taxed the clergy , which they naturally opposed .\nAs William says , he was a man of wisdom and discretion , fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom . He is considered the last of the early kings of Jerusalem . Within a few years , Emperor Manuel died as well , and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east .\nSources .\n- Bernard Hamilton , Women in the Crusader States : The Queens of Jerusalem , in Medieval Women , edited by Derek Baker .

    "story": "Alphonsus J . Donlon\nAlphonsus J . Donlon ( October 30 , 1867 – September 3 , 1923 ) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who spent his career in priestly ministry and academia , including as president of Georgetown University from 1912 to 1918 . Born in Albany , New York , he garnered a reputation as a good student and an exceptional collegiate athlete . As a professor , he went on to lead Georgetown Universitys sports program , which enjoyed great success . As a result , he became known as the father of Georgetown athletics . He served as a professor of various sciences at Georgetown University and at Woodstock College , and as president of the former , he oversaw the removal of Georgetown Preparatory School from the university to a separate campus , and proposed the creation of the School of Foreign Service . For a significant portion of his career , he also served as a chaplain to Georgetown Visitation Monastery . In his later years , he engaged in pastoral work at St . Francis Xavier Church in New York City and taught at Fordham University .\nEarly life .\nAlphonsus Donlon was born on October 30 , 1867 , in Albany , New York , to father Patrick Donlon and mother Julia Howard Donlon , a native of Albany . His father emigrated to the United States from Ireland as a young boy with his mother and sister , while Alphonsus mother was a native of Albany , who died when he was eighteen months old . For this reason , Julias mother and her sister largely raised Alphonsus and his six siblings .\nEducation .\nHe first attended the parochial school at St . Marys Church , which was conducted out of the chapel of the Sisters of Charity . After receiving his First Communion , he enrolled at The Albany Academy , where he remained until the age of fifteen . In 1883 , he continued his education at Georgetown Preparatory School , and then at Georgetown College the following year . At college , he excelled in such sports as baseball , football , tennis , and track . During his freshman year , he made the first-string baseball team as a shortstop , and remained in this position for the duration of his time at Georgetown . Academically , he was likewise accomplished , receiving the Goff Philosophical Medal and the Medal for Mechanics . Here , he was known among his friends by the nickname Al . Donlon received his bachelors degree in 1888 and subsequently enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , where he studied electrical engineering . After his first year at MIT , he studied for the summer in Europe . Upon his return in 1889 , he decided to withdraw in order to pursue the priesthood .\nFormation and teaching .\nDonlon entered the Jesuit order on October 11 , 1889 . He proceeded to Frederick , Maryland , where he completed his novitiate in 1891 . That year , he began his two years of study of the classics in Frederick , and followed it with three years philosophy and science , which he completed in 1895 . Following his studies , he returned to Georgetown College in 1895 , where he assumed a teaching position in physics , mechanics , geology , and astronomy . It was during this time as a teacher that he gained the informal title of father of Georgetown athletics . As the faculty director of athletics , he coached all of Georgetowns teams , which went on to be highly successful .\nDonlon remained at Georgetown until 1900 , when he left for Woodstock College in Maryland to study theology . On June 28 , 1903 , he was ordained a priest by Cardinal James Gibbons at Woodstock College , and he completed his theological studies in 1904 . From there , he went to Poughkeepsie , New York , to fulfill his tertianship under Fr . Pardow , which lasted until 1905 . Donlon then returned again to Georgetown , where he resumed his teaching . In 1906 , he left again for Woodstock , where he taught physics until 1911 . On February 2 , 1907 , he attained gradus and professed his solemn vows to the Society of Jesus .\nGeorgetown University .\nOn October 10 , 1911 , Donlon was appointed the socius , or principal advisor , to the provincial superior of the Maryland Province of the Jesuits . After remaining in this position for more than a year , he was appointed the president of Georgetown University on January 23 , 1912 , succeeding Joseph J . Himmel . His style of leadership was one of ample delegation of responsibilities to subordinates and considerable deference to their judgment , some attributing it to his natural passivity and lack of any particular aptitude for the presidency .\nAmong his accomplishments as president was establishing a strong alumni association across the country . He also oversaw the unveiling of the statue of Bishop John Carroll in 1912 . Another of Donlons marks on Georgetown was his proposal to start a school of Political and Social Science , which would include a school of diplomacy and would be connected with Georgetown Law School . He presented his proposal to the Jesuit consultors on March 31 , 1913 , who approved ; he subsequently submitted his proposal to the Jesuit curia in Rome , but no action was taken . Though this proposal did not materialize until after his presidency , his proposition ultimately led to the creation of the School of Foreign Service . Donlon remained as president of Georgetown until May 1 , 1918 , when he requested provincial superior to relieve him of the office by a Jesuit with greater vitality . He was succeeded by John B . Creeden .\nGeorgetown Preparatory School .\nSeeing a need to separate the preparatory division from the division of higher education at Georgetown , Donlon also was responsible for the relocation of Georgetown Preparatory School to its campus in North Bethesda , Maryland . He led fundraising to permit the purchase of land in the Maryland countryside on which to build the school , and traveled the area to locate such a suitable property . Having secured the permission of the Jesuit provincial , the President and Directors of Georgetown College purchased . Construction of a new building was largely enabled by a donation by Class of 1869 alumnus Henry Walters . Though originally contributing $80,000 , Walters increased his anonymous donation to $130,000 when Donlon expressed his worry over the increasing cost of the project . On October 25 , 1916 , ground was broken on the new , Georgian Revival building , with Donlon in attendance and the Apostolic Delegate to the United States , Archbishop Giovanni Bonzano , ceremonially turning the first soil . Due to the outbreak of World War I , the building was not completed until 1919 .\nChaplain to Georgetown Visitation Monastery .\nIn 1905 , Donlon was appointed chaplain to the nuns at the nearby Georgetown Visitation Monaster , and held this position until his death . During his subsequent presidency of Georgetown , he ensured that the sisters of Georgetown Visitation Monastery receive degrees from Georgetown by opening a summer school for the sisters , staffed by some of the best teachers in the Maryland Province , which covered a broad range of subjects . Donlon regularly attended the sisters debates , musical performances , and dramatical performances , officiated at their celebrations , and led their students on retreats .\nWhen he was transferred to do pastoral work in New York , Donlon continued to work with the monastery . He would send promising students to the monastery , and led the community in a retreat in 1922 , which was said to have impressed many of the sisters .\nNew York .\nImmediately following his presidency of Georgetown , Donlon was slated to go to Boston as pastor of St . Marys Church . He is also recorded as teaching at Brooklyn College from 1918 to 1919 . He then served as a minister at St . Francis Xavier Church in Manhattan from 1919 to 1920 , where he was made the prefect of the church . He also served as the secretary of Xavier High School in 1920 . He then transitioned to pastoral work at the same church , which he did until 1923 .\nIn July 1923 , Donlon was appointed a professor of philosophy at Fordham University .\nDeath .\nDonlon was conducting a retreat at Manhattanville College in Tarrytown , New York , on August 31 , 1923 , when he suddenly suffered a heart attack at 11 a.m . while leaving the chapel . After consultation with a doctor , it was intended that he be brought to St . Vincents Hospital in New York City . However , at 11 p.m . on September 3 , 1923 , he died in the infirmary at Manhattanville . He was then buried in the Fordham University Cemetery .",

    "story": "Pierre Mauroy\nPierre Mauroy ( ; 5 July 1928 – 7 June 2013 ) was a French Socialist politician who was Prime Minister of France from 1981 to 1984 under President François Mitterrand . Mauroy also served as Mayor of Lille from 1973 to 2001 . At the time of his death Mauroy was the emeritus mayor of the city of Lille . He died from complications of lung cancer on 7 June 2013 at the age of 84 . He is the namesake of Lilles new stadium , Stade Pierre-Mauroy .\nBiography .\nBackground .\nMauroy was born in Cartignies . A teacher , he led the Socialist Youth Movement and the Technical Teaching Union in the 1950s . He became a leading figure in the Socialist federation of Nord département , which was among the third biggest of the French Section of the Workers International ( SFIO ) party and climbed quickly in the party . In 1966 , he became the second most powerful person of the party behind the secretary general , Guy Mollet . Nevertheless , when Mollet resigned as leader in 1969 , Alain Savary was chosen to succeed him .\nPolitical career .\nAfter the electoral disasters of 1968 and 1969 , he was persuaded of the necessity to renew the party . In 1971 , during the Epinay Congress , he supported François Mitterrands election to the party leadership and became the second most powerful person in the Socialist Party ( PS ) . Two years later , he was elected as a deputy and Mayor of Lille .\nIncreasingly , Mauroy criticized the replacement of former SFIO members from important positions by allies of Mitterrand . In this , he formed an alliance with Michel Rocard , the main opponent of Mitterrand , during the 1979 Metz Congress . However , Mitterrand chose him as spokesperson during the 1981 presidential campaign ; after Mitterrands election , he appointed Mauroy as Prime Minister .\nPrime Minister .\nMauroys government was a radical reforming one , implementing a wide range of social reforms including the reduction of the legal workweek from 40 to 39 hours , the limiting of continuous shift working to an average of no more than 35 hours per week , the lowering of the retirement age to 60 , and a rise in social welfare benefits . Entitlement to paid holidays was also extended from four to five weeks . During the Mauroy governments first year in office , minimum pensions were increased by 38% , rent allowances by 50% , family allowances by 25% ( 50% for households with two children ) , and the minimum wage by 25% .\nDuring the 1981–82 period , state industrial investment was substantially increased , 17 billion francs in ”soft loan credit was provided to private industry , 7 billion francs was set aside to help school leavers , 54,000 new civil service jobs were created , and a major housebuilding drive was launched . Efforts were made to shift the burden of direct taxes away from lower- income groups , while increases in the minimum wage gave the low paid a real increase in their living standards of about 15% in 1981–82 . Unemployment benefits were also increased , together with the duration of time in which one could receive them . In addition , the maximum allowable workweek was reduced from 50 to 48 hours .\nUpon taking office , the Mauroy Government embarked upon an ambitious redistributive programme . The minimum wage went up in real terms by 11% between May 1981 and September 1982 , while the minimum old age pension was increased by 30% . 800,000 elderly people were exempted from paying T.V . licenses , while 1.5 million were also exempted from local taxes . Between May 1981 and January 1983 , family benefits were significantly increased , with the purchasing power of the 2,700,000 families with two children raised by 40% . These policies significantly improved the living standards of the less well off in French society , with poverty reduced during Mauroys term in office . Family allowances were increased by 81% for families with two children and by 49% for families with three children , while old-age pensions were raised by 300 francs a month for a single person and 3,700 francs for a couple .\nAltogether , the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 45% in 1981 and by 7.6% in 1982 . Health care coverage was also extended , with health insurance benefits made more widely available to part-time employees and the unemployed . Efforts were also made to promote voluntary retirement at sixty , with a pension ranging upwards from 80% of the SMIC to 50% of a middle-management salary . In 1982 , two measures were introduced that extended eligibility for early retirement for workers aged 55 to 59 : the contrats de préretraites progressives and the contrats de solidarité-démission . These programmes were aimed at stimulating consumption and aggregate demand by providing firms with incentives to hire younger workers as replacements for early retirees . A year later , solidarity contracts were introduced which provided early retirement for older workers aged 55 or above on the condition that firms replace recipients with younger workers . Elderly people benefited greatly from the social and economic measures undertaken by the Mauroy Government , with the real income of pensioners rising by a quarter .\nHarsh immigration statutes introduced during the presidency of Valéry Giscard dEstaing were reversed , while an immigration law was passed ( 1981 ) to limit the grounds for expelling foreigners to facilitate family reunions and amnesty 130,000 illegal immigrants . A 1982 law introduced new rights for helper spouses , while the anti-discriminatory Professional Equality Law ( 1983 ) , which defined equality between men and women in sweeping terms , required all businesses to furnish statistics on the situation of women in the workplace . This legislation marked a new departure in anti-discriminatory efforts and , reinforced by a series of measures taken by the Rocard government in 1989 , brought an end to wage differentials hidden by different job descriptions . Decentralising laws were also passed which transferred responsibilities for urban planning to municipalities and economic planning to the regions . In addition , various measures were introduced to improve socio-economic conditions in low-income neighbourhoods . Aid for the improvement of older HLM housing was increased , with the allocation for 1982 being about 40% higher than in 1981 . A collaborative interministerial approach to employment and the social rehabilitation of at risk youth was adopted , and in 1983 the Banlieue 89 project was instigated for social and educational measures on estates in the educational priority areas . As a result of such policies , urban grants ( as a proportion of local authority revenues ) significantly increased during the first three years of the Mitterrand presidency , especially in municipalities controlled by the Left . In 1982 , the Missions locales pour l’insertion professionnelle et sociale des jeunes were established , local advice centres that targeted young people ( essentially in the 16-25 age group ) experiencing major difficulties in finding work . A military reform law , passed in July 1983 , enabled those who were opposed to the usage of arms on grounds of conscience to be accepted for civilian service .\nAn Ordinance of February 1982 limited the duration of fixed-term contracts to 6 to 12 months , and introduced an end of contract bonus of 5% total gross pay over the contracts period . Another Ordinance passed that same month restricted the duration of assignments to 6 months , and increased the precarious employment allowance from 4% to 15% of gross pay per assignment . For public sector workers , a law was passed in 1982 to prevent gender segregation in recruitment and to ensure that the situation was monitored carefully . An Act of July 1982 allowed the spouses of shopkeepers and artisans to receive social or work-related entitlements . An Act of August 1982 raised employers participation in financing the public transportation expenses of employees . In April 1982 special aids were extended to farmers who had invested between 1 April 1981 and 31 March 1982 .\nPursuant to its campaign pledges , the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts at the elementary and secondary levels in June 1981 , and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget . A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced . Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a priority area , with special attention in the form of more scholarship money , additional teaching positions , and the commitment of 430 million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme . However , these actions ( particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers positions in 1981 , when enrolment went up by 11,000 ) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship . In December 1981 , a general science programme in the eleventh grade ( premier ) was created to replace the mathematics programme ( the Bac C ) which , after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek , had come to be known as a royal road into élitist schools and careers . The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation , and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools . Greater funds were allocated to education , with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983 . In 1981–82 , as a means of tackling cases of education failure , the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the countrys 7,300 secondary schools . Although these subsidies were only of 30 million francs , the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem . They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones .\nIn 1981 , Educational Priority Zones were set up to provide additional resources to schools in depressed areas and to combat academic failure . The 1982 budget increased spending on education by 17% , while the 1983 budget provided tenure for 14,399 auxiliariat , teachers were only employed on a casual basis . A decree of June 1982 established a commission for public education staff training ( or MAFPEN ) in each académie , while CPR ( or regional teacher training centre , which were established in 1952 ) training placements were extended to 8–9 hours a week . That same year , the Delegation for Training and Research in Education was set up to coordinate the activities of the MAFPENs .\nThe outgoing centre-right government was perceived to have harassed university assistants , the most junior faculty rank , by publicly questioning their qualifications , by increasing the teaching load of those who had not completed doctoral theses , and by limiting prospects for promotion and tenure . In May 1982 , after several unions and associations announced a strike of assistants to call attention to their unmet grievances , the new education minister Alain Savary assured union leaders that all assistants who wished to continue a university career would be granted tenure . Promotion would be facilitated by the establishment of a thousand new maitre-assistant post per year for 4 years . In April 1982 , following several demonstrations and strikes by the National Associations of Assistants ( ANA ) , 2000 new tenured assistant positions were created .\nGovernment decrees of September and October 1982 introduced various reforms aimed at making entry to the National School of Administration ( or ENA ) more accessible to a wider range of French society . The age limit was raised to enable less favoured candidates to catch up on career advancement , the element in the entrance examination for general culture ( which had proven advantageous to upper-class applicants ) was reduced , students from other grandes ecoles were prevented from making claims that they were already civil servants when they applied to the National School of Administration , and a rule of parity between students and lower civil servants among candidates for admission to the ENA was established . In addition , a law of January 1983 introduced a third route of access to the National School of Administration , reserved for those who had held important posts in mutual aid societies , voluntary associations , and trade unions for a period of at least eight years , and extended this opportunity to certain local elected officials .\nThe Auroux laws ( 1982 ) increased the rights of trade unions and employees in the workplace , covering collective bargaining , representation , information , health and safety , and unfair dismissal . The Auroux Laws included a requirement that half of all overtime worked in excess of 130 hours per year must be compensated by additional time off , while trade union delegates became entitled to an increase in paid time off for union activities and to increased protection against dismissal . In addition , an Auroux Law of November 1982 established an obligation to negotiate real wages and hours once a year at the level of the firm , and to negotiate real wages once a year and to revise job classifications once every five years at the national industry level . Mandatory collective bargaining at the firm level of industry was introduced , while the laws also strengthened the rules on health and safety in the workplace , bestowing more rights upon the Comites d’hygiene et securite ( though not the right to stop production in case of extreme danger ) , while also granting working-class representatives release time , training for involvement in the comite d’entreprise and other representative bodies in the firm , recourse to expert consultants . Unions acquired rights to organise , to hold meetings in firms , and to call in outside speakers to address the workers . Worker representation on the comite d’rentreprise was increased and the comite was provided with additional powers , such as the right to obtain confidential economic information from the firm to use in advising it on policy . In spite of these positive changes , however , the comite dentreprise remained a consultative body with little influence on economic policy , while only large firms were required to provide their comite d’enterprises with economic information . This meant that almost two-thirds of the workers were excluded from exercising this oversight function .\nA government decree of March 1982 sought to provide greater employment security for the increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour ( this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers ) . The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded . That same year , the government passed legislation to ensure the full , legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion . In 1981 , legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations . In March 1982 , a Special Statute was granted to Corsica , which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural , social , economic , and educational policies . Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants . A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes , housing schemes , and the setting up of young peoples and womens groups , and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europes Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers . The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners for the first time to form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens , and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding . New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions , and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes . In 1982 , an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training , assistance to set up a small business and a repatriation grant .\nDecrees were made in January 1982 concerning official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring , the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces , and the inspection of electrical installations . A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction , operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations . A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery ( listed in a decree of April 1981 ) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved . It also specified the information to be provided by the person applying for official approval . A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up , restructuring , organization , financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required . Another decree , made that same month , contained new regulations governing health , safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings . It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met . It also contained provisions on training in the area , medical surveillance , and health and safety services . Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs . A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code , social security system , civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people . In June 1982 , a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced , under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 ( FF 20000 for households ) savings in that scheme . Also in 1982 , holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers ( Cheques-Vacances ) , subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings . A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts .\nAn Act of January 1984 asserted a right for all parents to benefit from a parental leave of absence for childrearing , providing that they have one years seniority . This legislation also allowed parents ( under the same conditions ) to request part-time work and to shift freely between part-time work and parental leave . In 1982 , the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity . For those with disabilities , a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures must be taken to accommodate the special needs of people with limited mobility . A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the work contract . The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant .\nVarious measures were also undertaken to encourage research . Higher spending was allocated to research , while the directors of the various research councils were changed and a series of regional colloquia set up , which culminated in a national assises of researchers , where some 3,000 met in Paris to establish guidelines for future research policy . A law was passed that allowed researchers in universities and agencies to sign contracts with industry . CESTA , an agency for evaluating new fields of science and technology , was established , while more money was allocate to ANVAR , the national agency for promoting the application of basic research .\nTo safeguard workers from exposure to dangerous substances and agents , three Orders containing\nthe lists and the conditions for the labelling and packaging of dangerous substances ( 10 October 1983 ) , of dangerous preparations solvents ( 11 October 1983 ) and of paints , varnishes , printing inks , glues and similar products ( 12 October 1983 ) gave effect to the corresponding EEC Directives under national legislation . A circular implementing these three Orders was issued in January 1984 and the substances and preparations not included in these orders were\ncovered by a circular on 4 July 1984 . A circular of July 1982 on maximum concentrations was supplemented by two others , dated December 1983 and May 1984 , with a view to the introduction of EEC Directive 80-1107 November 1980 on the protection of workers from exposure to chemical , physical and biological agents at work .\nA law on workers democracy in public-sector companies was passed in July 1983 which sought to recreate a spirit of tripartism in a sector of the economy where existing statutory rights had failed to provide anything more than a consultative role for representatives . Previously , workers had the right to be represented on the boards of public sector companies with 50 or more staff and were entitled to at least 2 board seats , but under the new legislation , public sector companies ( previously nationalized companies plus those companies that were nationalized in 1982 in which the state was the majority shareholder ) would be obliged to have tripartite administrative or supervisory boards to which employee representatives would be elected by the workforce . A couple of autogestionary measures were also introduced . One measure involved workers representation on the administrative councils of the nationalized industries , under which one-third of the members of these councils being drawn from the workforce . The other measure involved elections to the administrative commissions for social security , under which 15 and 25 members of these commissions were chosen through elections among those who were insured by the fund .\nA law on vocational training in February 1984 established employment contracts for six months for further training on the job while taking courses . These included the contrats de qualification , the contrats d’adaptation , ranging from 6 to 24 months , and a 3 to 6-month programme known as the stages d’initiation a la vie professionnelle , which was designed to familiarise young people with factory and firm . A 1983 law on apprenticeships laid down the principle that apprenticeship is a method of giving young workers having completed schooling a general theoretical and practical training , for the purpose of acquiring professional qualifications leading to technology diplomas . The law laid down a number of general rules on apprenticeship . Training is organised on the basis of alternation , part in industry , and part in the\napprenticeship centre , while a contractual relationship must be created between the apprentice and the employer , by means of an apprenticeship contract . A higher education law of 1983 restored democratic representation on university councils and granted the universities greater autonomy and more power to conduct research and to make contacts with industry .\nA decree of 23 March 1982 listed the offices responsible for testing lifting equipment other than lifts and building-site hoists , while a decree issued in May that same year 1982 extended its provisions to agriculture . Under a decree of 31 March 1982 , the general health and safety regulations for dangerous machinery and appliances were extended to include portable hand-operated machinery and appliances . Exceptions for certain less dangerous appliances were laid down in a decree of June 1982 . In regards to the agricultural sector , a decree of 8 March 1982 laid down the conditions attached to the approval of electrical installations in agricultural undertakings and specified which offices are authorized to test these installations . In 1983 , leave was introduced for setting up businesses and sabbatical leave for wage-earners , and in June that year , a law was passed that completed the incorporation into French Law of a 1977 European Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event of transfers of undertakings , businesses or parts of businesses .\nThe Deferre Law reduced the powers of the prefect , set up elected regional councils , and increased the powers of local government . The security court was abolished , and measures were introduced to control police harassment . Legal aid was extended , legislation was introduced which effectively combated discrimination against homosexuals , and the traditional powers of the juge d’instruction in the preparation of criminal cases was reduced . The Quillot Law of 1982 provided renters with additional rights in housing matters , while an audiovisual law passed that same year brought an end to the state monopoly of audiovisual broadcasting and established a High Authority to guarantee the independence of public television channels . Laws were passed in 1982 to reform higher education to make the academy more responsive to the needs of the state . High security wings in prisons were abolished , while social security reform increased workers representation on the bodies that oversaw the management of the social security schemes . In order to make the elite political academy ( the ENA ) accessible to a wider section of the population , a special entry pathway was established for those who had held trade union or political office . A new health care policy was implemented , which included the abolition of private beds in hospitals , reform of medical training , modernisation of facilities , and the election of the heads of medical services by the entire staff , rather than just by doctors , as had previously been the case . The Mauroy Government also withdrew a ministerial circular issued by the previous government that limited initiatives by regional councils , while a grant was created for the purpose of subsidizing local cultural projects and activities .\nThe Mauroy Government did much to promote arts , culture , and education , as characterised by a tripling in real terms in state aid to the arts , a quadrupling of spending on public libraries , which led to the number of library loans growing by a third , and the removal of obstacles to cheaper book-retailing . Aid was provided to provincial art museums and local archives for working-class affairs established , while funding to provincial libraries was significantly increased , with the national library budget going up from 163 million to 677 million francs . As a result of this additional library expenditure , 17 departments which had previously lacked a bibliothèque centrale de pret in 1981 had acquired one by 1986 . In addition , as a result of the Mauroy Governments library programme , 10 million more people obtained access to major lending library resources . As Paris share of the cultural budget fell from 60% to 45% between 1981 and 1985 , the provinces acquired new theatres , artistic centres , music halls , ballet companies , and popular culture facilities . During its first year in office , the Mauroy government increased spending on culture from 0.45% of the national budget to 0.75% , a figure which rose to 0.84% in 1984 .\nThe incomes of the poorest sections of society were increased exponentially as a result of social security reforms and a 25% increase in the minimum wage . Allowances for the handicapped were also increased , while the right to deduct the cost of child care for all children under the age of three was introduced ( a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases ) . Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees , hearing aids , and glasses was improved . An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated , and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward . Between 1981 and 1983 , the minimum vieillesse ( the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor ) was raised by 62% .\nTo assist young farmers , the role of the SAFER ( Societe dAmenagemcnt Foncier et dEtablissement Rural ) was extended in 1982 to give preferential aid to this group to enlarge their holdings . Various measures were also introduced that helped to boost farmers incomes . A partial price freeze instituted in June 1982 helped to limit the increase in production costs , while an income assistance programme ( introduced in 1982 to compensate for a decline in farmers incomes in 1981 ) contributed to a reduction in sectoral inequalities . In addition , an EEC price hike which the government negotiated in May 1982 represented an improvement over that of the previous year ( 11.2% compared with 10.3% ) . Consultative channels between farmers and government were also widened beyond the Federation Nationale des Syndicats dExploitants Agricoles ( or FNSEA , the chief farming syndicat ) . In addition , the Mauroy Government had helped in the establishment of 12,000 farms with young farmers by mid-1983 .\nFrom 1982 onwards , all self-employed women in France were provided with a lump-sum maternity grant which may be supplemented by an income-replacement allowance . In 1983 , the unemployment compensation programme was expanded to include workers who had resigned from their jobs . A law of July 1984 introduced a new benefit called the Insertion Allowance , providing short-term support for those in periods of transition into the labour market . Another law passed that same month introduced a Special Solidarity Allowance for long-term unemployed persons with no insurance entitlements remaining . In addition , an Act of October 1982 fully extended the right to join a union to people who were retired , and a law of February 1984 increased state support for the development and training activities of companies .\nAlthough the Mauroy governments social policies improved the living standards of the less well-off in French society , its reflationary economic strategy ( based on encouraging domestic consumption ) failed to improve the French economy in the long term , with increases in the level of inflation as well as in the trade and budget deficits . Although the governments reflationary policies tended to stabilise unemployment , the number of people out of work topped 2 million , in spite of a pledge made by Mitterrand to keep it below this figure . A large budget deficit emerged , with social benefits and aid to industry alone going up by 50% in the 1982 budget . In addition , private investment failed to respond to the governments initiatives , with a 12% decline in volume in 1981 . This led Mauroy to advocate the abandonment of Socialist economic policies ( which failed to reduce unemployment and inflation ) , a controversial U-turn which was ratified by President Mitterrand in March 1983 , and a number of austerity measures were carried out . In 1982 , housing allowances were decoupled from the cost-of-living adjustment index . In 1982 and 1983 , eligibility for unemployment benefits was tightened . A complex set of changes introduced in 1983 surrounding early retirement effectively reduced guarantees to full pensions for early retirees . Daily charges for hospital beds were introduced , while a variety of medical reimbursements were reduced . In September 1982 , the indexation of wages and salaries in the public sector was abolished .\nDuring the austerity period , the aim of the Socialists was limited to that of safeguarding the position of beneficiaries as far as possible and of giving special consideration to the poorest amongst them . While further increases in benefits for the elderly , the handicapped , and in some family allowances later became possible , extra costs were also imposed . For instance , the duration of unemployment benefits was reduced , while a basic hospital charge ( with exemptions ) was introduced , and contributions from the early retired and unemployed towards health care were demanded although , once again , the worse off were exempt . Austerity measures also led to efforts to restrain family costs while at the same time trying to safeguard priority groups . In February 1982 , a 25% increase was made in allowances for families containing two eligible children , but some benefits were abandoned and the starting and finishing dates for eligibility altered . Later , cash increases were less than the amounts necessary to maintain the real value of family benefits except for the poorest groups in French society . The limits on income assessed for social insurance contributions were raised and the income base upon which employers and the self-employed were assessed for contributions was changed . The cost of support for handicapped adults was transferred to the national government , although some taxation on tobacco and alcohol was also earmarked for this purpose . A 1% tax on personal incomes was imposed ( although the poorest 33% of taxpayers was excluded ) , and a 1% solidarity contribution levied on civil servants towards the cost of unemployment insurance . In spite of austerity , however , the real value of social protection made modest increases . Within the total , the greatest benefits was reserved for the poorest whilst income was raised in ways which saw a modest shift from traditional financing methods towards general community financing .\nFailing to restrict the financing of private schools via the Savary Law , he resigned in 1984 .\nAfter Matignon .\nIn 1988 he became First Secretary of the PS against the will of Mitterrand , who supported Laurent Fabius . Until the end of his term , in 1992 , he tried to appease the relations between the factions which composed the PS , notably during the very strained 1990 Rennes Congress . He allied with the rocardien group and Lionel Jospins supporters , who came from the mitterrandist group .\nPresident of the Socialist International from 1992 to 1999 , Senator since 1992 , he left the Lille mayoralty in 2001 . Considered a moral authority of the French Left , he supported the candidacy of Ségolène Royal during the 2007 primary election .\nPolitical career .\nGovernmental functions\nPrime minister : 1981–1984 .\nElectoral mandates\nEuropean Parliament\nMember of European Parliament : 1979–1980 ( Resignation ) .\nNational Assembly of France\nMember of the National Assembly of France for Nord ( French department ) ( 2nd , then 1st constituency from 1988 to 1992 ) : 1973–1981 ( Became Prime minister in 1981 ) / 1984–1992 ( Elected senator in 1992 ) .

    "story": "Glenn Hoddle\nGlenn Hoddle ( born 27 October 1957 ) is an English former football player and manager . He currently works as a television pundit and commentator for ITV Sport and BT Sport .\nHe played as a midfielder for Tottenham Hotspur , Monaco , Chelsea and Swindon Town and at international level for England . In 2007 , he was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame , which cited him as one of the most gifted and creative English footballers of his generation , exhibiting sublime balance and close control , unrivalled passing and vision and extraordinary shooting ability , both from open play and set pieces . He was also known for his tactical intelligence and work-rate .\nHe has been manager of Swindon Town ( earning promotion to the Premier League ) , Chelsea ( taking them to the FA Cup final ) , Southampton , Tottenham Hotspur ( reaching a League Cup final ) and Wolverhampton Wanderers . He managed England to the second round of the 1998 FIFA World Cup , where they lost to Argentina on penalties . He was dismissed from the England job in 1999 for a newspaper interview in which he was widely interpreted as saying that disabled people are affected by karma from past lives . He said that his words were misconstrued , misunderstood and misinterpreted and that disabled people had his overwhelming support , care , consideration and dedication .\nEarly life .\nHoddle was born on 27 October 1957 in Hayes , Middlesex to Derek Hoddle and Teresa Roberts . Soon after , the family moved to Harlow , Essex . He attended Burnt Mill School in Harlow . He has been supporting Tottenham Hotspur since he was eight , and his favourite player was Martin Chivers . He first came to the attention of Spurs when Chivers and Ray Evans went to present prizes at a local school cup final and noticed the potential of the 11-year-old schoolboy , and on Chivers recommendation he was invited to train with the club at Tottenhams practice ground in Cheshunt . At the age of 15 , Hoddle played for Harlow-based Sunday league club Longmans alongside his father . Hoddles uncle , Dave , was part of the Stansted team that won the 1984 FA Vase .\nPlaying career .\nTottenham Hotspur .\nHoddle joined the club as a junior when he was 12 , and signed for the club as an apprentice on 17 April 1974 . He successfully overcame knee problems in his early teens and collected eight England Youth caps , the first of these on 18 March 1975 against Spain . He made his Spurs first-team debut as a 17-year-old substitute for Cyril Knowles against Norwich City on 30 August 1975 , a game that ended 2–2 . Hoddle was forced to wait until 21 February 1976 to start a First Division match and immediately announced his arrival with the winning goal , a spectacular strike past Stoke City and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton .\nHe flourished under the management of Keith Burkinshaw and despite the clubs relegation to the Second Division in 1976–77 after 27 seasons of First Division football , a Hoddle-inspired Spurs side won promotion to the top flight at the first attempt . As Tottenhams transitional phase continued , Hoddles international career began on 15 December 1976 in an Under-21 friendly fixture against Wales . He would collect another eleven caps at that level , and play twice for the England B team prior to scoring on his full international debut against Bulgaria on 22 November 1979 .\nThe 1979–80 campaign heralded the emergence of Hoddle as a top-class player ; the 22-year-old midfielder scored 19 goals in 41 league appearances and was awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award at the end of the season . In 1981 , he starred as Spurs won the FA Cup for the sixth time , defeating Manchester City after a replay . In the following season Tottenham retained the FA Cup ( Hoddle scored in both the Final and Final replay ) against Queens Park Rangers and finished the League campaign in fourth place , the clubs best league position since 1971 . Hoddle performed as the midfield fulcrum in many of these successes and also contributed magnificently as the team reached the final of the League Cup , losing 3–1 to Liverpool , and the semi-final stage of the European Cup Winners Cup . During the summer of 1982 , Hoddle played in two of Englands matches in the opening group phase of the FIFA World Cup , starting against Kuwait after a substitute appearance in a 2–0 victory over Czechoslovakia .\nHoddles involvement in the following three seasons was limited by a number of niggling injury problems ( he started only 76 of a possible 126 league matches ) but nevertheless , Hoddle proved to be the architect behind the teams 1984 UEFA Cup triumph despite missing the Final due to fitness concerns . In October 1983 , he helped Spurs win 6–2 on aggregate against a Feyenoord Rotterdam side containing Johan Cruyff . Cruyff was dismissive of Hoddle before their first match , but after Hoddles performance , Cruyff swapped shirts with Hoddle as a sign of respect .\nSpurs came close to further honours in the next three seasons , reaching third place in the First Division and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1984–85 and another FA Cup Final in 1987 , losing 3–2 to Coventry City , the only time the North London club has experienced defeat in the final of the famous knock-out competition . The unexpected loss to the Midlands side was Hoddles last match for Spurs as newly appointed AS Monaco manager Arsène Wenger brought him to the principality for a fee of £750,000 . Between 1975 and 1987 , the gifted playmaker scored 110 goals in 490 first-team matches in all competitions , only four players ( Steve Perryman , Pat Jennings , Gary Mabbutt and Cyril Knowles ) have made more appearances in a Spurs shirt . At international level , Hoddle won 44 caps for England during his Tottenham career .\nAS Monaco .\nHoddle announced in 1987 that he would be leaving Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the season to pursue a career overseas where his style of play would be appreciated by continental managers and supporters , and to play European level football with English clubs banned after the Heysel disaster . He joined AS Monaco alongside George Weah and fellow Englishman Mark Hateley and immediately inspired the club to the 1988 Ligue 1 championship , its first league title in six seasons . Hoddle was voted the Best Foreign Player in French football and helped to guide the team to the quarter-finals of the European Cup in the 1988–89 campaign . Arsène Wenger , later the manager of Arsenal , was the coach who brought him to Monaco . However , a severe knee injury curtailed Hoddles career at the highest level and in November 1990 , the 33-year-old left the club by mutual consent , having helped to improve the standing of English footballers in foreign countries .\nDuring his three and a half-year spell in France , Hoddle won a further nine England caps , making his international farewell against the Soviet Union in June 1988 . He returned to England and signed for Chelsea on a non-contract basis to regain his fitness , leaving Stamford Bridge in March 1991 without playing a senior match to become player-manager of Swindon Town in the Second Division .\nEngland international career .\nHoddle made his debut alongside Kevin Reeves in Englands Euro 80 qualifying tie against Bulgaria on 22 November 1979 , scoring in a 2–0 win at Wembley . He scored in his third appearance against Australia on 31 May 1980 in a friendly in Sydney . His third goal came in his fifth appearance on 25 March 1981 in a game against Spain at Wembley , which England lost 2–1 . He reached the 10-cap point of his career on 27 April 1982 in the British Home Championship clash with Wales in Cardiff , which England won 1–0 . By this stage of his international career he had scored four goals .\nHe was included in the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup squads , and England reached the quarter-finals against Argentina in the latter .\nHoddle also featured prominently in the European Championship squads of 1980 and 1988 , making his 53rd and final international appearance in the final group game of Euro 88 , in a 3–1 defeat to the Soviet Union in West Germany . He had scored eight goals for the England senior side in a career stretching nine years , the last of his international goals coming on 23 April 1986 in a 2–1 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley .\nManagerial career .\nSwindon Town .\nWhen Hoddle arrived at Swindon in March 1991 , the club was struggling in the aftermath of a financial scandal which had seen them stripped of promotion to the First Division at the end of the previous season , a controversy which had negatively impacted the teams league form as they had been forced to sell several key players including midfielder Alan McLoughlin .\nHoddle prevented Swindon from slipping into the Third Division and further improvement throughout the 1991–92 season saw the Wiltshire club finish in eighth place , just missing out on a play-off place . They had briefly led the table in October .\nSwindon reached the playoffs of the rebranded Division One in 1993 and beat Leicester City 4–3 at Wembley , and were then promoted to the Premier League . Hoddle scored Swindons first goal of the final .\nBy the time he guided Swindon to promotion , Hoddle was already been linked with managerial vacancies at bigger clubs . Just days after guiding Swindon to promotion , he accepted the offer to manage Chelsea and was succeeded at Swindon by his assistant John Gorman , who had been widely expected to follow him to Stamford Bridge .\nChelsea .\nIn June 1993 , Hoddle became player-manager of Chelsea . His assistant at Chelsea was the former Tottenham manager Peter Shreeves , and they reached the FA Cup final in Hoddles first season , where they lost 4–0 to Manchester United . But United had done the double , and consolation for their failure to win the trophy came in the form of a European Cup Winners Cup place - Chelseas first European campaign for more than 20 years . Chelsea finished 14th in the league that season , memorably managing to inflict two of just four league defeats on the double winners that season , winning 1–0 at Stamford Bridge in September and 1–0 at Old Trafford in March , with Gavin Peacock scoring both times .\nChelsea reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners competition in 1994–95 and lost by a single goal to Real Zaragoza , who went on to beat Arsenal in the final . Hoddle guided Chelsea to the FA Cup Semi-finals in 1995–96 , but was unable to take them beyond 11th place in the Premiership – they had occupied this final position three times in four years . He did establish them as a force in cup competitions and made them capable of attracting top-class players – such as Ruud Gullit – to the club . Other notable signings were Mark Hughes , Dan Petrescu , Gavin Peacock , David Rocastle and Mark Stein .\nEngland .\nHoddles three-year reign at Chelsea came to an end in the summer of 1996 , after he had accepted the offer to manage the England national football team in place of Terry Venables after Englands Euro 96 campaign , where they finished as semi-finalists as the host nation . He guided England to qualification for the 1998 World Cup , securing the teams automatic qualification with a 0–0 draw in Rome against Italy . He later caused controversy by omitting Paul Gascoigne from the squad and installing supposed faith healer Eileen Drewery as part of the England coaching staff , which led to the team being dubbed The Hod Squad . They reached the second round of the 1998 tournament , losing on penalties to Argentina . Hoddle came under criticism after a disappointing start to the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign , leading to speculation that he would be sacked - particularly if England failed to qualify .\nHowever , Hoddles 60% win rate during his spell as manager is only bettered by Sir Alf Ramsey , Fabio Capello and Sam Allardyce .\nDismissal from England job .\nOn 30 January 1999 , with the England team preparing for Euro 2000 , and amidst the fall-out from the previous seasons World Cup , Hoddle gave an interview to Matt Dickinson of The Times newspaper in an attempt to defend himself against his critics ( over issues such as Eileen Drewery and his ideology . ) and show a strong front for the remainder of the qualifiers .\nDickinsons interview reported that Hoddle had a controversial belief that the disabled , and others , are being punished for sins in a former life . Hoddles comments were criticised by several politicians including Sports Minister Tony Banks and Prime Minister Tony Blair . Public opinion , based upon the immediate media furore resulted in ( according to one BBC poll ) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as England manager . The BBC survey showed that many considered his comments insensitive to disabled people , but others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to sack him would constitute religious discrimination .\nHoddle said that he was unwilling to resign . He stated his words were misinterpreted and pointed out his contributions and commitment to organisations helping disabled people . The Football Association terminated Hoddles contract on 2 February 1999 , which was welcomed by representatives of disabled groups . The disabled rights campaigner Lord Ashley however , while criticising Hoddles views , defended his right to express them , likening the campaign against Hoddle to a witchhunt and considered Hoddles dismissal a sad day for British tolerance and freedom of speech Some writers considered the remarks were used as a pretext to get rid of him . Hoddle apologised for the offence that had been caused , stating it had never been his intention and continued to fundraise for disabled groups after being dismissed .\nSouthampton .\nHoddle was back in football within a year as Southampton manager , succeeding Dave Jones , who had been suspended to concentrate on clearing his name in connection with child abuse charges . Although these allegations were later found to be false , Jones was not reinstated and Hoddle continued as Southamptons manager , having arrived on the South Coast in January 2000 . Hoddle kept the Saints in the Premier League with a 15th-place finish , but left in March 2001 to return to Tottenham as manager . Southampton were on course for a 10th-place finish – their highest since 1995 – when Hoddle left .\nTottenham Hotspur .\nHoddle was appointed manager of Tottenham in March 2001 with John Gorman as his assistant , following the sacking of George Graham . His first match in charge was the FA Cup semi-final against north London rivals Arsenal which Spurs lost 2–1 . The following year , Tottenham reached the League Cup final in February 2002 ; after winning 5–1 against Hoddles former club Chelsea in the semi-final second leg , Spurs were the favourites but they lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers . The clubs promising early season form ( which saw Hoddle voted Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2001 ) dwindled away and they finished ninth in the Premiership .\nSpurs began the 2002–03 season in fine form and Hoddle was named Premiership Manager of the Month for August 2002 after they ended the month top of the league . They finished in a disappointing 10th place at the end of the season . The pressure began to build up on Hoddle and he was sacked in September 2003 after a slow start to the season , in which the team picked up just four points from their opening six league games . His final game in charge was a 3–1 loss to his former side Southampton .\nWolverhampton Wanderers .\nHoddle was linked with a return to Southampton in March 2004 , but opposition from supporters meant chairman Rupert Lowe pursued alternative targets and ultimately selected Paul Sturrock instead . Instead he returned to management on 7 December 2004 with Wolverhampton Wanderers , again succeeding Dave Jones . Wolves lost only one of their remaining 25 games but failed to reach the play-offs because 15 of those games had been draws . In the 2005–06 season , drawing too many games again cost Wolves a top-six finish , with the club drawing 19 of their 46 league games . Wolves finished seventh , eight points off the playoffs . Wolves fans turned against Hoddle and there were chants against him during the last home game of the season against Watford . The board kept faith with Hoddle , but he stepped down on 1 July 2006 , stating differing expectations between himself and the club as the reason for his departure . In his time with Wolverhampton Wanderers , the club drew 34 league games in his 76 games in charge , spanning over two seasons .\nFootball academy .\nBy January 2008 , Hoddle was attempting to raise the capital to form the Glenn Hoddle Academy based in Spain . The aim of the academy is to give another chance to young players released by football clubs in England to become professional players . Ikechi Anya was his first player at the academy to get a professional contract at a club , with Sevilla Atlético in Spain .\nIn June 2011 , it was announced that The Glenn Hoddle Academy had linked up with English Conference North side Hyde . The Academy had previously enjoyed a link with the Spanish fourth-tier side Jerez Industrial , providing their entire squad and coaches , but fell out in a dispute over cash .\nManagement offers .\nHoddle said in December 2013 that he been offered a chance to return to management no less than 26 times in seven years , but commented that he would not return to management until his academy was able to run itself .\nIn April 2014 he said he had come close to taking over from André Villas-Boas at Tottenham , before the job was given to Tim Sherwood . I did have talks with Daniel Levy and the club , Hoddle said . He wanted a little bit of advice and a bit of a sounding board for himself . [ I said ] I am there for you if you want me to take it to the end of the season and then we will have a little look at it then , I would be prepared to do that . I wouldnt do it for any other club for that short period of time . It was just that it is in my DNA . I have loved my time at other clubs , I really have , but being a Spurs supporter since I was eight , going there very young , it is in my blood .\nIn August 2014 , Hoddle was appointed first team coach at Queens Park Rangers under Harry Redknapp . However , on 3 February 2015 , Redknapp resigned , following which Hoddle also left the club .\nIn June 2016 , after Englands 2–1 loss to Iceland at Euro 2016 and manager Roy Hodgsons subsequent resignation , Harry Redknapp and Alan Shearer both put forward Hoddle as a candidate for the job before Sam Allardyce was appointed .\nMedia career .\nHoddle has done punditry work since his retirement from coaching . He has worked for ESPN , ITV Sport and BT Sport . Hoddle began working with ESPN during Euro 2012 as a pundit . Since then , he has worked with ITV for the 2014 FIFA World Cup , Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup . He also does punditry and co-commentary for BT Sport on their telecasts of the Premier League , FA Cup , Champions League and Europa League .\nSinging career .\nIn May 1987 , Hoddle released the pop single Diamond Lights , which reached number 12 in the UK Singles Chart . It was a duet with his Spurs and England teammate Chris Waddle . The pairs follow up single Its Goodbye only managed to reach 92 in the British charts .\nIn 2021 , Hoddle appeared as a contestant on the second series of the British version of The Masked Singer , masked as the Grandfather Clock . He finished in 9th place .\nPersonal life .\nIn 1986 , while on holiday in Israel , Hoddle said that he had an experience which led him to become a born-again Christian .\nHoddle has been married twice , firstly to Christine Ann Stirling ( 1979–1998 ) and subsequently to Vanessa Colburn ( 2000–2015 ) . He has three children with his first wife ( Zara , Jamie and Zoe ) .\nIn 1996 , his younger brother , former footballer Carl Hoddle , overdosed on paracetamol , but recovered . In March 2008 , Carl Hoddle died at the age of 40 after collapsing suddenly from a brain aneurysm . Glenn Hoddle was reportedly devastated by the death of his brother .\nOn 27 October 2018 , his 61st birthday , Hoddle suffered a cardiac arrest in a London TV studio and was taken to hospital for emergency heart surgery . The Guardian reported that he had been close to death and was saved by the actions of an employee at BT Sport , Simon Daniels , who knew how to use a defibrillator . On 23 November 2018 , Hoddle left St Bartholomews Hospital to recuperate at home after his hospital treatment .\nIn March 2021 , Hoddle said he was devastated when he heard the news that Glenn Roeder had died aged 65 , describing him as a lovely guy and a really good coach . Roeder worked as a coach under Hoddle during his time as England manager .\nHonours .\nSource :\nPlayer .\nTottenham Hotspur\n- FA Cup : 1980–81 , 1981–82\n- FA Charity Shield : 1981 ( shared )\n- UEFA Cup : 1983–84\nAS Monaco\n- Division 1 : 1987–88\nIndividual\n- PFA Young Player of the Year : 1979–80\n- PFA Second Division Team of the Year : 1977–78\n- PFA First Division Team of the Year : 1979–80 , 1981–82 , 1983–84 , 1985–86 , 1986–87\n- PFA Team of the Century ( 1977–1996 ) : 2007\n- Division 1 Foreign Player of the Year : 1987–88\n- English Football Hall of Fame Inductee : 2007\nPlayer Manager .\nSwindon Town\n- Football League First Division play-offs : 1993\nChelsea\n- FA Cup runner-up : 1993–94\nManager .\nTottenham Hotspur\n- Football League Cup runner-up : 2001–02\nIndividual\n- Premier League Manager of the Month : October 2001 , August 2002\nExternal links .\n- Hoddle quotes\n- Hoddles football academy\n- Glenn Hoddle Collection at the National Football Collection\n- Stats at neilbrown.com\n- The Telegraph Glenn Hoddle Factfile .",

    "story": "Bianca Maria Sforza\nBianca Maria Sforza ( 5 April 1472 – 31 December 1510 ) was the queen of Germany and empress of the Holy Roman Empire as the third spouse of Maximilian I . She was the eldest legitimate daughter of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan by his second wife , Bona of Savoy .\nEarly life .\nBianca was born in Pavia as the eldest daughter of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan , by his second wife , Bona of Savoy . She was named after her paternal grandmother , Bianca Maria Visconti . When Bianca was not yet five years old , her father was assassinated inside the Church of Santo Stefano in Milan on 26 December 1476 , which was the Feast Day of St . Stephen . He was stabbed to death by three high-ranking officials of the Milanese court .\nOn 6 January 1474 the 21-month-old Bianca married her first cousin Duke Philibert I of Savoy , the son of her uncle Amadeus IX of Savoy , and Yolande of France . Duke Philibert I died in the spring of 1482 , leaving Bianca a widow at the age of ten . She returned to Milan , under the tutelage of her uncle Ludovico Il Moro , who cared little about her education and allowed her to indulge her own interests , mainly needlework .\nOn 31 July 1485 , the engagement between Bianca and John Corvinus , the only ( though illegitimate ) son of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary , was formally announced . With this marriage , the Hungarian ruler wanted to secure his sons future inheritance of Hungary and Bohemia and to make him Duke of Austria . The marriage by proxy was signed on 25 November 1487 , and according to the terms of the contract , Bianca received several Hungarian counties . However , due to the opposition and intrigues of Queen Beatrix , wife of King Matthias , the formal marriage never took place . In March 1492 a marriage between Bianca and King James IV of Scotland was considered , but the idea was soon abandoned .\nQueen and empress .\nOn 16 March 1494 in Hall , Tyrol , Bianca married her second husband , the widowed King Maximilian I of Germany . Biancas second marriage was arranged by her uncle , who wanted recognition and the title of duke confirmed by Maximilian ; in exchange , Maximilian received a large dowry along with Bianca , 400,000 ducats . Her magnificent retinue on her way to her wedding aroused much attention . At her wedding , Bianca wore a bodice with eighty pieces of the jewelers art pinned thereon , with each piece consisting of one ruby and four pearls . Maximilians claim to overlordship of Milan angered Anne of France , regent for her brother King Charles VIII of France , and brought about French intervention in Italy , thus inaugurating the lengthy Italian Wars .\nThe union was unhappy : shortly after the consummation of the marriage , Maximilian complained that Bianca may have been more beautiful than his first wife , Duchess Mary of Burgundy , but was not as wise . It was impossible for the young bride to win the affection of her husband , who considered her too uneducated , talkative , naive , wasteful with money , and careless . He did wish to have children with her , but all their attempts failed : despite Biancas several pregnancies , none produced a living child . She very much liked her stepchildren Philip the Handsome and Margaret , but was criticized for forgetting her dignity when she sat on the floor with them to play .\nAfter 1500 , Maximilian lost all interest in Bianca . She lived with her own court of Milanese people in various castles in Tyrol . On several occasions he left her behind as security when he could not pay for his rooms on trips . Maximilian took the title of emperor-elect of the Holy Roman Empire in 1508 , making Bianca empress . Empress Bianca died at Innsbruck on 31 December 1510 . She was buried at Stams . Her husband did not attend her funeral or even dedicate a gravestone to her .\nReferences and literature .\n- Hellmut Andics : Die Frauen der Habsburger. .

He finished the season 4th with 227 points .\nSainz also competed in the UK Formula Renault Winter Cup , finishing 6th in the first race and retiring from the second race at Snetterton .\nFormula Three .\nDuring the 2012 season , Sainz raced in both British and Euro Series Formula 3 championships . Racing for Carlin , he won four races , finished nine times on the podium , as well as scoring a pole position in the British championship , finishing sixth overall in the final championship standings . He scored two podiums and two pole positions in the Euro Series championship , finishing in ninth position overall .\nGP3 .\nIn 2013 , Sainz signed with Arden to compete in the GP3 series . Most Red Bull Racing Juniors race for Arden as it is co-owned by Red Bull boss Christian Horner and driver Mark Webber . His first race weekend in the series did not go as expected . During the first qualifying session of the year , he managed to qualify in 5th place and was only 5 tenths off pole sitter Kevin Korjus . However he , as well as Alex Fontana and Patrick Kujala , were penalised 10 places for ignoring yellow flags during free practice . During the beginning of race one , Sainz managed to get up to 13th place by passing Alex Fontana and Jimmy Eriksson off the start . By the start of lap 3 , he was already 13 seconds behind the leader , however , this was due to him being stuck in traffic . Sainz had made it all the way up to 8th place with his teammate Daniil Kvyat until both cars lacked grip . Because they were both pushing to get into the top ten for points , neither driver decided to manage their Pirelli tryes and so by the end of the race , Kvyat was 20th and Sainz managed to get 15th place and so effectively he never gained or lost any positions . However , worryingly for him , he finished 51 seconds off first placed man Tio Ellinas . Sainz started in 15th place for race 2 on Sunday morning . At the end of lap 1 , he managed to gain 6 places to find himself in 9th place . As they approached lap 2 , the safety car was deployed due to an accident behind , giving Sainz time to save his tyres . With 5 laps remaining , Sainz was up to 8th place . During the next lap , he managed to put a move on Jack Harveys ART car to move up into 7th place . Sainz eventually would finish in 7th place . However , post race investigating revealed the Sainzs car was underweight , and so he was disqualified from the final results from race 2 , thus scoring no points during what was a difficult weekend for not only Sainz , but for his teammate , Kvyat , who retired during the race due to contact with another driver .\nIn Valencia , Sainz began , and finished , the race in 8th place . In race 2 , he started in 4th place and managed to get up into 3rd place by the end of lap 1 . He remained in that position , scoring a podium for the first time in GP3 . Before the weekend , Sainz had not tallied any championship points . By the time the weekend was over , Sainz had managed to obtain 24 world championship points , 4 for fastest laps in both races . He was now in 6th place in the championship and was looking healthy in the title fight .\nIt was another bad weekend for Sainz at Silverstone , as in both races he got poor results . During the first race , Sainz was squeezed off track , falling to 9th place . By mid distance , it was all looking good and it looked even better when he managed to overtake Lewis Williamson to get into 8th place . Williamson then moved alongside Sainz to try and overtake but Sainz kept moving over towards him until there was contact . Williamson was sent into a spin whilst Sainz continued to circulate round the track . Due to the damage to his car , Sainz fell down the order until he crossed the finish line in 13th place . In race 2 , he finished where he started , in 13th place .\nFormula Renault 3.5 .\nSainz raced in Formula Renault 3.5 for the first time in 2013 . However , because he was more focused on GP3 at the time he missed several races in his first season . In Monaco he was 6th was after a difficult start to his GP3 season . He had a double retirement in Spa . He missed the Moscow and Austria races but returned at Hungary to take 7th place in Race 1 but 22nd in race 2 after a few problems . In France , at the Circuit de Paul Ricard he had another double retirement . In the last race weekend of the year in Catulunya , he retired in race 1 but managed to score 6th place .\nIn 2014 , he switched teams to DAMS . In the season opener at Monza he finished 18th in the first race but won the second . He left Monza with 25 points , beating his previous seasons score by 3 points . Another win at Aragon meant he doubled his score and in race 2 , he finished in 4th . Another 4th place followed at the one race in Monaco . The weekend at Spa followed with another 2 wins . Moscow followed and he did not perform well . 14th and 6th meant that he only took 8 points from a possible 50 . At the Nurburgring Gp Circuit , he won race 1 but in race 2 , he retired . In Hungary , he was no match for Roberto Merhi who led by half a minute from the rest of the field in the wet . Another 6th place followed in race 2 . In France , he won and scored a total of 50 points to extend his championship lead over Merhi .\nFormula One .\nTest Driver for Toro Rosso and Red Bull ( 2013 ) .\nIn 2013 , Sainz also announced as a test driver for both Red Bull and Toro Rosso for as part of the Young Drivers Test at Silverstone .\nToro Rosso ( 2015–2017 ) .\n- 2015 season\nSainz drove for Scuderia Toro Rosso in the season where he partnered Max Verstappen at Toro Rosso , in 2015 , following Daniil Kvyats promotion to Red Bull . Sainz selected 55 as his race number . He qualified inside the top ten for his début , at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix , and finished the race in ninth position . In the third free practice session of the 2015 Russian Grand Prix , Sainz lost control of his car going into turn 13 of the Sochi Autodrom , hit a wall and went on to crash into the Tecpro barriers .

He later had a streak of no points until the United States Grand Prix , where he finished in 6th place , he did not score any points at the Mexican Grand Prix , got another 6th place at the Brazilian Grand Prix and no points at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . At the end of the season , he finished 12th in the driver standings with a total of 46 points .\n- 2017 season\nSainz started off the season with 7th in Australia . In China , he made the boldest move in the field to be the only one on the dry tyres . It worked and he finished 8th . He did not finish in Bahrain after colliding with Lance Stroll when he was coming out of the pits which resulted in a three place grid penalty at the next race , the Russian Grand Prix , where he went on to finish 10th . In Spain , he once again finished 7th before his current season best with 6th place in Monaco by holding off Lewis Hamilton . He did not finish in Canada , where he was involved in a first lap clash with Romain Grosjean which took out Felipe Massa .

He retired from the Japanese Grand Prix as well , after a crash .\nRenault ( 2017–2018 ) .\nSainz moved to Renault beginning with the 2017 United States Grand Prix where he replaced Jolyon Palmer and partnered Nico Hülkenberg at Renault , with Kvyat returning to Toro Rosso to take his old place . In his first race for Renault , Sainz finished the race in 7th and outqualified Nico Hülkenberg , a feat Jolyon Palmer failed to do throughout the year , although it meant very little as Hülkenberg opted not to post a lap time in Q2 due to his impending grid penalties . A less impressive performance followed at the next race in Mexico . He qualified 9th , three and a half tenths down on Hülkenberg in 8th , and started the race in 7th following Ricciardos engine penalties . After the first lap , he found himself in 5th place , behind Hülkenberg , after championship contenders Vettel and Hamilton collided at the start of the race . However , Sainz spun in the high speed section of the track and flat-spotted his tyres and was forced to pit and came out in 19th place , with only the damaged and delayed Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton behind . He would remain at the tail-end of the field until he retired from the race with steering problems . He would not finish in the points for the rest of the season .\nHe finished the season in 9th place , a career-high , with his points total combined from his time at Toro Rosso and Renault .\n- 2018 season\nSainz had a positive start to the season scoring in five of the first six races but he finished behind his teammate Nico Hülkenberg in each of the four races they both finished . In Azerbaijan Sainz finished in a season high position of fifth . He would finish the season in tenth place on 53 points , 3 places and 16 points behind teammate Hülkenberg scoring points in 13 races out of the 19 races he finished .\nMcLaren ( 2019–2020 ) .\n- 2019 season\nSainz moved to McLaren for the season , replacing Fernando Alonso , who had retired following the season and partnering Lando Norris . After an unlucky pointless start to the season due to reliability issues at the and being involved in collisions at the Bahrain and Chinese Grands Prix , Sainz consistently scored points thereafter , often finishing strongly as the best of the rest behind the top three teams . He fought for sixth place in the drivers championship with Pierre Gasly and Alexander Albon , who both spent part of the season in a much faster Red Bull . At the , Sainz was initially classified 4th , having started in 20th and last place following an engine problem in qualifying , but was elevated to 3rd after Lewis Hamilton received a penalty for causing a collision with Alexander Albon , earning Sainz his first podium in Formula One . Sainz has nearly doubled his points total from his previous best season , 2017 .

    "story": "Amr Zaki\nAmr Hassan Zaki ( ; born 1 April 1983 ) is an Egyptian retired professional footballer who played as a striker .\nHe has played for numerous different clubs in Egypt , Russia , England , Turkey and Kuwait . Zaki has made 63 appearances and scored 30 goals for the Egyptian national team . In his career , Zaki has been nicknamed the bulldozer and has been likened to former England striker Alan Shearer .\nHowever , his career has not been without controversy . He was labelled highly unprofessional by former Wigan manager Steve Bruce . Also , his decision not to join English club Portsmouth due to the nationality of some of the players garnered much criticism in the English press .\nClub career .\nEarly career .\nBorn in Mansoura , Zaki started his career at El Mansoura . He moved to ENPPI for the 2003–04 season . At ENPPI , he became the Egyptian Premier League top goalscorer for the 2004–05 season and helped the club win its first trophy , the 2005 Egyptian Cup , as well as being runners-up in the Egyptian Premier League ,\nAfter impressing in the 2006 African Cup of Nations , Zaki caught the attention of many clubs , such as El Zamalek and Al-Ahly from Egypt , Al-Ain FC from the UAE , and Nantes from France . But Zaki later decided to play for Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow , who signed him for a reported sum of €1.7 million . However , he did not play a single match for Lokomotiv .\nIn 2006 , Zaki moved back to the Egyptian Premier League and signed to play for El Zamalek . Owing to his powerful physical displays as a forward , fans nicknamed him the Bulldozer and newspapers nicknamed him the Egyptian Gladiator .\nWigan Athletic .\nOn 22 July 2008 , Wigan Athletic completed a one-year loan deal to bring Zaki to the JJB Stadium for a sum of £1.5 million . After scoring two goals in his two pre-season appearances for Wigan , Zaki scored on his league debut on 16 August against West Ham United . On 30 August he scored his first brace for Wigan in a 5–0 victory over Premier League new-boys Hull City . On 13 September he scored his fourth goal in as many games in the Premier League as Wigan drew with Sunderland , putting him joint top of the goal scoring charts alongside Jermain Defoe . On 28 September , Zaki scored again in the Premier League from the penalty spot against Manchester City , and this goal took him to the top of the goal scorers list with 5 goals in 6 games . He followed it with two more goals against Liverpool , further solidifying his position as top scorer in the English Premier League . He also scored penalties in 2–1 victories over Portsmouth and Newcastle . At one point he was the third top scorer in the Premier League behind Chelseas Nicolas Anelka and Manchester Citys Robinho who had 15 and 12 respectively to Zakis 10 , however he failed to add to that tally in which Anelka finished top with 19 .\nWigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan likened Zaki to Alan Shearer , saying when you look at this lad and his build.. . He has the same confidence when he gets the ball , he knows where the goal is , he doesnt need to look up , he has this instinct . Strikers like that have an instinct as to where the goal is . You cant describe it , you cant give it to anybody . Former Wigan manager Steve Bruce has also been highly impressed with Zaki , and has told the press he believes he is awesome . Bruce said he put in a fantastic performance . If he keeps playing like that he is going to have a real future in the Premier League and his physique is great , he has awesome power and pace and of course he wants to score goals which is the important thing .\nControversy .\nIn April 2009 , Zaki failed to return to Wigan Athletic from one of Egypts World Cup qualification matches , leading his former-club manager , Steve Bruce , to label him as the most unprofessional player he had ever worked with . His late returns from international duty led to Bruce publicly branding Zaki highly unprofessional and fining him the maximum amount permitted , which he has done on more than one occasion ;\nBefore this latest incident , Zaki had already been fined considerably more than the average person in Britain earns in a year and he will now face another heavy fine . However , Bruce said that repeatedly fining him does not seem to alter his poor behaviour . Bruce subsequently confirmed on 17 May 2009 that the club will not be taking up the option of making his loan deal permanent .\nReturn to Zamalek .\nZaki returned to Egyptian Premier League side El Zamalek for the 2009–10 season . During the summer transfer window he turned down a move to English Premier League club Portsmouth , which had been strongly linked with the player . This has been largely criticized in the English press , because his refusal was due to the presence of two Algerians and an Israeli on the team . Zaki said after Portsmouth signed an Israeli player and also hired an Israeli football director a possible move was ruled out . On top of that , no way could I play at Portsmouth with an Algerian within their ranks . During his time at El Zamalek he struggled with injuries , sickness , goal scoring ducks , and his spot on the team .\nHull City .\nOn 17 January 2010 , Zaki passed a medical with Hull City moving to the club on a 5-month loan .\nOn 30 January 2010 he made his debut for Hull coming on as substitute for Jozy Altidore in the 69-minute . Hull went on to draw the match 2–2 with Wolverhampton Wanderers .\nAmr Zaki quoted If an offer from a decent club does not come up by the end of my time at Hull , then I will return to Zamalek . On 17 April 2010 it was confirmed by his agent that his loan had been terminated and he returned to Zamalek .\nReturn to Zamalek .\nZaki returned to Zamalek at the beginning of the 2010–11 season and gave phenomenal performances becoming the teams top scorer after scoring 3 goals in the leagues first 4 matches . However , in October 2010 Zaki suffered a career threatening injury that kept him away for the better part of 10 months . Zaki returned from injury and participated with Zamalek in the Egypt Cup , scoring twice in the semi-final match against defending champions Haras El-Hodood , thus leading his team to qualify for the final with a 2–1 victory .\nIn November 2011 , Zaki had a financial dispute with Zamalek board over his unpaid wages , claiming that he hasnt been paid over a year . The dispute lasted 3 months before Zamalek chairman , Mamdouh Abbas , paid Zaki a large percentage of his late wages . Zaki made his first appearance for Zamalek after the dispute , coming on as a second-half substitute in a Round of 64 CAF Champions League game against Tanzanian club Young Africans . Zaki scored the equalizer goal in the 74th minute , and the game finished 1–1 .\nAfter his return to Zamalek from his loan moves from Hull City and Wigan , Zaki received many offers to play abroad , including good offers from Russia , China , and France , but Zamalek kept on refusing to let him go , as he was considered one of the teams main pillars and star players .\nOn 5 June 2012 , Zaki told Egyptian sports website FilGoal that he relished a return to play in England again . This came in parallel with Egypt U-23 coach Hany Ramzy statement that Zaki may be called up to play for Egypt in the 2012 London Olympics U-23 tournament as one of the 3 allowed overage players . Zaki commented on that by saying , “I think its a good chance for me to re-appear on English grounds . It is an opportunity to be watched again . Eventually , Zaki was not picked for the Olympics by Ramzy . However , since Zamalek continued to face financial problems throughout 2011 and 2012 , Zaki started to be considered on his way out of the club as a way to bring in cash . Gaziantepspor and other Turkish sides along with some English teams and other Persian Gulf sides have all shown their interest in Zaki . On 20 July 2012 , English Championship side Blackpool sent an official request to the player to go on a one-week trial at the club . Zaki and Zamalek had accepted the trial offer , but Blackpool later pulled out of the transfer negotiations and cancelled their trial offer . Fellow Championship club Middlesbrough had also shown an interest as well . Zaki stated his desire to join Middlesbrough after speaking with his former teammate Mido about the club and insisted on a two-year contract , but Manager Tony Mowbray only offered Zaki a deal until the end of the season . Zaki turned down the offer . Zakis agent later said , Everything was agreed , his medical , his contract , his house , but Middlesbrough changed their minds at the last minute . Amr wanted to join Middlesbrough and help them win promotion , it was not about money . Amr was ready to travel . A Middlesbrough spokesman stated that Zaki was one of a number of players being chased by the club , and no offer was submitted to the player .\nElazığspor .\nIn late July 2012 , Turkish side Gaziantepspor offered Zamalek club 250,000 Euros for Zaki , and Zamalek accepted the offer on 31 July 2012 . However , speculation appeared on the bid after Gaziantepspor failed to send the official contract on the agreed deadline . Because of that , Zakis move to Gaziantepspor was thrown into doubt , and fellow Turkish side Elazığspor began to show interest in signing the player . On 6 August , Elazığspor club official Selçuk Cengiz Öztürk stated that Elazığspor have reached an agreement with Zamalek to sign Zaki according to Elazığspor manager Bülent Uygun and it is expected that he will join on a three-year deal . He later stated that he will arrive in Egypt on Monday 7 August to complete the move . On the next day , Gaziantepspor officially dropped out of the negotiations with Zamalek due to unstated reasons . Later on , Elazığspor officially signed Zaki on a two-year deal , for the same price which Gaziantepspor had previously offered ( 250,000 Euros ) During the contract agreement phase , Zaki requested to put a special clause in his contract which states that if Elazığspor get relegated to the Turkish second division , Zaki would be free to leave the club if he wants .\nAfter missing the first 2 games of the season due to registration and contractual problems , Zaki made his debut for Elazığspor in a 0–3 loss against Kasimpasa SK , coming in as a substitute in halftime . After losing 0–3 to Beşiktaş in his second game , Zaki put in a wonderful performance in his third appearance against Bursaspor , scoring an assist and scoring a disallowed goal due to Zaki being in an offside position . After that , a couple of injuries kept Zaki on the sidelines a few times , and he was able to make only 8 appearances out of potential 17 .\nNear the end of December 2012 , Zaki asked Elazığspor to allow him to leave the club , as he had received a number of offers from England , France , Ukraine , and the Persian Gulf region . Elazığspor board conceded to give up on the player for a fee of 400,000 Euros . However , no club met the €400,000 price tag that the Turkish Club had put on Zaki , and Zaki later agreed with the club board to rescind his contract due to his not receiving his wages since two months . In late January , Zaki had officially rescinded his contract with the club he became a free agent . He finished his short stint with the Turkish club without goals and with only one assist .\nReturn to ENPPI .\nAfter being close to signing with Ukrainian giants Shakhtar Donetsk in the 2013 winter transfer window , Zaki made a surprise move to former club ENPPI that surprised Egyptian and football fans around the world . Zaki had signed for 2 and half years keeping him at the Egyptian club until June 2015 . It was mostly expected that Zaki would return to his home club Zamalek once again but Zaki had explained that the Zamalek chairman Mamdouh Abbas had rejected his return to Zamalek . Twelve days after his signing with the club , Zaki and the club had terminated the players contract after a disagreement between the two sides . And Zaki was once again a free agent .\nAl-Salmiya .\nOn 18 June 2013 , Zaki officially signed for Kuwaiti club Al-Salmiya for one year and was presented to the press a few days after . He received the number 9 jersey . On his debut , Zaki scored in the league opener against Yarmouk scoring the final goal in Al-Salmiyas 4-0 win . In the third game of the season against Kazma , he scored his 2nd goal in 3 games scoring Al-Salmiyas first goal in a 3–1 win over the Kuwaiti giants . After suffering a couple injuries and some minor issues with his salary , in December 2013 Zaki and Al Salmiya agreed to terminate the players contract to prevent any more financial issues and also because Zaki wasnt performing as well as hed hoped in the Kuwaiti Premier League and wanted to move to Europe or a different Arab League . Zaki ended his stint with Al Salmiya with 2 goals and an assist from 9 matches .\nRaja Casablanca .\nOn 30 December 2013 , it was reported that Zaki was going to join Moroccan champions Raja Casablanca on 1 January 2014 when the winter transfer window re-opened . In a friendly match , Zaki broke his foot and ankle ligaments and required surgery which would leave Zaki out action for up to 3–4 months , which resulted in him missing the rest of the 2013–14 season . However , controversy broke out when the club claimed they had no knowledge that Zaki went to do a surgery on his foot , and they later expressed their anger with Zaki for not letting the club officials know that he was going to perform a surgery . Raja Casablanca and Zaki later agreed to the termination of the contract to avoid any further issues . Zaki featured in three friendlies during the clubs winter break , scoring 1 goal . He never made an official competitive appearance for Raja Casablanca . And for the fourth time in two years , Zaki was once again a free agent .\nAl Ahed .\nOn 16 August 2014 , Zaki signed a one-year deal with Lebanese Premier League club Al Ahed . The transfer was the most expensive in the history of the league to date . On 12 September 2014 , he terminated his contract with the club due to injury concerns . He didnt play a single game with the club .\nEl Mokawloon .\nIn January 2015 he signed with El Mokawloon an 18-month-contract uniting with his former coach in national team Hassan Shehata . He made his return to football after almost 400 days away from the game in round 32 in Egypt Cup .\nRetirement .\nOn 18 August 2015 , Zaki announced retirement from football via his Twitter account .\nInternational career .\nZaki played for the Egyptian National Team . In the 2006 African Cup of Nations Zaki scored the winning goal for Egypt in the semi-final against Senegal late in the second half , with his first touch moments after coming off the bench to replace a visibly irate Mido – whose argument with coach Hassan Shehata held up play and resulted in a six-month international ban from the Egyptian Football Association for the player . Egypt later went on to win their fifth continental title .\nTwo years later in the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations , Zaki scored a goal against Zambia in the group stage and another in the quarter final against Angola . Additionally , he scored another header and then added another goal in the semi-final match against Ivory Coast . Egypt again went on to win the title for a record sixth time . He was chosen in the CAN 2008 All Star Starting XI .\nAfter Egypts failure to qualify to the 2010 FIFA World Cup , Zaki was fairly absent from the national squad for almost two years due to his many injuries with Hull City and Zamalek for the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons . After American Bob Bradley took over as coach of the national team , Zaki had been called up to the squad three times ( November 2011 , March 2012 , and April 2012 ) and Zaki dropped out of the squad due to injury each time . Bradley was done with Zaki after citing an ear infection being the reason for Zaki to drop out for the third time . Media reported that Zaki was trying to avoid the national team and playing under Bradley , but he denied these rumors claiming that he ready to be called up at any time from now on . And finally after a lengthy absence from the national team , he was recalled by Bradley in October 2012 to play two friendlies against DR Congo and Tunisia . After nearly a 4-year goal drought , Zaki scored in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Guinea on 10 September 2013 , scoring the fourth goal in the 4-2 win .\nPersonal life .\nZaki is a practicing Muslim and has stated that “When I was in England I was eager to fast all the time and keep praying and also reading Quran in my spare time . He once went 24 days without eating as stated on BBC ones Match of The Day . I fasted on every day and I don’t think it affected my performance – actually I think I got stronger . I have played many matches on days which I have fasted.” Despite Zakis insistence that fasting has never affected him , it was to prove a sticking point at Wigan . “The manager Steve Bruce said to me that he understands my fast but he can’t let me play while Im fasting . “He told me that I have to choose .

    "story": "Ma Yinchu\nMa Yinchu ( ; 1882–1982 ) was a prominent Chinese economist . He was the father of family planning .\nBiography .\nEarly life .\nMa Yinchu was born in Sheng County , Shaoxing , Zhejiang . He was the fifth child of the owner of a small distillery that specialized in fermented rice liquor . While his father wished for him to carry on this business , Ma showed an inclination toward scholarship . As a result , his father cut him off financially , and their relationship never recovered . At 16 , Ma attended middle school in Shanghai . Despite losing his fathers support , he studied mining and metallurgy at Beiyang University ( now called Tianjin University ) . In 1907 , Ma received government sponsorship to study economics at Yale University , after which he received a Ph.D . in economics and philosophy from Columbia University in 1914 . In 1920 he helped to found the Shanghai College of Commerce , and in 1923 he became the founding president of the Chinese Economics Society . During the 1930s , Ma began to criticize the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek , and was subsequently placed under house arrest from 1940 to 1942 . In 1949 , at the request of Zhou Enlai , he served as a nonpartisan delegate to the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference . From 1950 to 1951 , he served as the president of Zhejiang University , and then as the president of Peking University from 1951 to 1960 . In this position , Ma was well liked , and seen as warm and genuine by his students . However , he was removed due to his unorthodox economic views .\nNew Population Theory .\nIn June 1957 , at the fourth session of the First National Peoples Congress , Ma presented his New Population Theory . Having examined trends of the early 1950s , he concluded that further population growth at such high rates would be detrimental to Chinas development . Therefore , he advocated government control of fertility . During the following three years , Mas theory suffered two rounds of attacks , and he was dismissed from public life . The charges of the government were that the theory followed Malthusianism , attempted to discredit the superiority of socialism , and showed contempt for the people .\nRehabilitation and later life .\nMas New Population Theory did not receive mention in the Peoples Daily again until June 5 , 1979 . On July 26 of the same year , the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China formally apologized to him , stating that events had validated his theory . In September 1979 , all charges against him were retracted , and he was made honorary president of Peking University . Ma Yinchu died on May 10 , 1982 due to heart and lung disease and pneumonia .\nLegacy .\nEven before Mas death , scholars were realizing the enormity of the governments error in censoring his views for two decades . This view can be demonstrated by the title of a newspaper article published in 1979 : Erroneously criticized one person , population mistakenly increased 300,000,000 . Mas theory also became enshrined in public policy ; Chinas One Child Policy draws heavily on Mas reasoning that the State should have the power to intervene in reproduction and to control population , and follows his advice in heavily utilizing propaganda on the dangers of population growth . In Mas hometown , a middle school has been named in his honor . His birth home is being renovated as a museum , and the street on which it resides is now called Famous Man Street . Nationally , the scholar is featured prominently in primary and middle school textbooks as Uncle Ma , where he is praised for his contributions to population control and environmental protection . In 1997 , a nine-part series about his life was aired in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the publication of his population theory .",

    "story": "Achilles Papapetrou\nAchille Papapetrou ( ; February 2 , 1907 – August 12 , 1997 ) was a Greek theoretical physicist , who contributed to the general theory of relativity . He is known for the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations , the Majumdar–Papapetrou solution , and the Weyl−Lewis−Papapetrou coordinates of gravity theory .\nHe worked on exact solutions of Einsteins field equations and long sought a solution for rotating masses , which , however , were only found by Roy Kerr . Papapetrou was then the first who recognized and jubilantly welcomed Kerrs breakthrough announced at the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics , Dallas , December 1963 .\nEarly life and education .\nPapapetrou was born in Irakleia Serres in Northern Greece ( Macedonia province ) , on February 2 , 1907 . His father was a schoolteacher . During World War I , his family was deported from Serres , but returned at the end of the war .\nFrom 1925 , Papapetrou studied mechanical and electrical engineering at the National Technical University of Athens , graduating in 1930 . While a student , he was an assistant in the mathematics department , and he started work as an engineer .\nResearch .\nHis start in physics , in 1934 , was through graduate studies on solid state physics under Paul Peter Ewald enabled through a scholarship , at the Technical University of Stuttgart . While there , he started working with Helmut Hönl , who was instrumental in the development of his interest in theory of relativity . In 1935 , he earned his PhD there , with a dissertation on Investigations on the dendrite growth of crystals , and subsequently returned to the Technical University in Athens as an assistant in electrical engineering .\nIn 1940−1946 , he was professor of physics at the National Technical University of Athens , where he gave seminars on the theory of relativity , and worked in relative isolation during the German occupation of that country . After the end of the war , and in the preamble to the civil war that followed , he was fired from that post for his sympathies with the left-leaning resistance movement . As a result , in 1946 , he moved to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies at the invitation of Erwin Schrödinger , with whom he worked on unified field theories .\nFrom 1948 on , he worked at the University of Manchester where he was a colleague of Leon Rosenfeld and worked on the equations of motion of GR , as well as the equations of motion of particles with spin in GR .\nIn 1952–1961 he was a researcher at the Research Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences in East Berlin , and from 1957 professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin where , among others , Georg Dautcourt and Hans-Jürgen Treder were his pupils .\nDuring 1960–61 , he was visiting a group of relativity theorists , including André Lichnerowicz and Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat . From 1962 he was at the Institute Henri Poincaré ( IHP ) in Paris . At the same time , he was research director of CNRS . Among others , he worked on elastic waves in gravitational radiation detectors , shells of matter and their gravitational collapse , the Newman−Penrose formalism and its identities , stationary axially symmetric gravitational fields , and gravitational and electromagnetic radiation fields .\nIn 1975 , he became Director of the IHP Laboratory of Theoretical Physics , and in 1977 he retired , remaining scientifically active . He was a visiting scientist at Princeton ( 1964–65 ) , the University of Vienna ( 1970–71 ) , and Boston University ( 1972 ) . He later took French citizenship . From 1971 on , he was one of the organizing committee members of the international conferences on general relativity and gravitation ( GRG ) .\nHe died in Paris , on August 12 , 1997 .\nSelected works .\nPapapetrou has published two books ,\n- A .

    "story": "Uta Frith\nUta Frith ( née Aurnhammer ; born 25 May 1941 ) is a German developmental psychologist working at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London . She has pioneered much of the current research into autism and dyslexia , and has written several books on the two subjects arguing for autism to be considered a mental condition rather than being caused by parenting . Her book introduces the cognitive neuroscience of autism . She is credited for creating the Sally-Anne test along with fellow scientists Alan Leslie and Simon Baron-Cohen . She also pioneered the work with child dyslexia . Among the students she has mentored are Tony Attwood , Maggie Snowling , Simon Baron-Cohen and Francesca Happé .\nEducation .\nFrith was born Uta Aurnhammer in Rockenhausen , a small village in the hills between Luxembourg and Mannheim in Germany . She attended the Saarland University in Saarbrücken with her initial plan for her education in art history , but changed to experimental psychology after learning of its empirical nature . She was inspired by the work of many psychologists and psychoanalysts , such as Hans Eysenck , and decided to train in clinical psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry in London . While at the Institute of Psychiatry , she worked closely with Jack Rachman . She went on to complete her Doctor of Philosophy , on pattern detection in neurotypical and autistic children , in 1968 .\nShe was mentored , during her early career , by Neil OConnor and Beate Hermelin and has described them as pioneers in the field of autism .\nResearch .\nFriths research paved the way for a theory of mind deficit in autism . While she was a member of the Cognitive Development Unit ( CDU ) in London , in 1985 she published with Alan M . Leslie and Simon Baron-Cohen the article Does the autistic child have a theory of mind? , which proposed that people with autism have specific difficulties understanding other peoples beliefs and desires . Frith , along with Alan Leslie and Simon Baron-Cohen , created two theories of autism . The first is lack of implicit mentalization – lack of the ability to know ones own mental state . The second is weak central coherence , by which she suggested that individuals with autism are better than typical at processing details , but worse at integrating information from many different sources . Frith was one of the first neuro-scientists to recognize autism as a condition of the brain rather than the result of cold parenting . In 1985 , Frith , Leslie , and Baron-Cohen created the Sally-Anne test to measure a childs cognitive understanding . A child with autism would generally get the Sally-Anne questions incorrect , while a typical child or a child with Down Syndrome would generally get the questions correct . In 1996 , Frith , Eraldo Paulesu , and Maggie Snowling conducted a longitudinal research study showing that , while completing tasks requiring phonological processing , people with autism show a lack of connectivity between the front and back of their brain .\nShe was one of the first in the UK to study Aspergers syndrome , at CDU London . Her work focused on reading development , spelling and dyslexia . Frith attacked the theory that dyslexia was linked to lack of intelligence or caused by impairment in visual recognition . In 1980 , she published a book on dyslexia , recounting how patients with dyslexia can be perfectly apt readers , but have persistent spelling errors , whereas it had commonly been thought was that the two entities were not mutually exclusive . Her research , along with Maggie Snowlings , showed that dyslexics tend to struggle with phonological processing .\nShe has been supported through her career by the Medical Research Council at University College London . Frith is an active collaborator at the Interacting Minds Centre at Aarhus University in Denmark . The goal of the centre is to provide a trans-disciplinary platform , upon which the many aspects of human interaction may be studied . The project is based in part on a paper written with Chris Frith : Interacting Minds – a Biological Basis .\nSupporting women in science .\nFrith has advocated the advancement of women in science , in part by developing a support network called Science & Shopping , which she hopes will encourage women to share ideas and information that are inspiring and fun . She also co-founded the UCL Women network , a grassroots networking and social organization for academic staff ( postdocs and above ) in STEM at UCL , in January 2013 . In 2015 she was named chair of the Royal Societys Diversity Committee , where she has written about unconscious bias and how it affects which scientists receive grants .\nIn the media .\nOn 11 May 2012 Frith appeared as a guest on the American PBS Charlie Rose television interview show . On 4 December she appeared as a guest on the Brain episode of BBC Twos Dara Ó Briains Science Club .\nOn 1 March 2013 she was the guest on BBC Radio 4s Desert Island Discs .\nFrith has written on the visibility of women in science , by promoting an exhibition on female scientist portraits at The Royal Society in 2013 .\nFrom 31 March to 4 April 2014 , to coincide with World Autism Awareness Day on 2 April , she was the guest of Sarah Walker on BBC Radio 3s Essential Classics . On 1 April 2014 , she featured in Living with Autism , an episode of the BBCs Horizon documentary series .\nOn 26 August 2015 she presented the Horizon episode entitled OCD : A Monster in my Mind , and on 29 August 2017 she presented the Horizon episode entitled What Makes a Psychopath? .\nOn 13 December 2017 Frith gave an interview to the Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health , in which she talked about her early life and her passion for autism research in children .\nFrith is also active on twitter ( @utafrith ) .\nAwards .\nFrith was elected a Fellow of the British Academy and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2001 , a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2005 , an Honorary Fellow of the British Psychological Society in 2006 , a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 2008 , an Honorary Fellow of Newnham College , Cambridge in 2008 , a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012 , an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2012 , and a Williams James Fellow Award in 2013 . She was President of the Experimental Psychology Society in 2006–2007 .

In a brief break in his career he was Inspector of Prisons for Scotland . After the liberation of Europe he went into politics and served for fourteen years as a Unionist Party Member of Parliament ( MP ) in Scotland , becoming known for humorous remarks combined with a lively partisanship .\nEarly life and First World War .\nDuncan was the only son of Alfred Edward Duncan , and was sent to Merchant Taylors School . At the outbreak of the First World War , Duncan joined the London Scottish , serving in France and Belgium . At the beginning of January 1917 , while holding the rank of lieutenant ( and temporary Captain ) , he was awarded the Military Cross . He was later transferred to the Black Watch for whom he served in Germany after the armistice and into 1919 . During the war , Duncan was twice Mentioned in Despatches , and was also wounded in action . He ended the war with the substantive rank of captain .\nInter-war army career .\nAfter the end of the war , Duncan formed a business partnership with his father , who was a produce broker in the City of London . He married Mary Bourne on 2 April 1919 at Leavesden , Hertfordshire . However , Duncan , still an officer in the Black Watch , was posted to India later in 1919 ; he decided to remain in the army and not to pursue his business , and so the partnership with his father was dissolved on 1 July 1921 .\nIn India , Duncan was a staff officer with the Western Command in Quetta from 1923 to 1927 . He returned to Britain in 1927 , and was a staff officer on the Northern Command based in York from 1929 to 1933 . He returned to India in 1933 for four more years with the Black Watch , before retiring from the army , with the rank of major , in 1937 . He moved to Bridge of Earn in Perthshire , and in 1938 he assumed by Authority the surname of Gomme-Duncan instead of Duncan .\nRecall to the colours .\nOn 1 November 1938 it was announced that Gomme-Duncan had been appointed HM Inspector of Prisons for Scotland . This was to be a brief appointment , for Gomme-Duncan was recalled to the Colours as a reservist in June 1939 . He was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General at the War Office .\n1940 saw Gomme-Duncan placed in command of the 70th Battalion of the Black Watch . In 1941 he was attached to the Royal Air Force , and in 1942 he became assistant adjutant-general at the War Office . Preparing for the invasion of France , Gomme-Duncan commanded 101 Reinforcement Group within 21 Army Group from 1943 to 1944 ; he went across to France with the Second Army , where he held a command in Normandy and also served in Belgium and the Netherlands . He finally left the army , as a colonel , in 1945 .\nPolitical career .\nFor the 1945 general election , Gomme-Duncan was chosen as the Unionist Party candidate for Perth , which included his home at Bridge of Earn , and where the sitting member was retiring . Gomme-Duncan easily won election to the House of Commons , obtaining a majority of 10,867 .\nIn November 1945 Gomme-Duncan seconded a motion calling on the Government to withdraw a proposal to build a hydro-electric scheme on a particularly picturesque highland lake ; he asserted that Parliament should not be led by the Electricity Commissioners in deciding which schemes to progress , and urged the government to consult the people of Scotland . He opposed the Civil Aviation Bill , arguing that it abrogated the Treaty of Union which guaranteed Scotland freedom of navigation in England .\nIndian independence .\nGomme-Duncan spoke from experience in late 1946 when he opposed independence for India , contending that the Congress Party consisted of moneylenders and landlords who did not recognise their responsibilities to the peasants , while the British were the only people for 200 years who protected the toiling masses . He also defended the landlord and tenant system in Scotland . He succeeded in May 1948 in getting a pledge from Secretary of State for War Emanuel Shinwell that the Highland regiments would once again be supplied with kilts .\nHe was a critic of the Governments policy in Palestine when the British mandate was surrendered , arguing that the withdrawal of British troops had been mishandled and that the Governments orders had favoured Jews over Arabs . On 30 November Gomme-Duncan presented a petition signed by 530,000 housewives who called on the Government to provide a fuller ration of fresh and varied meat , and a larger share of unrationed meat . In addition to serious points , however , Gomme-Duncan became known for making humorous remarks in Parliament , frequently provoking laughter .\nScotland within the United Kingdom .\nAt the 1950 general election , Gomme-Duncans constituency was subjected to boundary changes and renamed Perth and East Perthshire . Gomme-Duncan increased his majority to 13,144 , although the constituency saw the Scottish National Party obtain its highest vote of that election .\nGomme-Duncan was gratified by the overall electoral failure of the SNP but urged that the signing of the Covenant by a million people be recognised as a sign of dissatisfaction and a commission established to look at the facts and figures . When the Stone of Scone was recovered after its kidnap by Scottish nationalists , he called for a tactful response including leaving the stone in Scotland ; when it was eventually returned to Westminster Abbey , he voiced his opposition .\nPolitical partisanship .\nIn September 1950 Gomme-Duncan was made a delegate to the conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in New Zealand . After the Conservatives returned to power in the 1951 general election , he asserted that there was a serious lessening in the high reputation of the House of Commons due to the factious opposition . He good-humouredly suggested sending Hewlett Johnson , the Red Dean of Canterbury , to a psychiatrist when the Dean circulated Communist propaganda .\nGomme-Duncan ran into controversy in late 1952 , when he claimed that the chairman of British European Airways , Lord Douglas of Kirtleside , had made a political speech to BEA workers claiming that a Labour government would increase their wages . Lord Douglas denied making any such speech and the Minister of Civil Aviation Alan Lennox-Boyd accepted his denial and issued a statement of confidence . Gomme-Duncan was obliged to withdraw his remarks . However his popularity did not suffer and soon after he was elected a vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee .\nHe returned to the issue of hydroelectricity in early 1953 , moving to cancel a project in Breadalbane , Perthshire . He was re-elected in the 1955 general election with a majority of 13,721 over the Scottish National Party candidate , the partys former MP Dr Robert McIntyre . In the new Parliament he opposed proposals to increase the school leaving age to 16 , saying it would , without qualification , be a disaster .\nPolitical and lodge honours .\nIn the 1956 New Year Honours list , Gomme-Duncan was created a Knight Bachelor for political and public services . He was staunchly loyal to the Government over the Suez Crisis , complaining at the outset that some broadcasts by the BBC to Egypt contained complete nonsense in presenting the British case . After the invasion he supported a motion critical of United States policy towards Suez for endangering the Atlantic alliance . He was appointed a Senior Grand Deacon in the United Grand Lodge of Freemasons in April 1956 .\nRetirement .\nAt the beginning of 1957 , just after Sir Anthony Eden resigned as prime minister , Gomme-Duncan announced that he would retire at the end of the Parliament . Given the high political tension , the chairman of the Perth and East Perthshire Unionist Association stressed that there was no connection between the two events , and when Gomme-Duncan next spoke it was to attack the Labour MP Edith Summerskill for remarks which Gomme-Duncan asserted had disparaged British troops . He got into a shouting match with the Labour spokesman George Brown who defended Summerskill and disputed that she had made any such remarks . Gomme-Duncan duly retired at the 1959 general election .\nIn Scotland , Gomme-Duncan held several positions of honour , including membership of the Royal Company of Archers ( the Sovereigns Bodyguard in Scotland ) ; he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland . Gomme-Duncan was president of the Perthshire Musical Festival Association and vice-president of Perthshire Agricultural Society and of the Boy Scouts in Perth District .",

    "story": "Lapland Ranger Regiment\nThe Lapland Ranger Regiment ( ) , designations I 22 , I 22/Fo 66 and I 22/GJ 66 , was a Swedish Army light infantry regiment , one of the few new formations raised in the 20th century . The regiment was garrisoned in Lapland . The unit was disbanded as a result of the disarmament policies set forward in the Defence Act of 2000 .\nHistory .\nThe regiment traced its origins from the elite Skidlöparbataljonen ( Skirunners Battalion ) , of Norrbotten Regiment ( I 19 ) , the battalion was raised in 1910 as the first modern ranger unit of the Swedish Army and the first unit specializing in arctic warfare . The battalion was garrisoned in northern Lapland Kiruna in 1940 and was renamed in 1943 as Jägarbataljon K ( Ranger Battalion K ) , K for Kiruna , which became Swedens first special operation unit . In 1945 the battalion became an independent training unit under the army high command as the Army Ranger School for setting up and training three army corps ranger battalions and long range recon companies and special operation units . The unit received independent regimental status with a regimental standard from the hands of the King in 1975 , and was renamed Lapplands jägarregemente I 22 , I 22 stood for infantry regiment no 22 . The Lapland Ranger Regiment was finally disbanded in 2000 . Its tasks and personnel were largely transferred to the heavier equipped Norrland Dragoon Regiment ( K 4 ) , a former mounted ranger cavalry unit that had a de facto light infantry role , later in turn reorganized and downsized as the Army Ranger Battalion as part of the Norrbotten Regiment , the original mother regiment of Lapland Rangers .\nThe rangers of the Lapland Ranger Regiment and the Ranger School wore a green commando beret , from 1960 onward , with the units insignia a crowned wolfs head . For ranger qualification the soldiers had to pass a demanding 7-day march exercise , with daily distances between 25 and 50 kilometers ( 15–31 miles ) carrying 35 to 50 kilo ( 77–110 pounds ) rucksacks , in rough mountain terrain . Despite this the pass rate was high , due to 2 to 3 months prior extensive tough heavy load marching training for recruits .\nOrganisation .\nThe regiment raised independent ranger companies , one or two per year , that was specialized in behind enemy lines operations in Arctic environment on small unit bases , ranger troops . The requirement was for a ranger troop to be able to sustain high combat capability for at least 30 days of operations behind enemy lines without supplies .\nHeraldry and traditions .\nColours , standards and guidons .\nWhen the regiment was raised on 1 July 1975 , the regiment inherited the colour of the Army Ranger School from 1948 . A new colour was presented to the Lappland Ranger Regiment ( I 22/Fo 66 ) in Kiruna by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 8 September 1983 . 8 September became from 1983 the regiments anniversary . The colour of Lapland Ranger Regiment was drawn by Ingrid Lamby and embroidered by machine in insertion technique . The manufacturer is unknown . It was used as regimental colour by I 22/Fo 66 until 1 July 2000 .

    "story": "Giovanni Trapattoni\nGiovanni Trapattoni ( ; born 17 March 1939 ) , sometimes popularly known as Trap or Il Trap , is an Italian football manager and former footballer , considered the most successful club coach in the modern era of Serie A . A former defensive midfielder , as a player he spent almost his entire club career with A.C . Milan , where he won two Serie A league titles ( 1961–62 and 1967–68 ) , and two European Cups , in 1962–63 and 1968–69 . Internationally , he played for Italy , earning 17 caps and being part of the squad at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile .\nOne of the most celebrated managers in football history , Trapattoni is one of only five coaches , alongside Carlo Ancelotti , Ernst Happel , José Mourinho and Tomislav Ivić to have won league titles in four different European countries ; in total , Trapattoni has won 10 league titles in Italy , Germany , Portugal and Austria . Alongside Udo Lattek , he is the only coach to have won all three major European club competitions ( European Cup , UEFA Cup , UEFA Cup Winners Cup ) and the only one to make it with the same club ( Juventus ) . Also , he is the only one to have won all official continental club competitions and the world title , achieving this with Juventus during his first spell with the club . He is one of the rare few to have won the European Cup , the Cup Winners Cup and Intercontinental Cup as both a player and manager .\nRegarded as the most famous and consistent disciple of Nereo Rocco , Trapattoni coached his native Italy national team to the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004 , but could not replicate his club successes with Italy , suffering a controversial early exit in both competitions . Trapattoni was most recently the manager of the Republic of Ireland national football team . He led them to their first European Championships in 24 years , enjoying a successful UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign . This followed narrowly missing out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup , after his team were controversially knocked out by France .\nClub career .\nBorn in Cusano Milanino near Milan , Trapattoni had a successful career as a player with A.C . Milan , playing either as a central defender or as a defensive midfielder with the main task of passing the ball to more creative players such as Giovanni Lodetti and Gianni Rivera . He won two Serie A titles ( 1961–62 , 1967–68 ) and two European Cups ( 1962–63 , 1968–69 ) during his time with Milan , and was one of the stars of the 1963 European Cup Final against Benfica , successfully man-marking Eusébio in the second half . Similarly , in the teams 4–1 victory in the 1969 European Cup Final against Ajax , he drew praise in the Italian media for his defending and ability to nullify the offensive threat of Johann Cruyff .\nAfter taking a break from the national team , Trapattoni thought he could settle with a mid-table team for one last season instead of being at one club all his life , subsequently moving to Varese and , after a successful season with them , retired from professional football and embarked on a highly successful managerial career two years later .\nInternational career .\nTrapattoni also played for the Italy national football team between 1960 and 1964 , earning 17 caps and scoring 1 goal . Most notably , he was part of the squad at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile , although he was unable to play any matches during the tournament after sustaining an injury .\nTrapattoni is also remembered for his performance in Italys 3–0 friendly victory over Brazil at the San Siro stadium in Milan on 12 May 1963 ; during the match , he was able to nullify Pelés impact on the game through his man-marking ability , with the latter asking to be substituted for Quarentinha in the 26th minute of the second half , whom Trapattoni also successfully defended . However , Pelé later stated in 2000 that his performance was due to stomach pains , and that he was forced to play due to contractual obligations ; Trapattoni himself also frequently downplayed his performance during the match , even prior to Pelés comments , stating : the truth is that on that day he was half-injured . Tired . I was a good footballer , but lets leave Pelé alone . He was a martian .\nStyle of play .\nA talented defensive-minded player , Trapattoni was capable of playing both in defence , as a centre-back , and in midfield , as a defensive midfielder , due to his work-rate and ability to win back possession and subsequently distribute the ball forward to his more offensive-minded teammates . Above all , he was known for his excellent man-marking skills .\nCoaching career .\n1974–86 : Early career at A.C . Milan and Juventus .\nTrapattoni began coaching at Milan as a youth team coach , before becoming caretaker coach . Trapattoni was caretaker coach from 9 April 1974 to 30 June 1974 . His first match was the UEFA Cup Winners Cup semi–final first leg against Borussia Mönchengladbach . Milan won the match 2–0 . They got to the final after only losing the second leg 1–0 . Milan lost the final 2–0 to East German club 1 . FC Magdeburg . Milan finished seventh in Serie A . He was appointed first team coach in 1975 .\nTrapattoni was head coach for Juventus for ten consecutive years , from 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1986 . Trapattoni won all UEFA club competitions ( a European record ) .\nHe won the Serie A league title six times ( 1976–77 , 1977–78 , 1980–81 , 1981–82 , 1983–84 , 1985–86 ) , the Coppa Italia twice ( 1978–79 and 1982–83 ) , the European Cup in 1984–85 ( in a final against then-reigning champions Liverpool marked by the Heysel disaster ) , the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the Cup Winners Cup in 1983–84 , the European Super Cup in 1984 , and the UEFA Cup in 1976–77 .\nApart from winning the European Cup in 1984–85 , Trapattoni came close to conquering the trophy on another occasion , in 1982–83 , but Juventus suffered a surprising defeat at the hands of Hamburg in the Athens final , finishing as runners-up .\nDuring his years managing Juventus , Trapattoni established himself as one of the best managers in football history , well-known and respected among fans and journalists throughout Europe . He was renowned for combining expert man-management with almost unmatched tactical knowledge .\n1986–94 : Inter Milan and return to Juventus .\nTrapattoni coached Inter Milan from 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1991 . While in charge of the nerazzurri , he won the Serie A in 1988–89 , the Supercoppa Italiana in 1989 and the UEFA Cup in 1990–91 .\nHe then managed Juventus for a second time between 1991 and 1994 , winning the UEFA Cup in 1992–93 .\n1994–98 : Bayern Munich , return to Serie A , and back to Bayern Munich .\nTrapattoni became coach of Bayern Munich in the summer of 1994 , after the end of his second spell with Juventus . However , he left at the end of the 1994–95 season .\nTrapattoni coached Cagliari in the 1995–96 season . His first match was a 1–0 loss to Udinese on 26 August 1995 . The clubs board of directors decided to dismiss him in February 1996 , after a string of bad results ; Trapattoni was thus fired for the first time in his career . His final match was a 4–1 loss to Juventus . Cagliari were in 13th place at the time of his sacking .\nTrapattoni returned to manage Bayern again in July 1996 . He is well remembered by German fans for an emotional outburst in broken German during a press conference on 10 March 1998 ( Was erlauben Strunz ? .. . Ich habe fertig ! [ German uses the verb sein ( am ) and not habe ( have ) to express I have finished ] − How dare Strunz ? .. . I have finished ) where he criticised the attitude of Mehmet Scholl and Mario Basler ( Diese Spieler waren schwach wie eine Flasche leer ! − These players were weak like a bottle empty ) . In a 2011 interview , Trapattoni himself explained his famous outburst thus :\nAs Bayern manager Trapattoni won the German Bundesliga in 1996–97 , the German Cup ( DFB-Pokal ) in 1997–98 and the German League Cup ( DFB-Ligapokal ) in 1997 . He left Bayern at the end of the 1997–98 season and was replaced by Ottmar Hitzfeld .\n1998–2004 : Fiorentina and Italy national team .\nTrapattoni coached Fiorentina from 1998 to 2000 . With Trapattonis expert guidance , Fiorentina made a serious challenge for the title in 1998–99 , finishing the season in 3rd place , which earned them qualification to the Champions League , also reaching the 1999 Coppa Italia Final . The following season was rather disappointing in Serie A , with Fiorentina finishing in 7th place , but Trapattoni led them to some historic results in the Champions League , beating Arsenal 1–0 at the old Wembley Stadium and Manchester United 2–0 in Florence .\nIn July 2000 , Trapattoni took charge of the Italy national football team after the resignation of Dino Zoff . He led the team to the 2002 FIFA World Cup , qualifying undefeated to that tournament .\nPrior to the tournament , Trapattoni was surrounded by controversy after he omitted fan favourite Roberto Baggio – who had recently recovered from injury – from Italys final 23-man squad , as he believed that the player was not yet fully fit . Italy were drawn in Group G of the tournament with Ecuador , Croatia and Mexico . They won their first match , beating Ecuador 2–0 , but then suffered a surprise 2–1 defeat at the hands of Croatia . In their final group game , Italy drew 1–1 with Mexico , securing qualification to the Round of 16 with a second-place finish in their group , where they faced tournament co-hosts South Korea . Italy lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the World Cup , conceding an equaliser two minutes from full-time and losing in extra time with Ahn Jung-Hwan scoring the golden goal . The game was highly controversial with members of the Italian team , most notably Trapattoni and forward Francesco Totti , suggesting a conspiracy to eliminate Italy from the competition . Trapattoni even obliquely accused FIFA of ordering the official to ensure a South Korean victory so that one of the two host nations would remain in the tournament . The most contentious decisions were an early penalty awarded to South Korea ( saved by Gianluigi Buffon ) , a golden goal by Damiano Tommasi ruled offside , and the sending off of Totti , who received a second yellow card for an alleged dive in the penalty area , all ruled by the referee Byron Moreno . Following the teams exit , Italy were criticised in the Italian and International press for their poor performance and ultra-defensive playing style under Trapattoni , who also came under fire in the Italian media for his tactics , which included initially refusing to play two of the teams star playmakers – Alessandro Del Piero and Francesco Totti – alongside one another during the tournament , and substituting a forward – Del Piero – for a holding midfielder – Gennaro Gattuso – in the second half of Italys round of 16 match , in order to attempt to defend their 1–0 lead against South Korea .\nItaly went on to secure qualification for UEFA Euro 2004 easily , but once again failed to impress at the tournament itself . They were drawn in Group C with Denmark , Sweden and Bulgaria . They drew 0–0 with Denmark and 1–1 with Sweden , beating Bulgaria 2–1 in their final group game . This led to an unexpected early exit from the tournament , despite Italy being undefeated . Denmark and Sweden drew in the groups final match , eliminating Italy who finished in third place of Group C , on account of goal difference . More specifically , Sweden , Denmark and Italy all finished with five points , with each team having defeated Bulgaria but drawn their two other games . As all results between the three teams in question were draws , both the points won in these games and the goal difference accrued in these games still left the teams undivided . The decisive tiebreaker was therefore the goals scored during the games between one another : Italy , having scored the fewest goals of the three teams , were therefore eliminated .\nTrapattoni later said : Sweden against Denmark , I remember the game . Do you know what Johansson [ the then UEFA president Lennart Johansson ] said ? If this game finishes in a draw , we will open an investigation Do you know if he made the investigation ? Im still waiting for the investigation . These comments came eight years later , in 2012 .\nMarcello Lippi replaced Trapattoni on 15 July 2004 .\n2004–08 : Benfica , Stuttgart , and Red Bull Salzburg .\nOn 5 July 2004 , Trapattoni was named as new coach of Benfica . He led them to the 2004–05 Portuguese league title , which was the clubs first in 11 years . Benfica also reached the Portuguese Cup final that season , but lost to Vitória de Setúbal . Trapattoni resigned after the end of the 2004–05 season , saying he wanted to be closer to his family ( in the north of Italy ) .\nTrapattoni returned to management in the German Bundesliga in June 2005 , by signing at VfB Stuttgart . However , during his 20 games at the helm , Stuttgart produced poor results . Denmark internationals Jon Dahl Tomasson and Jesper Grønkjær openly criticised their coach , claiming he was afraid to attack . Trapattoni immediately responded by dropping both players to the bench . With the atmosphere in the team worsening , he was sacked after just seven months , on 9 February 2006 , reportedly for not fulfilling the ambitions of the club . He was replaced as manager by Armin Veh .\nIn May 2006 , Red Bull Salzburg announced they had signed Trapattoni as their new manager and Director of Football , along with one of his former players , Lothar Matthäus , who was to serve as Trapattonis co-manager . Trapattoni initially cast doubt on this report , claiming he had not signed any contract . But three days later , both he and Matthäus signed and made their hirings official . As he had done with Benfica in Portugal two years before , Trapattoni managed to deliver instantly , winning the league title after a long period of failures for the club ; he secured the 2006–07 Austrian Bundesliga , which was Salzburgs first in 10 years . At the end of the season , the clubs board of directors unanimously decided to dismiss Matthäus , and Thorsten Fink became Trapattonis assistant manager .\n2008–13 : Republic of Ireland .\nOn 11 February 2008 , Trapattoni agreed in principle to take over the Republic of Ireland managers job , but finished the season with Red Bull before taking up the Irish position on 1 May . Former Ireland midfielder Liam Brady was expected to be part of the Italians backroom staff , while Marco Tardelli was confirmed as Trapattonis assistant manager . Trapattoni signed Brady back in 1980 for Juventus from Arsenal for just over £500,000 . Red Bull Salzburg confirmed , on 13 February 2008 , that at the end of the 2007–08 season , Trapattoni would be leaving the club to take over as the Republic of Ireland manager . Manuela Spinelli became Trapattonis interpreter . Because of her ability to speak both Italian and English , she became a familiar sight alongside him during most interviews . She has also appeared on The Late Late Show without Trapattoni .\nTrapattonis first game in charge , a friendly against Serbia on 24 May 2008 , ended in a 1–1 draw . His second , another friendly , against Colombia five days later , meant his first victory with the national side , 1–0 . This was followed by a 1–1 draw with Norway , his first competitive win against Georgia and a draw with Montenegro in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification .\nTrapattonis first defeat came in a friendly against Poland on 19 November 2008 , a 3–2 loss at Croke Park . He also managed to claim a 1–1 away draw against 2006 FIFA World Cup champions Italy , that he had managed himself from 2000 to 2004 , thanks to a late equaliser from Robbie Keane . He finished the qualifying campaign unbeaten , becoming only the third Irish manager to do so , qualifying for a playoff place for the 2010 World Cup .\nIn September 2009 , he signed a new contract with Ireland that would have seen him continue as manager until UEFA Euro 2012 . In the first leg of the World Cup playoff in Croke Park on 14 November 2009 , France won 1–0 with a goal by Nicolas Anelka . In the second leg in Paris , on 18 November 2009 , a goal from Robbie Keane levelled the aggregate scores at 1–1 in the first half . In extra time , however , a William Gallas equaliser put France through 2–1 on aggregate . Replays of the French goal showed that Thierry Henry had twice used his hand to control the ball and was in an offside position before crossing for Gallas to head home .\nIn May 2011 , he managed Ireland as they won the Nations Cup , after a 1–0 win against Scotland . Later that year he managed the Ireland national team to UEFA Euro 2012 qualification , following a 5–1 aggregate play-off win against Estonia . Trapattoni was rewarded with a new two-year contract by the Football Association of Ireland ( FAI ) . His success was praised by , among others , Dietmar Hamann .\nIreland exited UEFA Euro 2012 at the group stage , after losing to eventual finalists Spain and Italy . Early in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification , Ireland suffered a 6–1 defeat to Germany at home with a severely depleted team available . On 29 May 2013 , Trapattonis Ireland side faced off against England for the first time in eighteen years at the Wembley Stadium in a match which ended 1–1 . Trapattoni parted ways with the Republic of Ireland national team on 11 September 2013 by mutual consent , after a defeat by Austria effectively ended their chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup .\nVatican City .\nTrapattoni has managed the Vatican City national football team which is a member of neither FIFA nor UEFA . His first match as manager was played on 23 October 2010 when Vatican City faced a team composed of Italian financial police . Previously , at the age of 71 Trapattoni was quoted as saying , When I retire , I would like to become coach of the Vatican .\nPersonal life .\nTrapattoni comes from a working-class background and lost his father as a child . A devout Roman Catholic , he regularly attends Regina Pacis Church in his hometown of Cusano Milanino whenever he is home and is a cooperator of Opus Dei . He and his wife Paola have a son and a daughter and are grandparents .\nHealth .\nIn August 2010 , Trapattoni was admitted to a hospital in Dublin , one-day before Irelands friendly with Argentina . It was initially believed that the shellfish he had eaten before arriving in the country was to blame for him feeling unwell . He underwent surgery in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital , Dublin on 11 August . He missed the Argentina game due to his surgery . In January 2011 , reports in the Italian media , claimed that he was at home recovering from a mild stroke he suffered during surgery on 28 December 2010 . The reports claimed that the stroke had caused partial paralysis on the right side of his body . In a statement released through the FAI , Trapattoni said that while he did have scheduled surgery in Italy over Christmas , he had not suffered a stroke .\nStyle of management .\nConsidered one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time , Trapattoni is highly regarded for his man-management , motivational and organisational abilities , as well as his tactical acumen , being referred to in international media as the King of Catenaccio or the Old Fox . He is known in particular for his direct management style and use of rigorous , innovative tactics , while his teams are usually known for their mental strength , organisation , and use of prepared set plays ; Trapattoni was the main author and practitioner of the zona mista style of play ( or Gioco allItaliana ) , which was regarded as an evolution of the more traditional and defensive-minded Catenaccio system , which had been popularised in Italy by one of his major influences as a manager , Nereo Rocco ; Roccos tactics mainly focussed on sitting back and defending , and subsequently scoring on counter-attacks with few touches after winning back the ball . The zona mista tactical system came to be known as such as it instead drew elements from both man-marking strategies – such as Italian catenaccio – and zonal marking systems – such as the Dutch total football ; this tactical system dominated Italian football from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , which saw the emergence of Arrigo Sacchis high-pressing , offensive minded zonal marking system .\nAlthough Trapattoni was known for his defensive minded approach as a manager , his teams often made use of a ball–playing sweeper or libero – with good technique , vision , and an ability to read the game – , who was responsible both for defending and starting attacking plays from the back , as well as a creative and skilful offensive playmaker in midfield behind the forwards . As such , his teams were known for their defensive strength and playing style , as well as their ability to score from counter-attacks . In 2014 , Trapattoni attributed his success and tactical intelligence as a manager to his time playing in midfield throughout his playing career , which allowed him to understand both the offensive and defensive phases of the game . Throughout his career , he used several different formations , including a 4–4–2 , a 4–3–1–2 , 4–2–3–1 , 3–4–1–2 , and a 3–5–2 , as well as his fluid zona mista system ; the latter system made use of a sweeper , a man-marking centre-back – or stopper – , two full-backs , a defensive midfielder , a regista or attacking midfielder , a second striker , and two wingers behind a lone striker or centre-forward , although players would often switch positions in this system , with only the stopper having a fixed role .\nTrapattoni was noted throughout his career for his ideological confrontations with more attack-minded managers he faced , most famously Johan Cruyff , a rivalry that started in their playing days , with Trapattoni remembering that , in order to stop Cruyff in a match between Italy and the Netherlands , he had to resort to dirty tactics , such as pulling at his shirt .\nTrapattonis tactics throughout his long and successful managerial career focused on some of the following themes :\n- A coach must train [ the players ] with simplicity and establish clear rules when building the team . This simplicity can be expressed through the formulation of a strategy with patterns and tactics based on the following principles : never haggle and delay excessively , pass the ball in depth to verticalise as quickly as possible , control the pace of the game , limit risks , mark behind the ball , use on-field tactical communication to help your players , be alert to the [ opposing ] teams weaknesses and strengths\n- The tactics must focus on the pressure to recover the ball and then quickly develop the offensive action\n- Ball possession isnt important in itself and sometimes it can be counter-productive like a person who talks too much . It is better to have 0% of the possession and 100% of the goals\n- Strong emphasis on training the team in set pieces and dead-ball situations\n- Instead of looking for space in the wings , as many managers do , it is more effective to look to exploit spaces behind the opposing teams backline through quick vertical play ( gioco verticale ) . By inviting the opponents pressing , the team can then easily exploit the spaces and gaps behind the opponents defence\n- The central area of the pitch , towards which statistically most of the possession is directed , needs to be very well-covered . There , the aim is to cripple the opponents game and prevail on crucial second balls , thus easily creating vertical and violent offensive transitions\n- Strikers must be trained to become clinical finishers or killers in the mould of Paolo Rossi or Filippo Inzaghi\n- Tactical discipline is necessary , but the special genius of standout players should also be encouraged and harnessed to the fullest , with Trapattoni citing his use of Michel Platini and Roberto Baggio as primary examples\nTrapattoni is also a popular figure in Italy for his original press conference speeches and trademark quotes , one of the most famous being dont say cat until youve got it in the bag . During his managerial stints abroad , his sense of humour , coupled with his difficulties with the local language , won him a significant amount of popularity with both fans and the press . His most memorable press conference took place while he was in charge of German club Bayern Munich . In a speech riddled with grammar mistakes and involuntary neologisms , most famously using Ich habe fertig ( roughly translatable as I have finished , in place of I am finished ) and Schwach wie eine Flasche leer ( weak like a bottle empty ) , he soundly attacked many of his players , including Thomas Strunz , whose last name , in Trapattonis native Lombard language , is a swear word roughly equivalent to asshole .\nHe is also known for a two-fingered whistle he used to capture the attention of his players during games . He also brought a bottle of holy water during 2002 FIFA World Cup games when he was in charge of the Italy national team . He kept the same tradition while in charge of Benfica .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\nClub .\nMilan\n- Serie A : 1961–62 , 1967–68\n- Coppa Italia : 1966–67\n- European Cup : 1962–63 , 1968–69\n- European Cup Winners Cup : 1967–68\nManager .\nClub .\nJuventus\n- Serie A : 1976–77 , 1977–78 , 1980–81 , 1981–82 , 1983–84 , 1985–86\n- Coppa Italia : 1978–79 , 1982–83\n- European Cup : 1984–85\n- UEFA Cup Winners Cup : 1983–84\n- UEFA Cup : 1976–77 , 1992–93\n- European Super Cup : 1984\n- Intercontinental Cup : 1985\nInter\n- Serie A : 1988–89\n- Supercoppa Italiana : 1989\n- UEFA Cup : 1990–91\nBayern Munich\n- Bundesliga : 1996–97\n- DFB-Pokal : 1997–98\n- DFB-Ligapokal : 1997\nBenfica\n- Primeira Liga : 2004–05\nRed Bull Salzburg\n- Austrian Bundesliga : 2006–07\nInternational .\nRepublic of Ireland\n- Nations Cup : 2011\nIndividual .\n- A.C .

    "story": "Hemma\nEmma of Altdorf , also known as Hemma ( – 31 January 876 ) , a member of the Elder House of Welf , was Queen consort of East Francia by marriage to King Louis the German , from 843 until her death .\nLife .\nHer father was Welf I ( d . 825 ) , Count of Altorf in Alamannia ; her mother was Hedwig ( Heilwig ; c . 775 – after 833 ) , a daughter of the Saxon count Isambart . Emmas elder sister was Judith , who in February 819 married the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious , and thereby became Queen consort of the Franks and Holy Roman Empress . The marriage marked a crucial step forward in the rise of the Welf dynasty .\nIn 827 , probably at the instigation of Judith , Hemma married Louis the German , the youngest son of Emperor Louis the Pious from his first marriage with Ermengarde of Hesbaye , and stepson of Hemmas sister Judith . The wedding ceremony possibly took place in Regensburg , where Louis the German resided as King of Bavaria subordinate to his father . In 833 , Hemma received Obermünster Abbey in Regensburg from her husband .\nEmperor Louis died in 840 . After severe innerdynastic struggles , the Carolingian Empire eventually was divided according to the Treaty of Verdun in 843 . The Kingdom of Bavaria was merged with Louis the Germans Kingdom of East Francia ( the predecessor of the Kingdom of Germany ) , and his wife Hemma became the first East Frankish queen .\nHemma is rarely mentioned in contemporary sources ; she does not seem to have had much influence on her husbands rule . The Annales Bertiniani written by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims however reproach her for a pride which displeased the people of Italy . She is also said to have inordinately favoured her son Carloman , designated heir of his father in Bavaria , which led to a revolt by his brothers .\nHemma suffered a stroke in 874 and subsequently became paralyzed and speechless ; King Louis visited her the last time in 875 . She died on 31 January 876 , a few months before her husband , and was buried in St . Emmerams Abbey , Regensburg . Her tomb , erected around 1300 , is considered a masterpiece of medieval sculpture .\nFamily .\nBy Louis , she had eight children :\n- Hildegard ( 827–856 )\n- Carloman ( 828–880 )\n- Ermengard ( c . 830-866 )\n- Gisela , married to Berctolf , Count of Swabia .

Milledge was a founder of Athens , Georgia , and the University of Georgia .\nRevolutionary War .\nJohn Milledge was born in Savannah , the grandson of an original settler of Georgia . He was tutored privately and studied law . After being admitted to the bar , he opened a law practice in Savannah . At the onset of the Revolutionary War , Milledge was part of a group that took colonial governor Sir James Wright as a prisoner in 1775 . He also took part in a raid of Savannahs royal armory to procure gunpowder for the revolutionary cause . When the British captured Savannah , Milledge escaped to South Carolina , where American patriots nearly hanged him as a spy . He participated in the Siege of Savannah in an attempt to drive the British forces out .

He won the Danish Cup with AGF Aarhus and played in England for top level teams Ipswich Town and Everton , as well as Wolfsburg in Germany . He played 20 matches for the Danish national team , and represented Denmark at the 1992 Summer Olympics and 1996 European Championship .\nLife and career .\nBorn in Aarhus , Thomsen started his career at local top-flight club AGF Aarhus , where he initially played as a midfielder . Thomsen made his debut for the Danish under-21 national team in May 1989 , where under-21 national team coach Richard Møller Nielsen used the 6 3 Thomsen as a central defender . Thomsen was named under-21 national team captain in 1990 . In December 1990 , Thomsen signed a new contract with AGF , rejecting interest from Brøndby IF and B1903 .\nIn November 1991 , Thomsen was scouted by Celtic FC manager Liam Brady , but the deal fell through due to too many intermediaries according to Claus Thomsen himself . He was injured in an under-21 national game against Poland in March 1992 , but recovered in time to help AGF win the 1992 Danish Cup . He also captained Denmark at the 1992 Summer Olympics , where he played all three of Denmarks matches , and scored a goal against Mexico . In the fall of 1992 , he lost his place in the central defence in AGFs starting line-up , and he was used in a number of different positions . He went on trial at Werder Bremen in December 1992 , but was not signed by Werder manager Otto Rehhagel .\nIpswich Town .\nIn June 1994 , he moved abroad to play for English club Ipswich Town , in a transfer deal worth £250,000 . He was called up for his Danish national team début , by national coach Richard Møller Nielsen , in April 1995 . Thomsen was also called up to the Danish national squad for the 1996 European Championship , and played in all of Denmarks three matches before elimination . He made a total 97 appearances and scored 8 goals for Ipswich , and was one of the stronger players in the weakest side in Ipswich Towns history . In his first season , he was relegated with Ipswich in 1994/95 , and was a key player in the team that missed out on the First Division play-offs in 1995–96 ; however , as Ipswich were looking to improve their side , he was sold to Everton , for £900,000 , in January 1997 .\nEverton .\nAt Everton , Thomsen notably scored an own goal in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on 16 April 1997 , meaning that Everton were held to a 1–1 draw by Liverpool , although they still achieved Premier League survival in 15th place .

    "story": "Therese Sjögran\nKerstin Ingrid Therese Sjögran ( born 8 April 1977 ) is a Swedish football manager and coach , and former player as a midfielder for Damallsvenskan club FC Rosengård and the Sweden womens national football team . A modern pioneer and source of inspiration in womens football , she is considered one of the greatest Swedish footballers of all time and imagined by some as a possible future head coach for the national team . Nicknamed Terre , Sjögran made her first Damallsvenskan appearances for Kristianstad/Wä DFF . She joined Malmö FF Dam in 2001 and remained with the club through its different guises as LdB FC and FC Rosengård . Sjögran spent the 2011 season with American Womens Professional Soccer ( WPS ) club Sky Blue FC .\nSwedens all-time record appearance holder , Sjögran is the first player to win 200 caps for Blågult and is tied with Birgit Prinz at 214 for the most capped European footballer in national teams . She made her national team debut in October 1997 and represented her country in the 2001 , 2005 , 2009 and 2013 editions of the UEFA Womens Championship , as well as at the 2003 , 2007 , 2011 and 2015 FIFA Womens World Cups . She also played at the 2000 , 2004 and 2008 Olympic Football Tournaments , but missed out in 2012 due to injury . Sjögran twice won the Diamantbollen , the award for Swedens female player of the year , in 2007 and 2010 .\nToday she is sporting director in FC Rosengård .\nClub career .\nSjögran began playing football with boys at Harlösa IF and moved on to Veberöds AIF at the age of 12 . She has mentioned on several occasions as an adult that Jürgen Klinsmann was her greatest inspiration , whom she first saw in the 1990 World Cup . Aged 14 , she was already playing for Veberöds womens team in Division 3 . After signing for Division 1 club Wä IF in 1997 Sjögran was part of the team promoted into the Damallsvenskan for the first time that year . She came to the attention of bigger clubs and joined Wäs local rivals Malmö FF Dam in 2001 .\nMalmö showed good form but were prevented from winning trophies by the dominant Umeå IK team of the era . With Sjögran playing as a left winger , the 2003 Svenska Cupen final finished Umeå 1–0 Malmö , after an extra time goal by Umeås Hanna Ljungberg . In April 2005 , Sjögran rejected advances from several rival clubs to extend her Malmö contract .\nConsistent performances from Sjögran at Malmö saw her honoured as Swedens female Midfielder of the Year in 2007 and 2008 . In 2007 , she won the Diamantbollen award for the best female footballer in the country .\nIn March 2009 , Sjögran indicated her interest in playing in the English FA WSL , which was supposed to start the following year but was delayed . Later in 2009 , she was picked in the American Womens Professional Soccer ( WPS ) International Draft by Atlanta Beat , but remained loyal to Malmö .\nInspired by 33-year-old Sjögran , Malmö won their first Damallsvenskan championship since 1994 in the 2010 season . It was delighted Sjögrans first league winners medal after finishing in second place on five previous occasions . Sjögran won the Diamantbollen again in 2010 . Her acceptance speech paid tribute to the influence of her step-father . A surprised Sjögran had expected Charlotte Rohlin to win the award .\nIn December 2010 Malmö let Sjögran move to America , with WPS club Sky Blue FC . Sky Blue coach Jim Gabarra had made Sjögran one of his top transfer targets , describing her as consistently exceptional . Sjögran played just 13 matches for Sky Blue , as the 2011 FIFA Womens World Cup was scheduled during the 2011 season . Starting 12 of the games , she posted six assists as Sky Blue finished fifth of six teams .\nThe deal had a clause that Sjögran would return to Malmö after the short American season . She helped Malmö retain their Damallsvenskan title in 2011 and represented the club in the 2011–12 UEFA Womens Champions League .\nAfter a serious knee injury in May 2012 , veteran Sjögran eventually returned to full fitness but found it difficult to break back into the starting line-up as Malmö were battling rivals Tyresö FF for the league title . Strong performances for the Swedish national team saw her win back her club place . Malmö and Sjögran won their third title in four seasons in 2013 . She was happy to secure her third league winners medal in October 2013 , as Malmö beat Umeå IK 2–0 to take an unassailable six point lead over Tyresö at the top of the table .\nSjögran signed a new contract with Malmö , now known as FC Rosengård , in May 2014 . She wanted to remain with the club for the rest of her playing career . In June 2014 she was linked with a coaching role at the club . Sjögran helped Rosengård defend their title in 2014 .\nOn 28 April 2015 Rosengård announced that Sjögran had been appointed as the clubs next sporting director , starting 1 August , replacing Erling Nilsson ( who would remain in the club as a mentor ) and that she intended to retire from playing after the summers World Cup in Canada . On 21 May 2015 Sjögran played what seemed to be her final league game , but she didnt want to celebrate then . It was reported in July 2015 that Sjögran would play her 426th and final game for the club in their Svenska Cupen semi-final against Umeå . She was thanked and celebrated right before and after that match .\nOn the 20 July Therese Sjögran hastily took over as head coach , meant temporarily , after Markus Tilly went on sick leave for family reasons . She didnt like it much .\nShortly after , with Rosengård suffering a dip in form , having several players injured and star player Anja Mittag recently left the club , and locked in a title challenge with Eskilstuna United , Sjögran was pressed into another hastily endeavor , making a temporary playing comeback on 26 July despite having said just a few days earlier that she would not do so . On 1 August Rosengård announced they had signed with a new head coach , thus relieving Sjögran . Sjögran stepped in and played once more 5 August against Eskilstuna and on 9 August 2015 , in the Svenska Cupen final against Linköping , a game Rosengård lost , this time promising it would definitely be her last time .\nIn the league Rosengård overcame the absence of coach Markus Tilly and the departure of star players Anja Mittag and Ramona Bachmann to secure their third successive title , with a final day 5–0 win over Linköpings FC .\nSjögran disclosed in an interview about a childrens book based on her youth years , Rött kort , Therese! , that the only time she received a red card was in Veberöd after having practiced lately on sliding and tried to execute that in a match with bad result .\nSjögran made another temporary playing comeback on 7 February 2016 in a friendly against Manchester City , as FC Rosengård suffered many sick and injured players , but she was only in the technical area as a substitute and never actually played .\nInternational career .\nSjögran made her first appearance for the senior Swedish national team on 30 October 1997 ; a 3–1 friendly defeat by the United States in Chattanooga , Tennessee . She was fast-tracked into the national team by coach Marika Domanski-Lyfors although she had not yet played in Swedens top division . After some injury problems kept her out of club football , Sjögran was not selected for the 1999 FIFA Womens World Cup in the United States . She returned to the squad for the 2000 Sydney Olympics , but was mainly an understudy and was restricted to substitute appearances as Sweden crashed out in the first round .\nSjögran was a more established first team player by the time of UEFA Womens Euro 2001 . She came on as a substitute in all Swedens games except the final , which she started . Sweden lost 1–0 to Claudia Müllers golden goal for hosts Germany .\nAt the 2003 FIFA Womens World Cup , Sjögran was substituted at half-time in Swedens first match , a 3–1 loss to hosts the United States . She came on as a substitute in Swedens remaining matches and won praise for her performance in the final , which Sweden again lost to Germany on a golden goal . In its tournament review , the Expressen newspaper described Sjögran as a talented enigma who seemed incapable of translating her best performances to the international stage .\nFollowing the retirement of midfield star Malin Moström in late 2006 , Sjögran was given a more prominent role by coach Thomas Dennerby . As part of the Sweden team surprisingly eliminated in the first round of the 2007 FIFA Womens World Cup , Sjögran was one of few Swedish players to emerge with any credit from the tournament . She also played a leading role as Sweden beat rivals Denmark in a qualification play-off for the following years Olympics . In China 2008 she participated in the Swedes 2–0 quarter-final defeat by Germany .\nAt the 2011 Algarve Cup Sjögran surpassed Victoria Sandell Svenssons national record of 166 caps , after playing in a 2–1 defeat to Japan . She marked the occasion by scoring her 17th international goal , direct from a free kick .\nExperienced elder stateswoman Sjögran helped Sweden achieve third place at the 2011 FIFA Womens World Cup in Germany . She assisted Lisa Dahlqvists winning goal against North Korea in the group stage , and started Swedens 3–1 semi-final defeat to eventual winners Japan in Frankfurt . Sjögran played the whole match as Sweden secured third place by beating France 2–1 in Sinsheim .\nThird place ensured Swedens qualification for the 2012 Olympic football tournament in London . In May 2012 , Sjögran tore her anterior cruciate ligament and was ruled out of the Olympics . Although she was aged 35 , Sjögran did not consider retirement . She aimed to recover in time for UEFA Womens Euro 2013 , which Sweden were hosting .\nIncoming coach Pia Sundhage selected Sjögran in the Sweden squad for Euro 2013 , admitting it was something of a gamble and demanding that Sjögran should expend the last drop of sweat to justify her place . Sjögran had not expected to be recalled and had even purchased tickets to attend the tournament as a supporter . At the final tournament Sjögran made substitute appearances in the 3–1 group win over Italy and the 1–0 defeat by Germany in the semi-final . Team-mate Lotta Schelin praised Sjögrans contribution , describing her as an old gem .\nIn November 2013 , the Swedish Football Association ( SvFF ) sparked a sexism scandal at its annual awards Fotbollsgalan when it presented Anders Svensson with a Volvo XC60 car for winning 146 caps . SvFF was widely criticised for failing to honour Sjögran , who had 187 caps . Afterwards SvFF claimed that they had planned to reward and celebrate Sjögran at a later occasion , but failed to properly inform internally . Chairman Karl-Erik Nilsson later regretted the decision , saying it would have been better if they paid tribute to Sjögran as well . Car manufacturers Peugeot and Citroën voluntarily on their own initiative offered to lend one of their newest models to Sjögran .\nCoach Sundhage continued to select Sjögran for Swedens successful 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup qualification campaign . She played alongside Lotta Schelin as a forward against Northern Ireland in Växjö , deputising for the injured Kosovare Asllani , a move that surprised some , as older players tend to get moved backward a bit and have a more defensive role . She scored the first goal . That was her 193rd game in the national team . In October 2014 Sjögran reached her 200th appearance for Sweden , in a 2–1 home friendly defeat by Germany . She became the first Swedish player to achieve the milestone and only the third European after Birgit Prinz and Katrine Pedersen .\nIn November 2014 , SvFF again sparked a sexism scandal involving Therese Sjögran at Fotbollsgalan , this time in conjunction with TV4 . There was a celebration planned and prepared for the ceremony for her achieving 200 caps , but it was cancelled in the middle of the show before it occurred because of time constraints .\nAt the 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup , Sjögran made her 214th and final appearance in Swedens 4–1 round of 16 defeat by Germany , putting her in split first place with Birgit Prinz for most capped European footballer in national teams .\nShe left the field with tears in her eyes and kept the match ball as a souvenir for her mother . Afterwards she felt empty and woeful having exited and quit that way with a heavy loss .\nBefore Fotbollsgalan 2015 Sjögran said she didnt want to be honoured this time , as she thought it was too late . But SvFF kept their plan and this time actually followed it though , rewarding her with Fotbollskanalens hederspris , The Football Channels honorary award .\nManagement career .\nSince 1 August 2015 Sjögran is sporting director in FC Rosengård .\nPersonal life .\nIn an interview made in 2005 before the European Championship Sjögran states that she would choose innebandy if she wouldnt play football . Her favourite food was shellfish , her favourite music was techno/house and her favourite movie was Saw . She thought Birgit Prinz was the best current player and that golfer Annika Sörenstam was the best Swedish athlete of all time . In a short interview made in 2013 she also mentioned table tennis as a secondary sports choice .\nEconomics graduate Sjögran took legal action when she was refused unemployment benefit on the grounds that her football career stopped her being available for work . She later worked part-time for the insurance company , Trygg-Hansa .\nSports journalist Anja Gatu wrote a fictional biographical childrens book , with illustrations by Maria Borgelöv , about Sjögrans early years in Harlösa IF titled Rött kort , Therese ! ( Red card , Therese! ) in 2015 . One and a half year later Gatu wrote a sequel titled Snygg fint , Therese ! ( Nice feint , Therese! ) .\nSjögran participated in SVTs 2017 season of Mästarnas mästare which was recorded in Algarve , Portugal in September 2016 . She was once again miscredited for her deeds as SVT in a press release before a press gathering for the show had left out most of her merits and claimed that Anders Svensson was the most capped Swedish player . The car incident from Fotbollsgalan was supposedly brought up during recording of her recap in the show , but was ultimately cut from the broadcast .\nShe still played football regularly in 2016 , but only in Swedish amateur league Korpen .\nHonours and merits .\nClub .\n- Veberöds AIF\n- Division 3 : Winner 1994\n- Wä FF\n- Division 1 ( 1 ) : Winner 1997\n- LdB FC Malmö/FC Rosengård\n- Damallsvenskan : Winner 2010 , 2011 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015\n- Svenska Supercupen : Winner 2011 , 2012 , 2015\nInternational .\n- Sweden\n- 2003 FIFA Womens World Cup : Runner-up\n- 2007 FIFA Womens World Cup : Group stage\n- 2011 FIFA Womens World Cup : Third place\n- 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup : Round of 16\n- 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney : Group stage\n- 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens : Fourth place\n- 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing : Quarter-final\n- UEFA Womens Euro 2001 : Runner-up\n- UEFA Womens Euro 2005 : Semi-finals\n- UEFA Womens Euro 2009 : Quarter-final\n- UEFA Womens Euro 2013 : Semi-finals\n- Algarve Cup ( Participated from 1998 to 2015 ) : Winner 2001 , 2009\n- Four Nations Tournament : Fourth Place 1998 , Third Place 2004 , Third Place 2011\n- Australia Cup : Winner 2003\nIndividual .\n- Diamantbollen : Best female player in Sweden 2007\n- Best female midfielder in Sweden 2007\n- Best female midfielder in Sweden 2008\n- Diamantbollen : Best female player in Sweden 2010\n- Soccer Channel special prize 2015\nReferences .\n- Match reports\nExternal links .\n- Sjögran Interview\n- Video interview Swedish midfielders Therese Sjögran and Caroline Seger in 2015 Algarve Cup by SOCCER.COM on YouTube\n- Article with a dozen of historical images of Sjögran by Sportbladet/Aftonbladet .\n- Video of the press conference of Sjögrans plans to quit playing and become sporting director by Sydsvenskan on YouTube .\n- Sjögran receives Fotbollskanalens Hederspris by TV4 Sport on YouTube .\n- Interview in her role as sporting director .

    "story": "Alexandra Biriukova\nAlexandra Biriukova ( July 10 , 1895 - February 10 , 1967 ) was a Canadian architect and nurse . She is known for being the first woman in the Ontario Association of Architects and for her design of Lawren Harriss residence . She was the second woman to register as an architect in Canada .\nBiography .\nBiriukova was born in Vladivostok , Russia . Her father was Dimiti Biriukoff , who was the chief civil engineer on the first trans-Siberian railway . In 1911 , Biriukova studied architecture and received a degree from the School of Architecture in Petrograd .\nIn 1914 , during the Russian Revolution , she and her family left the country and moved to Rome . In 1925 , in Rome , she received a post-graduate degree in architecture from the Royal Superior School of Architecture . Between 1924 and 1929 , she worked in Rome for architect Arnoldo Foschini . In 1929 she moved again to Toronto where her sister , Yulia Biriukova , an artist , lived . She registered with the Ontario Association of Architects ( OAA ) in 1931 .\nWork .\nIn Toronto , her first commission is believed to be an interior design for a Russian Orthodox Church . However , Biriukovas most recognized work is the Lawren Harris residence , which was designed in the Art Deco style and is one of the few homes to be built in Toronto along avant garde lines . Construction on the home , located at 2 Ava Crescent in Forest Hill , began in 1931 . The house is symmetrical , smooth and made up of almost austere two- and three-storey masses . While the designs for the house had initially been prepared by Douglas Kertland , she reworked the designs at Harriss request and she is credited for all of the final design work . Biriukovas design was considered radical for the time . At first , the Harris home received a negative critical reception from contemporaries . However , today , the building continues to be recognized : the OAA named it one of the top ten Art Deco Buildings in Toronto .\nBiriukova has not been well recognized in art history due to architectural historians who have tried to diminish the role she played in the design of Harriss well-known house . Even though she was named as architect on the contract drawings , some historians have questioned how much credit Biriukova should receive for this elegant and iconic house . Geoffrey Simmins , an art historian from the University of Calgary , asserted , with little evidence , that Harris instead may have influenced most of the homes design , saying , Certainly the houses geometric plan and clear , axial sequence of spaces...accord with Harriss own interests . Cynthia Hammond calls such readings of Biriukovas work troubling narratives which are loaded with gendered assumptions .\nIt seems likely that Biriukova , coming from Europe , would have already been aware of the avant-garde , pre-revolution Russian architects and the modernist designs coming from the Bauhaus School , and her design reflected the emerging early international style emanating from Europe . Harris had been to Europe prior to building his house and had consciously sought European precedents for the design of his home .\nAfter her work on Harriss house , she received no further commissions . Other architectural historians , like Ayla Lepine , have wondered if Modernism was too much for conservative Canadians , or if the Depression dried up opportunities for architects , or if it was because she was a Russian woman . The Depression most likely created a dearth of work .\nLater life .\nIn 1934 , Biriukova registered as a nurse and never practiced as an architect again . Instead , she worked at the Free Toronto Hospital for the Consumptive Poor until she retired in the 1960s . Biriukova died in Toronto in 1967 .\nExternal links .\n- Image of Harris house",

His patrilineal great-grandfather had emigrated from Germany to England during the 19th century . He also has a distant Huguenot ancestor . His family was working-class , and Jacobi describes his childhood as happy . In his teens he went to Leyton County High School for Boys , now known as the Leyton Sixth Form College , and became an integral part of the drama club , The Players of Leyton .\nWhile in the sixth form , he starred in a production of Hamlet , which was taken to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and very well regarded . At 18 he won a scholarship to the University of Cambridge , where he read history at St Johns College and earned his degree . Younger members of the university at the time included Ian McKellen ( who had a crush on him—a passion that was undeclared and unrequited , as McKellen relates it ) and Trevor Nunn .

He played Nells grandfather in ITVs Christmas 2007 adaptation of The Old Curiosity Shop , and returned to the stage to play Malvolio in Shakespeares Twelfth Night ( 2009 ) for the Donmar Warehouse at Wyndhams Theatre in London .

    "story": "USA Sevens\nThe USA Sevens is a rugby sevens tournament held annually during March in the United States . The USA Sevens is the largest annual rugby competition in North America , drawing over 60,000 fans , and is broadcast live in the United States by ESPN . The USA Sevens was introduced in 2004 , originally in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson , California . The event moved to San Diego in 2007 , and from there moved to Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas in 2010 . It then spent the entire decade of the 2010s in Las Vegas before returning to Carson in 2020 . The USA Sevens tournament features 16 teams representing countries from every inhabited continent , including the host , the U.S . national team .\nThe USA Sevens is the fifth of ten tournaments on the World Rugby Sevens Series . The Sevens World Series is played throughout the world at nine other venues : Dubai , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Hong Kong , Singapore , Canada , France , and England .\nFormat .\nThe tournament consists of 16 countries participating in 45 matches over a three-day weekend . The 16 teams are divided into four pools of four teams , with seeding determined by finishes in the previous competition in the Sevens World Series . Wins are worth three points , draws two , and losses one . The top two teams from each group progress to the quarterfinals to compete for the Cup ( places 1-4 ) and Plate ( places 5-8 ) . The bottom two teams from each group participate in the Bowl ( places 9-12 ) and Shield ( places 13-16 ) competitions .\nThrough the 2011–12 edition , the sixteen participating teams were the 12 core members of the Sevens World Series circuit , along with 4 additional qualifying teams—other teams that qualified multiple times during the 2009–2012 span included Japan , Canada , Uruguay and Guyana . Starting with the 2012–13 season , the number of core teams increased from 12 to 15 , with Canada , Spain and Portugal earning the three new slots .\nPopularity and Growth .\nThe USA Sevens is the 2nd largest annual rugby competition in North America after the Vancouver 7s in Canada The tournament has grown in popularity since the tournament began in 2004 . In recent years , a number of events have accelerated the surge in popularity , including the announcement in 2009 that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics , the general growth of rugby in the United States , the improved performance of the U.S . national rugby team including their success in reaching the semi-finals of the 2009 USA Sevens , and NBCs decision to begin televising the tournament beginning in 2011 .\nAttendance .\nTournament attendance has grown rapidly since its inception in 2004 . The tournament drew 15,800 fans in 2004 , 25,000 fans in 2007 , 35,773 in 2008 , and 37,000 fans in 2009 .\nThe tournament switched to a three-day format in 2011 . The 2012 tournaments second-day attendance of 30,112 set a new record for the largest crowd to watch a rugby event in the United States . The 2013 tournament broke attendance records again , with total attendance of 67,341 . The 2014 tournament again saw record attendance , with 68,608 fans , despite the fact that the tournament had been moved to January to avoid the 2014 Winter Olympics .\nMedia coverage .\nThe profile and visibility of the USA Sevens has increased in the United States since NBC began broadcasting the tournament in 2011 , marking the first time that the tournament had live television coverage on network TV in the United States . NBC Sports and Universal Sports broadcast eight hours of live coverage of the 2011 tournament , including 4 hours of coverage on NBC . NBC increased its television coverage for the 2012 tournament , showing 10 hours of live coverage , including 4 hours on NBC and 4 hours on NBC Sports . The 2012 USA Sevens earned strong ratings of 0.7 on NBC , beating other popular sports events that weekend such as the Detroit v . Philadelphia NHL game ( 0.4 ) and the Alabama v . LSU basketball game ( 0.3 ) . NBC again increased its TV coverage in 2013 , with 16 hours of coverage across three channels , including 4 hours on NBC and 6 hours on NBC Sports . The 2014 USA Sevens drew ratings of 0.7 on Saturday and 1.0 on Sunday . The 2016 USA Sevens had 7 hours of TV coverage across NBCSN and NBC , but only 1 hour on NBC .\nNBC Sports has displayed an increased interest in broadcasting rugby since the International Olympic Committees announcement in 2009 that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics in 2016 . NBC Sports has recognized that its partnership with USA Sevens to broadcast the tournament will help grow the sport of rugby in the United States .\nSponsors .\nFueled in part by the publicity generated by the NBC broadcasts and rugbys return to the Olympics , the USA Sevens has been successful in lining up several blue-chip corporate sponsors . For the 2011 tournament , sponsors included Bridgestone , Toyota , Subway and ADT . The tournament was similarly successful in landing commercial sponsors for 2012 , including Adidas , Pepsi , DHL , Subway and others .\nEffective with the 2010–11 series , the London-based global financial services company HSBC became the title sponsor of the overall IRB Sevens World Series .\nHistory .\nThe USA Sevens tournament has been a part of the World Rugby Sevens Series every year since its 2004 debut . This makes the USA Sevens tournament one of the longer running consecutive hosts on the circuit .\nThe USA Sevens debuted at the Home Depot Center , now known as Dignity Health Sports Park , in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson , California in February 2004 . This competition marked the first time the United States ever hosted an official IRB event of international importance . USA Rugby was awarded the right to host the USA Sevens for three years , in part because rugby was recognized as one of the fastest growing team sports in the U.S .\nIn 2005 , USA Rugby sold a 90% interest in USA Sevens , LLC to United World Sports , LLC , with USA Rugby retaining the remaining 10% ownership interest . In August 2006 , USA Rugby and the International Rugby Board renewed the contract for the USA Sevens to remain in the IRB Sevens World Series .\nThe USA Sevens tournament was held from 2007 to 2009 in San Diego at Petco Park , the home field of the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball . San Diego was an appealing location because the average high temperature in San Diego in February is a balmy 72 °F ( 22 °C ) .\nLas Vegas then won the right to host the annual event beginning in 2010 , beating out competition from San Francisco , Phoenix , and Orlando . In 2015 , World Rugby reached an agreement with USA Rugby and with the tournaments organizers : World Rugby would continue to place the USA Sevens tournament in Las Vegas if the tournament organizers agreed to widen the field at Sam Boyd Stadium and install approved artificial turf .\nThe USA Sevens was a financial success during its run in Las Vegas , partly because its venue of Sam Boyd Stadium was surrounded by playing fields . This allowed the complex to host the Las Vegas Invitational , a major rugby union event involving club , school , and university teams , alongside the USA Sevens . During the USA Sevens run in Las Vegas , the entry fee for the Invitational has included tickets to the USA Sevens , providing a large built-in attendance base .\nIn 2017 , the Oakland Raiders were given permission by the NFL to relocate to Las Vegas , with the team to play in a new 60,000-capacity stadium on a plot of derelict land near the Las Vegas Strip . Due to the fact that $750 million of the construction costs was expected to come in the form of public funding , a deal was thrashed out to allow the UNLV Rebels football team of the local University of Nevada , Las Vegas to move in as co-tenants of the new stadium . This meant that Sam Boyd Stadium faces an uncertain future with multiple sources suggesting that it would be demolished . In March 2018 , United World Sports CEO Jon Prusmack stated his intention on initiating talks with the Raiders over the next few months to allow the USA Sevens to use the new Raiders stadium for future tournaments .\nIn January 2019 , The Province , the main newspaper in Vancouver , reported that the then-upcoming 2019 USA Sevens would be the last in Las Vegas , at least for the immediate future . At the time , World Rugby was preparing to announce the hosts for the Sevens Series events for its next four-year cycle , starting with 2019–20 and running through 2022–23 . Reasons cited were stadium issues and poor living environment at the team hotels . Possible options were a return to San Diego , or moves to San Francisco ( which hosted the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens ) or Miami . WR ultimately announced that the event would return to its original home of Dignity Health Sports Park for at least the 2020 event .\nApart from the uncertain future of Sam Boyd Stadium , its playing field had been the source of many issues . During the first years of the events run in Las Vegas , the stadiums standard artificial pitch was used , leading to many safety-related concerns . Some of these concerns were alleviated with the installation of temporary grass surfaces for the 2017–2019 events , but other safety issues inherent to the stadiums design remained . Sam Boyd Stadium was built for American football , a sport with a playing field ( including the end zones ) that is approximately the same length as a standard rugby pitch but is nearly 20 meters narrower . Because of this , the pitch in Las Vegas was noticeably narrower than at other series stops , with team benches unusually close to the touchlines .\nResults .\nResults by year .\nSources : USA Sevens , Rugby7\nResults by team .\nUpdated to include the 2020 tournamenent :",

    "story": "Richard Spooner ( MP )\nRichard Spooner ( 28 July 1783 – 24 November 1864 ) was a British businessman and politician . In his youth he was a Radical reformer , but in later life he moved to the political right to become an Ultra-Tory .\nEarly life and family .\nSpooner was born at Birches Green , Erdington , and was the son of Isaac Spooner , a banker and magistrate in nearby Birmingham . Following education at Rugby School , he joined a banking company , where he was in partnership with Thomas Attwood . In 1804 he married Charlotte Wetherell , daughter of Nathan Wetherell , the Dean of Hereford . He was involved in the civic life of Birmingham , helping to found the Mechanics Institute in 1820 , of which he was the first president .\nRadical politics .\nIn 1812 Spooner and Attwood led a campaign to repeal the orders in council introduced in 1807 as part of the governments campaign of economic warfare against France . The orders , which severely effected the trade of Birmingham were repealed later in the year .\nIn March 1820 he contested the general election at Boroughbridge , Yorkshire . The constituency was a two-seat pocket borough in the hands of the Dukes of Newcastle , who supported the Tory candidates . However , Spooner , running as a Radical , and Marmaduke Lawson , a Whig were elected . Three months later , the Tories managed to have the election of both MPs overturned on petition .\nIn 1826 Spooner again stood for parliament at Warwickshire . While he had overwhelming support from the voters of Birmingham , he was unsuccessful . In December of the same year a parliamentary vacancy was caused , when Richard Ironmonger MP for Stafford died . Spooner was chosen as the Radical candidate to contest the ensuing by-election , but was defeated in a straight fight by the Whig , Thomas Beaumont . He was expected to contest the seat again at the next general election in 1830 . Instead he stood at Coventry , where his colleague Attwood had been requested to stand , but had declined . Once again , he failed to be elected .\nMove to the Tories .\nBy 1832 Spooners repeated electoral defeats led to his moving away from Radical politics . In that year he was asked to join the Birmingham Political Union , but declined the invitation . By the time of the 1835 general election he had made a complete change in his political views . The Birmingham Daily Post described his conversion :\n...from having been a bold and uncompromising Liberal , became ultimately one of the most determined , immovable and obstructive members of the ultra-Tory party .\nMember of parliament for Birmingham .\nIn 1835 and 1841 Spooner stood as the Tory candidate against Birminghams sitting Radical MPs . He was heavily defeated on both occasions . In 1844 , Joshua Scholefield , one of the towns members of parliament , died . Consequently , a by-election was held . Spooner was again the Tory candidate and was opposed by William Scholefield , son of the deceased MP , who was expected to hold the seat for the Radicals . However , the Liberal/Radical vote was split when a third candidate , Joseph Sturge , entered the contest . Spooner was elected most likely to his own astonishment as the first Tory MP for Birmingham . It was noted that the personal liking felt for the man was temporarily permitted to outweigh the general resentment at his political apostasy . At the next general election in 1847 the Liberals were reunited , and Spooner lost the seat to William Scholefield .\nMember of parliament for North Warwickshire .\nHaving lost his seat at Birmingham in July 1847 , Spooner was immediately nominated as a Conservative candidate for the two-member Northern Division of Warwickshire where polling was not held until August . On 16 August he was duly declared elected , along with his party colleague , Charles Newdigate Newdegate . He held the seat at the general elections of 1852 , 1857 and 1859 .\nSpooner was a member of the Ultra faction of the Tories . He was a proponent of protectionism and a strong Anglican , opposing any measures of relief to Roman Catholics , Dissenters or Jews . In his later years he was considered a figure of fun , with his annual ( and barely audible ) speech denouncing the renewal of the grant to Maynooth Seminary treated with derision . In his obituary his later parliamentary contributions were summarised :\n...every proposal which in his early life would have elicited his most strenuous approval , received in his old age his most vehement opposition .\nIn 1862 he became unwell , and ceased attending the Commons . He delayed his resignation as the local Conservative organisation had no agreed candidate in the event of a vacancy . He lived in virtual retirement at Henwood Lodge , Leamington Spa , where he died in November 1864 . He was buried in the family vault at Elmdon .",

    "story": "Media Watch ( TV program )\nMedia Watch is an Australian media analysis television program currently presented by Paul Barry for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) . The program focuses on critiquing the Australian media together with interconnections including political .\nIn 1999 , Media Watch played a key role in revealing the unethical behaviour of radio talkback hosts , which became known as the cash for comment affair and was the subject of an investigation by what was then the Australian Broadcasting Authority ( ABA ) .\nFormat .\nMedia Watch is a 15-minute program which identifies , investigates and examines instances of what the program determines to be failings in news coverage by Australian media outlets . The series features a single host speaking directly to camera , detailing a mix of amusing or embarrassing editing gaffes ( such as miscaptioned photographs or spelling errors ) as well as more serious criticism including media bias and breaches of journalistic ethics and standards . Over the years , the programs emphasis has shifted towards the latter .\nAlthough most episodes of Media Watch focus on any recent incidents of media misconduct , episodes sometimes focus on a single issue of particular importance ( for instance , news coverage of a recent election ) .\nPresenters .\nStuart Littlemore was the inaugural host of Media Watch and remains the longest-running host to date . Following his nine-year tenure , various other journalists have hosted the program . Paul Barry , who previously hosted the program in 2000 and for a brief period in 2010 , resumed hosting duties in 2013 .\n- Stuart Littlemore ( 1989–97 )\n- Richard Ackland ( 1998–99 )\n- David Marr ( 2002–04 )\n- Liz Jackson ( 2005 )\n- Monica Attard ( 2006–07 )\n- Jonathan Holmes ( 2008–13 )\n- Paul Barry ( 2000 , 2010 , 2013– )\nNotable pieces .\nCash for comment .\nIn 1999 , Media Watch revealed that influential talkback radio hosts Alan Jones and John Laws had been paid to provide favourable on-air comment about companies such as Qantas , Optus , Foxtel and Mirvac without disclosing these arrangements to listeners . It also persistently criticised the then Australian Broadcasting Authority ( superseded by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , or ACMA , in 2005 ) as impotent or unwilling to regulate broadcast media , and to properly scrutinise figures such as Jones and Laws . The revelations won Media Watch staffers Richard Ackland , Deborah Richards and Anne Connolly two Walkley Awards : the Gold Walkley , and the Walkley for TV Current Affairs Reporting ( Less Than 10 Minutes ) . In 2004 , Media Watch played a major part in forcing the resignation of ABA head David Flint after it was discovered that Flint had sent Jones admiring and effusive letters at a time when the ABA was investigating Jones concerning further cash for comment allegations . The reports won Media Watch another Walkley , TV Current Affairs Reporting ( Less Than 20 Minutes ) to staffers David Marr , Peter McEvoy and Sally Virgoe .\n60 Minutes 1995 massacre at Srebrenica story .\nIn 2002 , Channel Nine 60 Minutes reporter Richard Carleton sued Media Watch over allegations of plagiarism . The judge found that the allegations were untrue and declined to award any damages . The ABC World Today reported on 18 December 2002 : The veteran reporter was horrified to see Media Watch accuse him of plagiarising a BBC documentary on the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica for his Channel Nine program . But today a judge ruled that even though the program did defame Mr Richard Carleton and two colleagues , it was fair comment and no damages were awarded .\nThe Truth Behind Tuam .\nIn June 2014 , Media Watch examined false claims of a mass grave being discovered in County Galway , on the west coast of Ireland , found on the site of an old mother and baby home run by nuns in the town of Tuam . The story was repeated by global broadcasters including the ABC . In his editorial about the incident , Barry concluded , So why did the media fall for it ? .. . [ I ] t matched our prejudices . And it made such great headlines , it was really too good to check . And who cared if it suggested those nuns were mass murderers ?\nCancellation and return .\nMedia Watchs ability to generate controversy led to the temporary cancellation of the show . In 2000 , Barry was controversially sacked and , in 2001 , the program itself was axed by Jonathan Shier , the head of the ABC . However , in early 2002 , after Shier was himself sacked in similarly controversial circumstances , the show returned with David Marr as the new host . While Media Watch was off air , former host Stuart Littlemore presented a replacement program , Littlemore , that also examined issues about the media , running for 13 episodes between March and May 2001 .\nMedia Bites .\nStarting in 2017 in conjunction with Media Watchs return , a weekly online spin-off series , Media Bites , was created . A new episode is uploaded every Thursday to the programs website , social media outlets , iView and ABCs official YouTube channel , each episode running for about two minutes . Unlike the main show , Media Bites is more casual in presentation , and Barry sits in the production office ( not a studio ) talking to the camera in a position similar to many online vloggers . Barry is often in more casual clothing using the light source of the office instead of professional lighting .\nEach episode has the same format , two mini-stories and the weeks alternative fact . The mini-stories are in essence a shorter version of the main series in-depth format , introducing the story and explaining the problem . For example , a story where Womans Day ran an article about Paul Hogans ex-wife ( Noelene Hogan ) in which , using a photo of Noelene with her son , the article incorrectly portrays the son as her deceased partner Reg , stating the couple were a cute pair , only to be corrected by a tweet from a family member . The Alternative Fact of the Week points out an incorrect or baffling tidbit , often involving US President Donald Trump . Episodes conclude with a teaser for the following episode of the main show . The episodes contain the same sarcasm and quips from Barry as does the main show .\nEpisodes are edited in a similar fashion to the main show , with relevant corresponding images , text and effects relating to his narration . The stand-out difference in editing is that subtitles are permanently part of the video along the bottom of the screen , instead of being an optional closed caption .\nReception .\nThe shows presenters have taken some pride in the vehemence of the criticism it attracts ; at one point , the opening credits were made up of a montage of such criticisms , prominently featuring a description of original presenter Stuart Littlemore as a pompous git . In 2002 , the then-editor of The Daily Telegraph , Campbell Reid , sent host David Marr a dead fish ; a replica of it is now awarded as the Campbell Reid Perpetual Trophy for the Brazen Recycling of Other Peoples Work . Known as The Barra and bearing the motto Carpe Verbatim , it is awarded annually for bad journalism and particularly plagiarism ( a practice for which Reid was frequently criticised ) .\nMedia Watch scrutinises all media outlets , and has criticised its own network , the ABC . When Marr was host from 2002 to 2004 , the show often criticised Marrs employer John Fairfax Holdings .\nRobert Manne , writing in The Age in 2007 , commented that :\nMedia Watch was once , unashamedly , a program of the left.. . was sometimes unbalanced and unfair , usually intelligent and witty , always fearless and tough . No program more effectively tracked the steady drift of the political culture to the right . No program more effectively scrutinised the politics and practices of the contemporary commercial mainstream media—the rise of commentariat Islamophobia , the scandal of cash for comment . The fact that it was not impartial was the key to its unpopularity in certain quarters , but also to its importance and success .\nMedia analysis programs and segments on Sky News Australia also describe the program as having consistent left wing bias , but see this as a weakness and not a strength of the program . Following the 2019 federal election , Sky News Australia media analyst Chris Kenny wrote for The Australian that the programs reliance on Labor Party or trade union-aligned journalists to criticise News Limited , coupled with a failure to disclose those associations , undermines the credibility of host Barrys editorials against News Limited .\nThe Australian , which is regularly criticised by Media Watch , has been a long-term counter-critic of the show . In August 2007 it editorialised that Media Watch lacks journalistic integrity and conducts its affairs along the lines of an insiders club that pushes its ideological prejudice at taxpayers expense .\nIn June 2007 , an episode of Media Watch entitled Have Your Spray strongly criticised The Daily Telegraph , among others , for failing to censor racist comments on their website forums posted over an extended period , but then allowed strongly anti-Semitic comments to remain on its own web forum for a few minutes until removed . The ABC later launched an internal inquiry into Media Watch reliance on IslamicSydney , an Islamic website that peddle [ s ] anti-Semitic and jihadi messages , for this story .",

    "story": "Vilhelm Bjerknes\nVilhelm Friman Koren Bjerknes ( ; 14 March 1862 – 9 April 1951 ) was a Norwegian physicist and meteorologist who did much to found the modern practice of weather forecasting . He formulated the primitive equations that are still in use in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling , and he developed the so-called Bergen School of Meteorology , which was successful in advancing weather prediction and meteorology in the early 20th century .\nLife and career .\nBorn in Christiania ( later renamed Oslo ) , Bjerknes enjoyed an early exposure to fluid dynamics , as assistant to his father , Carl Anton Bjerknes , who had discovered by mathematical analysis the apparent actions at a distance between pulsating and oscillating bodies in a fluid , and their analogy with the electric and magnetic actions at a distance . Apparently no attempt had been made to demonstrate experimentally the theories arrived at by the older professor until Vilhelm Bjerknes , then about 17 or 18 years of age , turned his mathematical knowledge and mechanical abilities to the devising of a series of instruments by which all the well-known phenomena of electricity and magnetism were illustrated and reproduced by spheres and discs and membranes set into rhythmic vibration in a bath containing a viscous fluid such as syrup . These demonstrations formed the most important exhibit in the department of physics at the Exposition Internationale dÉlectricité held in Paris in 1881 , and aroused greatest interest in the scientific world .\nVilhelm Bjerknes became assistant to Heinrich Hertz in Bonn 1890–1891 and made substantial contributions to Hertz work on electromagnetic resonance . He succeeded in giving the explanation of the phenomenon called multiple resonance , discovered by Sarasin and De la Rive . Continuing his experiments at the University of Christiania ( 1891–1892 ) , he proved experimentally the influence which the conductivity and the magnetic properties of the metallic conductors exert upon the electric oscillations , and measured the depth to which the electric oscillations penetrate in metals of different conductivity and magnetic permeability ( the skin effect ) . Finally , in 1895 he furnished a complete theory of the phenomenon of electric resonance , involving a method of utilizing resonance experiments for the determination of the wavelengths , and especially of the damping ( the logarithmic decrement ) of the oscillations in the transmitter and the receiver of the electric oscillations . These methods contributed much to the development of wireless telegraphy . His papers on electric oscillations were published in Annalen der Physik ( 1891–1895 ) .\nIn 1895 , he became professor of applied mechanics and mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm where he had been lecturer since 1893 . There he elucidated the fundamental interaction between fluid dynamics and thermodynamics . His major contribution was the primitive equations which are used in climate models .\nIt was this work that inspired both V . Walfrid Ekman and Carl-Gustav Arvid Rossby to apply it to large-scale motions in the oceans and atmosphere and to make modern weather forecasting feasible . Bjerknes himself had foreseen the possible applications as early as 1904 . This attack upon the meteorological problems from a hydrodynamical point of view was after 1906 supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington , D.C. , of which he became a research associate . Two introductory volumes , Statics and Kinematics , of a greater work , Dynamic Meteorology and Hydrography , were published in 1913 under the auspices of the Institution .\nIn his 1906 work Fields of force , Bjerknes was the first to describe and mathematically derive translational forces on bubbles in an acoustic field , now known as Bjerknes forces .\nIn his Vorlesungen über Hydrodynamische Fernkräfte nach C . A . Bjerknes Theorie ( 1900–1902 ) he gave the first complete mathematical and experimental exposition of the discoveries of his father , whose age and excessive self-criticism had prevented him from finishing his work himself . In a later book , Die Kraftfelder ( 1909 ) , he stated the same theory in a very much generalized form according to methods of his own .\nIn 1907 , Bjerknes returned to the Royal Frederick University in Oslo before becoming professor of geophysics at the University of Leipzig in 1912 . In 1916 , he started the publication Synoptische Darstellung atmosphärischer Zustände über Europa . In 1917 , he founded the Geophysical Institute , University of Bergen where he wrote his book On the Dynamics of the Circular Vortex with Applications to the Atmosphere and to Atmospheric Vortex and Wave Motion ( 1921 ) , and laid the foundation for the Bergen School of Meteorology , which was not a literal school but a school of thought on how the practice of weather forecasting and meteorology should be undertaken . He was the originator of an improved and more scientific weather service , afterwards controlled by his son and collaborator , the meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes ( 1897–1975 ) .\nFrom 1926 to his retirement in 1932 he held a position at the University of Oslo . He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1905 and of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1936 and a Fellow of the Royal Society . He was awarded the 1932 Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society .\nHe died of heart problems in Oslo . In 1893 Bjerknes had married Honoria Bonnevie , who in earlier years assisted him much in his scientific work . Their son Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes also became a meteorologist .\nThe craters Bjerknes on the Moon and Bjerknes on Mars are named in his honor .\nFurther reading .\n- M.R .

    "story": "Norisbank\nThe Norisbank GmbH is a German bank with headquarters in Bonn . Since 2 November 2006 , it has been a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank and since 27 July 2012 purely a direct bank .\nHistory .\nThe roots of Norisbank date back to the year 1954 . Starting that year , the mail-order company Quelle offered to finance its products via the Noris purchase aid .\nOn 4 June 1965 , the Noris Kreditbank GmbH was founded in Nuremberg . The business objective was to expand the financing of the entire supply of Quelle and its subsidiaries in the mail order and in the stationary sector . In the year 1969 the Noris purchase aid changed its name to Noris Bank GmbH . The name change was accompanied by an expansion of the product range to include banking services such as checking and savings accounts .\nIn 1984 , the Norisbank GmbH merged with the Hamburg Verbraucherbank GmbH . The reason for the takeover of the previously independent Verbraucherbank GmbH was the acquisition of the first German customer self-service system . The Verbraucherbank had introduced the customer self-service in 1975 as the first financial institution in Germany , 1977 one of the first ATMs worldwide followed as well as the first online banking offer in Germany in 1980 . The Noris Verbraucherbank GmbH was part of the Quelle Group until the end of 1997 and was sold to Bayerische Vereinsbank on 19 June 1997 . It merged the Noris Verbraucherbank GmbH with the Franken WKV Bank GmbH ( founded in 1950 ) .\nIn January 1999 , the Hypo Service Bank ( HSB ) , founded in 1991 , was integrated into Norisbank AG . In 2000 , Norisbank AG was the first bank on the Internet to offer loans with an online instant pledge .\nAfter uncertainties in 2002 , when the HypoVereinsbank was considering integrating the Norisbank into its own branch network , it was decided in December 2002 to sell the Norisbank . On 1 October 2003 , DZ Bank became the new owner of Norisbank AG for a purchase price of EUR 180 million .\nOn August 3 , 2006 , the DZ Bank sold the 98 branches and the brand name Norisbank for 420 million Euros to the Deutsche Bank , which also took over the customer base . The Norisbank AG based in Nuremberg then renamed to Teambank AG Nuremberg , while the sold branches were continued by the newly founded Norisbank GmbH based in Frankfurt am Main .\nCorporate Development .\nIn July 2005 , the Norisbank AG entered a new business field : the sale of its consumer credit easy credit , which was completely detached from other banking services , via installment credit stores in city centers , shopping malls and arterial roads in the city . Over the years , this market strategy has attracted 500,000 new customers . However , not all credit customers could be won as regular customers . In August 2006 , the bank had around 650,000 customers .\nIn the course of the sale to the Deutsche Bank some services were limited : Thus , the number of self-service terminals in the branches was reduced , there were no online foreign transfers possible and the cash counter no longer accepted coins . On January 1 , 2008 , the classic counter traffic was completely ended . Since then , the branches have only been advisory offices with self-service zones .\nBy the sale of Norisbank to the Deutsche Bank Group the Norisbank resigned from the ATM network CashPool on October 31 , 2006 and returned to the Cash Group . Because of its former affiliation with Hypovereinsbank , the Norisbank was already a member of the Cash Group until 2003 .\nThe new business model saw itself as a direct bank with branches . In the 90 branches , customers were able to receive advice on issues such as investments and pension plans . Despite the advice in the branch , branch customers received the same conditions as through direct sales .\nOn 1 October 2008 , the headquarter was moved to Berlin . As part of the restructuring , all branches were closed on 27 July 2012 and the Norisbank converted into a direct bank . Since then , banking transactions have been conducted by customers primarily via the Internet , via telephone banking and via the self-service terminals in Deutsche Banks branches . The 400 former branch employees were transferred without notice to Postbank , also a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank . Today , the Norisbank employs around fifty people ( mainly in management ) , and a large part of its banking services are provided by other employees within the Deutsche Bank Group . Since December 2014 , Bonn is the seat of the Norisbank .\nExternal links .\n- Official Website",

    "story": "Kezia Dugdale\nKezia Alexandra Ross Dugdale ( born 28 August 1981 ) is a Scottish politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2015 to 2017 . A former member of the Scottish Labour Party and Co-operative Party , she was a Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) for the Lothian region from 2011 to 2019 .\nBorn in Aberdeen and raised in Dundee , Dugdale studied Law at the University of Aberdeen and Policy Studies at the University of Edinburgh , where she was a campaigns and welfare adviser . After leaving university , she worked as an election agent , political researcher and parliamentary officer . She was elected at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election on the Lothian regional list and became Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2014 .\nDugdale was elected Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in the 2015 Scottish Labour leadership election . She led the party into the 2016 Scottish Parliament election ; where it finished third behind the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) and Scottish Conservatives and Dugdale failed to be elected to the Edinburgh Eastern constituency , once again being elected on the Lothian regional list . During the 2017 general election , the party held their previously sole seat and gained a further six seats from the SNP . She resigned as leader in August 2017 to pass on the baton to a successor who would lead the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election .\nAfter leaving frontbench politics , Dugdale worked as a columnist and appeared as a contestant on the seventeenth series of ITV reality show Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here ! in November 2017 . She later resigned her seat and Scottish Labour membership in July 2019 and accepted the role of director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service at the University of Glasgow .\nEarly life and education .\nDugdale was born in Aberdeen on 28 August 1981 . She attended secondary school at Harris Academy in Dundee , where she was Head Girl . She studied Law at the University of Aberdeen from 1999 until 2003 , and completed a Masters Degree in Policy Studies from 2004 until 2006 at the University of Edinburgh . Whilst attending university , she worked as Campaigns and Welfare Adviser for Edinburgh University Students Association and as Public Affairs Officer at the National Union of Students Scotland .\nEarly political career .\nDugdale sat on Scottish Labours Policy Forum from 2006 until 2008 , as well as serving as an election agent to both Sarah Boyack MSP and Sheila Gilmore MP . She had also volunteered as a researcher in the parliamentary office of Pauline McNeill MSP . She worked from 2007 to 2011 for the Labour Lothian regional MSP George Foulkes , by then also a Labour life peer , as his parliamentary office manager and political adviser .\nIn the 2011 Scottish Parliament election , Dugdale was elected to the Scottish Parliament as Scottish Labours second candidate on their list for the Lothian region . She served as a Scottish Labour and Co-operative Party member and sat on the Local Government and Regeneration and Subordinate Legislation Committees . Dugdale was appointed as Scottish Labours Spokesperson for Education and Lifelong Learning on 29 June 2013 .\nDugdale won the 2014 Scottish Labour deputy leadership election , succeeding Anas Sarwar , and defeating Katy Clark . As Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy did not have a seat in the Scottish Parliament , she stood in for him at First Ministers Questions . On 13 June 2015 , she resigned from the deputy leadership in order to contest the 2015 Scottish Labour leadership election . She was succeeded by Alex Rowley after the leadership election .\nLeader of the Scottish Labour Party .\nDuring the 2015 leadership election campaign , Dugdale said she would want to end the charitable status of private schools in Scotland which gives them tax breaks , a policy in her opinion unfair to state schools . In a July 2015 televised leadership debate , she said it was wrong the vast majority of the 232 Labour MPs abstained on the Conservative governments Welfare Reform and Work Bill in a second reading vote in the House of Commons . Following the resignation of Lord John Sewel on 28 July 2015 , she said the House of Lords should no longer be an unelected chamber and should be moved to Glasgow . She won the leadership on 15 August , defeating Ken Macintosh .\nDuring an August 2015 interview with The Guardian , Dugdale refused to publicly say who out of the four candidates in the UK Labour Party leadership election she supported , but did express serious doubts as to whether Jeremy Corbyn could ever become Prime Minister . After Corbyn had been elected as Leader of the Labour Party on 13 September , she revealed for the first time , on BBC Question Time on 30 October , she had voted for Yvette Cooper .\nDugdale led Scottish Labour into the 2016 Scottish Parliament election . Dugdale wanted to re-affirm Scottish Labours core beliefs and convey to the electorate what the party stood for . She focused her campaign on a proposal to increase income tax to tackle underfunding of services by the Scottish National Party government , particularly in education . Meanwhile , the Scottish Conservatives ambitions were to oppose Scottish independence and push Ruth Davidson as an effective leader opposed to the SNPs governmental agenda . The results put Scottish Labour behind both the SNP and Scottish Conservatives , with the party falling into third place from second . The party made a net loss of 12 constituency seats , gaining only one and holding another two , but retained 21 of its 22 regional seats which assign additional members to address imbalance in constituency results . Dugdale was once again returned as an additional member for the Lothian region , having failed to win the Edinburgh Eastern constituency from the SNP by 5,087 votes .\nOn 29 June 2016 , Dugdale called for Jeremy Corbyn to resign from his position as Leader of the Labour Party , after 174-to-40 Labour MPs voted no-confidence in his leadership . She said when 80% of his own MPs no longer supported him , Corbyn could not properly function as Labour leader or Leader of the Opposition in parliament , nor could he form a potential alternative government . On 22 August , she declared her support for Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election but also said her position would remain tenable were Corbyn to win re-election . After Corbyn won the leadership election , she first said that this made the Labour Party unelectable , then stated the opposite .\nDugdale was Leader of the Scottish Labour Party during the 2017 general election . In the previous general election in 2015 , the party lost 40 of its 41 seats in what was a landslide victory for the SNP , who won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland . Nicola Sturgeon based the 2017 SNP campaign on a promise to seek a second Scottish independence referendum with the aim of keeping an independent Scotland inside the European Union , a referendum Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Conservatives were opposed to . Dugdale again campaigned on what she saw as the need for an income tax increase to tackle education underfunding by the SNP . The results gave Scottish Labour seven seats . In their previously sole seat Edinburgh South , Ian Murray was returned with a super-majority of over 15,000 , and the party gained a further six seats from the SNP . However , the party came in third place behind the SNP with 35 seats and Scottish Conservatives with 13 .\nOn 29 August 2017 , Dugdale resigned as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect , commenting that it was time to pass on the baton to someone else . She opined that her successor needed the space and time to prepare for the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021 .\nLater career .\nIn November 2017 , ITV announced that Dugdale would appear as a contestant on its reality television series , Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here ! It was subsequently reported that she faced disciplinary action from the Labour Party because she did not notify party managers she would be out of the country on non-work related business while the Scottish Parliament was in session . On 21 November , the party said that she would not be suspended .\nDugdale made her first appearance on Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here ! on 22 November . She became the second person to be eliminated from the show . Speaking about the experience afterwards , she said that she knew her appearance on the programme would be a political gamble , but that she wanted to take on the myth that every politician [ is ] old , white , male , pale and stale and would return home with my head held high . She expressed regrets of the effect of her appearances on the show during the first weeks of the new Labour leadership in Scotland , and received a written warning for agreeing to take part without approval from the Scottish Labour parliamentary group . She promised to donate her MSP’s salary for her absence , and part of her show fees , to charity .\nIn 2018 , Stuart Campbell , a blogger running the pro-independence Wings Over Scotland website , started defamation proceedings against Dugdale about comments she made as a columnist for the Daily Record about his Twitter activity , a case he lost . The judgement said Dugdale was incorrect to imply Campbell had been homophobic but her article was protected under the principle of fair comment .\nOn 29 April 2019 , Dugdale announced she would be resigning as an MSP before the summer recess of the Scottish Parliament in order to take up the role of director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service at the University of Glasgow . On 15 July 2019 , Dugdale resigned as a Member of the Scottish Parliament . The following day it was announced she would be succeeded by former transport minister Sarah Boyack , who had been a candidate on the Lothian regional list in 2016 . On 10 October 2019 , it was revealed she had also resigned from Scottish Labour in the July , following disagreement with the party over Brexit .\nPersonal life .\nIn a 2016 interview with Mary Riddell for the Fabian Review , Dugdale said she was in a relationship with a woman but was disinclined to provide details of her private life . She first appeared in public with her partner Louise Riddell when they voted together in Edinburgh in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election . In February 2017 , Dugdale revealed the couple had separated shortly after the New Year and following nine years together . In July 2017 , it was reported Dugdale was in a relationship with Mid Fife and Glenrothes MSP Jenny Gilruth , a member of the SNP , and the two had started dating around four months earlier . In September 2017 , she was named Politician of the Year at the Icon Awards , an awards ceremony celebrating Scotlands LGBT community .\nDugdales father Jeff Dugdale is a retired teacher living in Elgin , Moray and is a campaigner for the Scottish independence movement . Her relationship with her father has been left sad and sore by his public criticisms toward her over Twitter and his support for Stuart Campbell in the defamation case against her .\nDugdale says her interests include the theatre , Scottish crime novels , and the city of Edinburgh . She supports Hibernian F.C. , living close to their ground at Easter Road . She has lived in the Lochend , and Meadowbank , area since 2006 . She is a member of Unite the Union and the Community trade union . From 2014 until 2018 , she had a weekly column in the Daily Record . She has also written for LabourList and Progress .",

    "story": "Nathan Ellington\nNathan Levi Fontaine Ellington ( born 2 July 1981 ) is a retired English footballer who played as a striker .\nEllington started his playing career with non-League side Tooting & Mitcham United . Having played once for the club , he switched to Walton & Hersham in 1997 , and remained there for two years , before signing for Bristol Rovers in February 1999 . He played for Bristol Rovers in 116 league games , before switching to Wigan Athletic in March 2002 . He made 134 league appearances for Wigan before joining Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in 2005 . Although he made 68 league appearances for the club , he struggled to settle in the area , and moved to Watford in 2007 . During his time at Watford , he spent three loan spells away from the club ; at Derby County during the 2008–2009 season , Skoda Xanthi in 2010 , and Preston North End in 2011 . Having made 55 league appearances for Watford , he switched to Ipswich Town in June 2011 , but once again struggled to break into the first team , and spent the start of the 2012–13 season on loan to Scunthorpe United . Having cancelled his Ipswich contract by mutual consent , he joined Crewe Alexandra in March 2013 , and made eight league appearances . He was released in July 2013 after his contract expired . He signed for Southport in October 2013 , but was released two months later . In November 2017 he signed for Cheshire Football League side Egerton , and in July 2018 was appointed assistant manager .\nPlaying career .\nNon-league and Bristol Rovers .\nBorn in Bradford , West Yorkshire , Ellington began his career with non-League Tooting & Mitcham United , making one first team appearance at 16 years of age . He played regularly for the youth team there , but was frustrated by a lack of first team chances , so he moved to Walton & Hersham , before moving to Bristol Rovers in February 1999 for £150,000 . He made his professional debut on 23 February 1999 , coming on as a second-half substitute for Jamie Cureton in a 1–0 home defeat to Gillingham . He came off the bench to score his first goal on 6 March 1999 , helping his team to a 2–0 win over York City . He found a growing reputation with the side , and his highest point for Rovers was scoring a hat-trick in a 3–1 win against Premier League side Derby County in the FA Cup , on 6 January 2002 . This was the first time a team from the Third Division had beaten a Premier League team in the FA Cup . It was also the second of three hat-tricks scored by Ellington for Rovers , with all three coming within the space of a month . He was named in the PFA Division Three team of the year for 2001–02 .\nWigan Athletic .\nOn 28 March 2002—transfer deadline day—Ellington signed for Paul Jewells Wigan Athletic for a then club record fee of £1.2 million . He made an instant impact , scoring on his debut in a 2–1 win at Chesterfield on 6 April 2002 . He also scored on his home debut a week later as Wigan beat Northampton Town 3–0 . His only hat-trick for Wigan came against West Bromwich Albion in a 3–1 League Cup victory on 2 October 2002 , his second career hat-trick against Premiership opposition . He notably scored the last ever goal in Wimbledon F.C.s final game at Selhurst Park before their rebranding and relocation to Milton Keynes , during Wigans 2–4 victory in September 2003 . He was named Division One player of the month for February 2004 . Ellington was a major factor in the clubs promotion to the Premiership in the 2004–05 season , the first time they had reached the top flight in their history . He was the leading scorer in the Football League Championship and formed a formidable partnership with Jason Roberts , with whom he had previously played at Bristol Rovers . Both players were named in the PFA Championship team of the season . Ellington became one of the more desirable properties in English football , and joined West Bromwich Albion on 16 August 2005 for £3,000,001 . With the player unable to agree a new contract with Wigan , Albion used a clause in his existing contract that allowed him to leave for any fee over £3 million .\nWest Bromwich Albion .\nEllington made his West Brom ( and Premier League ) debut in a 4–0 away defeat at Chelsea on 24 August 2005 , replacing Jonathan Greening in the second half . He scored twice in a 4–1 League Cup win against Bradford City on 20 September 2005 , his first goals for the club . He generally struggled in his first ever season in the Premier League , as his season was damaged by a series of niggling injuries and a shoulder problem , but he still managed to score eight goals . Ellingtons first Premiership goals came in the 4–0 win against Everton ; he scored a goal in either half by a penalty and a long range shot . He became quite unpopular with the West Brom fans towards the end of the same season because of his complaint of a bruised toe , and his refusal to have painkilling injections to help him through such a minor complaint . He almost redeemed himself near the end of the season though , when he scored for Albion in the 1–1 draw with Birmingham and almost went on to score the winner as a substitute , hitting the woodwork . In June 2006 , West Bromwich Albion rejected an undisclosed offer for Ellington from his former club Wigan Athletic , insisting that the player was not for sale .\nAfter failing to settle in the area , Ellington submitted a transfer request in the 2007 January transfer window , which was reluctantly accepted by West Bromwich Albion . However , Albion chairman Jeremy Peace qualified this by stating that ...no-one will leave unless it suits us . Ellington was also still seen as an important part of the squad by manager Tony Mowbray . Wigan Athletic again expressed an interest in re-signing the player , but failed to meet Albions valuation . Ellington therefore remained at the Midlands club , returning to the first team at the start of February after a month out due to a stress-related illness . Ellington won West Broms official goal of the season competition for 2006–07 , for his dipping , swerving half volley against Cardiff City , scored in a 1–0 win on 20 February 2007 . One week after that goal , he received the first red card of his career , for a dangerous tackle on Middlesbroughs Stuart Parnaby . Albion subsequently lost the 5th round FA Cup replay on penalties . Ellington featured regularly towards the end of the season , helping Albion reach the play-offs , but in the play-off games he was used only as a substitute . Albion lost 1–0 to Derby County in the final at Wembley .\nEllingtons only goal for Albion in 2007–08 came in a 2–0 win away at Peterborough United in the League Cup on 28 August 2007 . It proved to be his last game for the club , as he signed for Watford the following day . In all he scored 20 goals in 81 appearances for West Bromwich Albion .\nWatford .\nOn 29 August 2007 , Ellington joined Watford on a four-year deal . Watford paid a then club record £3.25 million for the striker , a fee that could rise to £4.25 million depending on appearances . He made his Watford debut three days later , coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 win over Ipswich Town , hitting the post a few minutes after entering the field . Ellington initially found it difficult to command a place in the Watford starting line-up due to the excellent form of Darius Henderson and Marlon King , and his first goal for Watford did not come until he scored in a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic on 19 January 2008 , and went on to score a further 2 goals in 3 games , but then did not score again until 5 April against Coventry , his last of the season . Ellington made 34 league appearances , 18 of them starts , scoring 4 goals .\nOn 21 December 2009 , Ellington signed for Greek side Xanthi FC on loan for the rest of the year . Having played in Greece for the whole of 2010 , he returned to Watford in January 2011 , but is unlikely to feature in their games .\nHe trained with Preston North End in January 2011 , scoring two goals in a reserve team fixture on 11 January 2011 . He signed for Preston on 13 January 2011 on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season . He will then be out of contract .\nDerby County ( loan ) .\nDerby County signed Ellington on 30 May 2008 on a season-long loan , with a view to him joining the Rams permanently on a free transfer at the end of the season , in a move that re-united the player with manager Paul Jewell . Ellington had a successful pre-season with the Rams , scoring three times in seven matches . He made his debut for the club against Doncaster Rovers on 9 August 2008 and scored his first three goals for the club with a hat-trick against Lincoln City in the Football League Cup on 12 August . He scored his first league goal for the club on 4 October , an eighty-fifth-minute winner in the 2–1 victory away to Norwich City . He scored twice in a week in November - the second in a 4–1 victory at Brighton and Hove Albion on 4 November and the second in a 2–1 win at home to Leeds United on 11 November .\nEllington scored a penalty in the ninety-third minute against Stoke City in the quarter-finals of the League Cup on 2 December , which sent Derby into the semi-finals for the first time in 40 years . His final goals in a Derby shirt came against Charlton Athletic on 15 December , scoring a brace to level the game at 2–2 . Ellington made only 5 more appearances before the end of the season , just 2 of them coming under new Derby manager Nigel Clough and both of them substitute appearances . Ellington finished joint top-scorer in the 2008–09 League Cup , with 6 goals , but after scoring just 3 league goals in 27 games , Clough decided not to take up the option of signing Ellington , preferring Rob Hulse , Chris Porter and Luke Varney in attack . Ellington subsequently returned to Watford .\nPreston North End .\nEllington signed for Preston North End on 13 January 2011 on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season . He made his debut as a substitute in the 1–1 draw with Leicester City . He scored his first goal in the last minute of the game against Coventry City . His second goal was against Sheffield United when Iain Hume put him through on goal .\nIpswich Town .\nEllington signed a two-year contract for Ipswich Town on a free transfer on 21 June 2011 , linking up with manager Paul Jewell for the third time . On 31 January 2013 , Ipswich announced they had parted ways with Ellington by mutual consent .\nCrewe Alexandra .\nOn 8 March 2013 , Ellington signed for Crewe Alexandra until the end of the 2012-13 season after a one-month trial . He left the club in July 2013 after the expiry of his contract .\nSouthport .\nOn 17 October 2013 , Ellington signed on non-contract terms for Conference Premier side Southport . However , after a change in management he was released by the club in December in order to make further additions to their squad .\nFree agent .\nOn 18 February 2014 , Ellington joined Indonesian club Persija Jakarta on trial but decided to leave once he saw the setup and facilities .\nPersonal life .\nIn 2005 , Ellington married a Bosnian woman , Alma from Tuzla , and after doing research , he converted to Islam and became a Muslim before they married .\nIn 2011 , he set up the Association of Muslim Footballers , whose purpose is to provide a network for Muslim players and families , highlighting the positive Muslim role models within the professional game and working to improve relationships between players of other beliefs . In relation to how Ramadan affected his football , Ellington has stated When Im playing an away match , I wont fast , but Ill make up for the missed day afterwards . For training , theres not a problem either , as you can get your hydration and nutrients with the suhoor ( the early pre-dawn breakfast ) which then helps . The only difference is afterwards when the rest of the players go off [ to eat ] and you have to hang on for a while longer , until the iftar meal at sunset .\nIn the past few years he has visited his wifes country of origin and since then Ellington has expressed interest in playing for the Bosnian national team . He is nicknamed The Duke after legendary jazz musician Duke Ellington . Ellington is from a sporting family ; his cousin Lee Ellington is also a footballer .\nCareer statistics .\nStats accurate as of 08:20 , 29 August 2013 ( UTC ) .\nHonours .\nWigan Athletic\n- Football League Second Division : 2002–03\n- Football League Championship runner-up : 2004–05\nIndividual\n- PFA Team of the Year : 2001–02 Third Division , 2004–05 Championship\n- Football League Cup top goalscorer : 2002–03 , 2008–09\n- Football League Championship Golden Boot : 2004–05\n- Nominated for the Best at Sport award at the British Muslim Awards : 2014\nExternal links .\n- Nathan Ellington profile at watfordfc.co.uk",

He served as the CEO for seven years , until he was ousted by the board in 2007 .\nTechnology ( 2009–present ) .\nEpik .\nMonster founded Epik , a domain registrar and web hosting company , in 2009 in Sammamish , Washington . he continues to serve as the CEO of the company .\nMonster has been an outspoken defender of Epiks choice to host far-right , neo-Nazi , and other extremist content that other web hosts have refused , saying that the company is committed to protecting lawful free speech . He learned about Gab , a far-right social network , in 2018 when the company received media attention after it was discovered that the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting had used the service to post extremist content . After it was dropped by its registrar , GoDaddy , he met with Gab CEO Andrew Torba and agreed to register the website . The BBC reported Monster as saying that Gabs founder Andrew Torba was doing something that looks useful , and that Gabs removal from the internet was digital censorship . He subsequently became an active user and defender of the network . He has received media attention for publicly defending violent neo-Nazi Gab users , maligning people who criticize the site and call for stricter moderation , and making unevidenced claims that racist users are fake accounts created to hurt the sites reputation .\nMonster also previously defended the idea of hosting 8chan , a far-right imageboard known for its hateful content , connections to multiple mass shootings , and hosting of child pornography . Epik briefly hosted 8chan after Cloudflare terminated services for the site , after the perpetrator of the 2019 El Paso shooting allegedly used it to post his justification for the shooting . The following day Epik was banned from their primary hardware provider Voxility because of their services to 8chan , taking 8chan , The Daily Stormer , and other Epik customers offline . Monster wrote the day after the ban from Voxility that he had changed his decision to provide services to the imageboard site , although Ars Technica noted in August 2019 that the company had only stopped providing 8chan with content hosting services , and had taken on providing the sites DNS services .\nThe Daily Telegraph described Monster in 2021 as a key figure in the far-rights battle to stay online . Michael Edison Hayden , a researcher with the Southerhn Poverty Law Center , has said that many harmful websites would not be on the internet if it were not for Epik , and that No one is saying that Rob Monster himself is going out there and making terroristic threats , but if he doesnt want to be associated with this brand , he can certainly step up and say , absolutely , I dont want anything to do with this material . But hes not doing that . Monster himself has joked that he is the Lex Luthor of the Internet .\nOther companies .\nIn 2015 , Monster became the interim CEO for DigitalTown , a company that provides community-building platforms . He resigned from this position in 2018 in what was described as a planned departure to allow him to focus on Epik .\nMonster founded Toki , a company which provides servers to be distributed in Africa and Asia . Built on inexpensive Raspberry Pi hardware , they run a proprietary version on the Linux operating system . The servers are powered either by a wired electrical connection or battery power ; they connect to the Internet , but if no connection is available , they allow users to access preloaded digital content including educational resources , books , maps , and religious content . The servers use technology that Toki says could filter content to avoid some sources of information , or bypass local censorship rules . They also run a search engine which they say is censorship-resistant .\nIn 2019 , Monster founded the company eRise , which will distribute the devices created by Toki . The servers are still in development , but the company plans to begin distributing them in 2022 or 2023 .\nJoan Donovan , the director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at the Shorenstein Center on Media , Politics and Public Policy , has compared the goals of Toki and eRise to the controversial Internet.org project : Weve seen a similar tactic by Facebook , to provide digital access points that can also serve the purpose of delivering favorable content and ensuring that these groups become dependent on your benevolence.. . It becomes that much harder later on to change the power dynamics when the ideology is in the infrastructure . Mark Harris writing for TechCrunch observed that , The Toki devices selectivity , if practical , could raise its own content and censorship concerns ; for example , if eRise allowed extreme content similar to that seen on Epiks clients like Gab and Parler , or ignored scientific advice on COVID-19 or other health issues .\nPolitics .\nMonsters political beliefs were described by HuffPost in 2018 as at times.. . almost indistinguishable from those of the neo-Nazis hes defended on Gab . The Daily Telegraph said in 2021 that his comments veer between free speech protectionism and implying support for the type of content his clients carry . Monster describes his own views as Christian libertarianism . Monster has said he is not a free speech absolutist , pointing to his and Epiks decisions to deny services to 8chan as an example of his unwillingness to service companies that cross a bright line , in this case the possibility of violent radicalization on the platform . Bobby Allyn wrote for NPR in February 2021 : Yet his self-professed boundaries become squishy upon examination , giving an example where Monster demurred on questions about Epiks choice to platform Gab , where white supremacist founder of The Daily Stormer Andrew Anglin has 17,000 followers . William Turton and Joshua Brustein wrote in Bloomberg Businessweek in April 2021 that Monster had been radicalized during the Trump years , subjecting his staff to florid conspiracy theories in staff meetings and spending more and more of his energy on politically charged work at Epik .\nIn December 2018 , Monster shared on Gab a video created by Canadian white nationalist Faith Goldy , in which she described migrants as bringing rape epidemics , sharia law , and the spectacle of terror . In January 2019 , Monster appeared as a guest on The Peoples Square , a podcast hosted by pseudonymous white nationalist Eric Striker . The SPLC criticized him for appearing on the show and for comments he made about white supremacist and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke , including Hes actually a pretty clever guy , hes articulate . He knows history . And I dont know the body of his work , but have a feeling that many people grew up with this mindset that you shouldnt listen to anything David Duke says . Monster later told the SPLC in an interview that he did not know who Striker was when he agreed to speak with him , and that he disagrees with Dukes racist worldview but respects his intelligence . In an interview with NPR in February 2021 , Monster suggested that leaders in the white supremacist movement are shock jocks and should not be taken seriously . David Kaye , law professor at the University of California , Irvine and an expert in online speech , said of Monsters comment : He can say theyre just shock jocks , but what we actually see is real world harm coming from the platforms . So how much is somebody who is allowing that content to be hosted operating in real good faith ?\nMonster has been accused of antisemitism because of some of his writings on Gab , where he has said Are there a lot of Jewish people who are in a position of power or influence and favor other Jewish people , Ashkenazi , or otherwise ? Sure . Do I think God is impressed by that ? No , I do not.. . God will deal with them and in His time and His way regardless of hoaxes and conspiracies along the way . He has replied to a user who referred to him using the antisemitic slur rat kike to say he was not a kike nor governed by one . :- ) , and reassured a person who expressed disapproval that two members of Epiks board were Jewish that having a Jewish person on Epiks board may be somewhat helping with keeping certain forces at bay . As of 2020 , both Jewish board members had resigned from Epik over ideological differences . Monster has also suggested that the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting was a false flag attack . In a comment on an Epik blog post explaining why the registrar accepted Gabs business , he wrote I have many Jewish friends , and have been called Mensch many times .\nMonster has promoted several other conspiracy theories , including that the 2018 death of an American missionary who had traveled to North Sentinel Island was a psyop intended to discourage Christians from doing missionary work .\nMonster was widely condemned in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings for uploading video of the shootings to Twitter and Gab . He posted on Gab that he had uploaded the file to the InterPlanetary File System ( IPFS ) , and wrote that Epik was working on a tool to make it simpler for people to create IPFS files , describing IPFS as crazy clever technology that makes files effectively uncensorable . He also shared the link to the video on Twitter after Twitter announced it would be removing any video of the incident . His tweet was removed by Twitter after several hours . A former Epik staff member alleged that Monster had begun a company staff meeting by asking employees to watch the video of the shootings , saying that it would prove to them that the attack had been faked .",

    "story": "Alfred Drury\nEdward Alfred Briscoe Drury ( 11 November 1856 – 24 December 1944 ) was an English architectural sculptor and artist active in the New Sculpture movement . During a long career Drury created a great number of decorative figures such as busts and statuettes plus larger monuments , war memorials , statues of royalty and architectural pieces . During the opening years of the 20th-century he was among the foremost architectural sculptors active in Britain and in that period created the series of works in central London for which he is perhaps now best known . These include the figures on the Old War Office building in Whitehall , elements of the facade of the Victoria and Albert Museum and four of the colossal statues on Vauxhall Bridge .\nBiography .\nEducation and training .\nDrury was born in Islington , London but raised in Oxford , where his father was a pub landlord . Drury studied at the Oxford School of Art and then at the National Art Training School in South Kensington , where his teachers included Jules Dalou and , later , Édouard Lantéri . Drury won gold medals in National Art Competitions in 1879 , 1880 and 1881 before moving to Paris where he worked as an assistant to Dalou until 1885 . When he returned to London he worked as an assistant to the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm and began establishing himself as an independent artist . In 1885 Drury showed his first work at the Royal Academy , a terracotta copy of a sculpture by Dilou , The Triumph of Silenus . While his early exhibition pieces , such as 1886s The First Lesson , clearly showed the impact of his time in France , Drury soon became associated with the British New Sculpture movement . Both Circe , from 1895 , and Griselda of 1896 were typical of the allegorical female figures from mythology and literature that were key subjects of the movement and both sculptures were reproduced in several different sizes in both bronze and marble by Drury in subsequent years .\nEarly commissions .\nAlongside work on his exhibition pieces , Drury also began undertaking architectural commissions . In 1897 , for example , he created a set of terracotta spandrels , representing Art and Design , for a coach builders premises , now demolished , at Hammersmith in London and is thought to have completed other projects outside of London at this time for which records have been lost . He is known to have completed the two low-relief bronze plaques , featuring the head of a river god and female figures , installed to mark the opening of the Blackwall Tunnel in 1897 . He collaborated with the architect Inigo Thomas on a decorative scheme for the gardens at Barrow Court near Bristol . Tasked with providing sculptures for twelve pillars along a boundary wall , Drury carved a sequence of female heads from a baby to that of an old women to represent the months of the year from January to December . Drurys original life-size bronze version of Circe was purchased for a park in Leeds and is now in Leeds City Museum . This led to him receiving several commissions in that city , including for the eight lamp standards representing Morning and Evening positioned in Leeds City Square . Drury was awarded a gold medal at the 1900 Paris International Exhibition for a version of Circe and for a bust of a child , The Age of Innocence . In 1905 Drury exhibited a new cast of the Evening head titled Spirit of the Night and in 1911 carved a marble version of the statue .\nThe architect John Belcher hired Drury , and others , to create the external decoration for Electra House at Moorgate in central London in 1902 , and he also employed him , the following year , to sculpt external features for the nearby offices of the Royal London Friendly Society in Finsbury Square . For the latter scheme Drury carved several female faces and half-figures including a large keystone figure above the main entrance , consisting of the head of a woman wearing a bronze helmet and framed by oak and ivy branches . The model for this composition was shown at the Royal Academy in 1904 and was widely praised .\nMajor works .\nBy 1904 Drury had become established as one of the foremost architectural sculptors active in Britain at the time and this led to the series of commissions for which he is perhaps best known , for the War Office in Whitehall , for the facade of the Victoria and Albert Museum and for Vauxhall Bridge .\nFor the Old War Office Building on Horse Guards Avenue and Whitehall , Drury created four groups of two seated , twice life-size , female figures in Portland stone during 1904 and 1905 . The pairs were The Sorrow of Peace opposite The Winged Messinger of Peace , the Horrors of War against the Dignity of War , Truth and Justice plus Victory and Fame . The artistic choices Drury made with the pairings and the amount of detail he incorporated into the carvings drew much attention in the newspaper coverage of the new building . For example , the War pairing contrasted a figure of Minerva holding a sword and shield with a more fearful figure holding a skull while some of the figures had gilded bronze attachments such as Victory who holds a small gilded statuette and Truth who has a gilded mirror . Although the works were 70 feet above street level it was reported that crowds of sightseers gathered to view them .\nIn late 1904 the London County Council commissioned Drury and F . W . Pomeroy to each create four colossal bronze figures for niches on the piers supporting the new Vauxhall Bridge . For the eastern , downstream , side of the bridge Drury created four female figures representing the Fine Arts , holding a statuette and palette , Science holding a globe , Education and Local Government .\nBy March 1905 Aston Webb , the architect of the Cromwell Road extension to the Victoria and Albert Museum had commissioned over twenty sculptors to provide statues , carvings and decorations for the facade of the building . Webb allocated what he considered the\nmost prominent areas to Drury and George Frampton . The area over the main entrance arch was assigned to Frampton who created spandrel figures of Truth and Beauty for the space . The area under the arch and the remainder of the main entrance were allocated to Drury . Within the curve of entrance arch he created nine low-relief panels featuring kneeling or crouching female figures holding plaques with gold lettering that when read together form a quotation from Sir Joshua Reynolds . Below the arch , and immediately above the main entrance , is his statue of Albert , Prince Consort and above the arch is Drurys statue of Queen Victoria , carrying a staff and flanked by figures of St George and St Michael . Drurys work was singled out for praise in art press reviews when the overall scheme was completed in 1908 . The same year Webb commissioned Drury to produce a relief panel , of children at play , for the new offices of the Grand Trunk Railway Company in Cockspur Street in central London .\nExhibition record .\nDrury was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1900 and a full Academician in 1913 . He exhibited works at the Academy each year from 1885 to 1942 and at the Royal Scottish Academy between 1903 and 1917 . He also showed works at the Aberdeen Artists Society , the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and at Leeds City Art Gallery on a regular basis . He was also a member of the International Society of Sculptors , Painters and Gravers . In 1932 Drury received the Royal Society of British Sculptors silver medal for his statue of Joshua Reynolds in the courtyard of Burlington House in London .\nDrury died on Christmas Eve , 24 December 1944 .\nSelected public works .\nOther works .\n- The Boer War Memorial , a plaque in deep relief , in the Cloisters at New College , Oxford\n- Rhodes University ( Grahamstown ) War Memorial to the 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 conflicts , depicting a medieval knight in armour and chain mail , with gauntletted hands resting on the hilt of his sword .\nExternal links .\n- List of works by Drury on Victorian We",

    "story": "Penrhyn Castle\nPenrhyn Castle ( ) is a country house in Llandygai , Bangor , Gwynedd , North Wales , in the form of a Norman castle . It was originally a medieval fortified manor house , founded by Ednyfed Fychan . In 1438 , Ioan ap Gruffudd was granted a licence to crenellate and he founded the stone castle and added a tower house . Samuel Wyatt reconstructed the property in the 1780s .\nThe present building was built between about 1822 and 1837 to designs by Thomas Hopper on behalf of its owner , who expanded and transformed the building beyond recognition . The owner of the castle had many slaves , and was compensated for being deprived of them after the abolition of slavery with about the same sum as construction of the castle had cost .\nLater history .\nGeorge Hay Dawkins-Pennant ( 1764–1840 ) had inherited the Penrhyn Estate on the death of his second cousin , The 1st Baron Penrhyn ( first creation ; 1737–1808 ) , who had made his fortune from sugar plantations and slaves in Jamaica and local slate quarries . The eldest of Georges two daughters , Juliana , married an aristocratic Grenadier Guard , Edward Gordon Douglas ( 1800–1886 ) , who , on inheriting the estate on Georges death in 1840 , adopted the hyphenated surname of Douglas-Pennant . Edward , the grandson of The 14th Earl of Morton , was created The 1st Baron Penrhyn ( second creation ) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1866 .\nAfter the 1822–1837 rebuild a spiral staircase remains from the original structure , and a vaulted basement and other masonry were incorporated into the new structure .\nThe cost of the construction of this vast castle is disputed , and very difficult to work out accurately , as much of the timber came from the familys own forestry , and much of the labour was acquired from within their own workforce at the slate quarry . It cost the Pennant family an estimated £150,000 . This is the current equivalent to about £49,500,000 .\nPenrhyn is one of the most admired of the numerous mock castles built in the United Kingdom in the 19th century ; Christopher Hussey called it , the outstanding instance of Norman revival . The castle is a picturesque composition that stretches over 600 feet from a tall donjon containing family rooms , through the main block built around the earlier house , to the service wing and the stables .\nIt is built in a sombre style which allows it to possess something of the medieval fortress air despite the ground-level drawing room windows . Hopper designed all the principal interiors in a rich but restrained Norman style , with much fine plasterwork and wood and stone carving . The castle also has some specially designed Norman-style furniture , including a one-ton slate bed made for Queen Victoria when she visited in 1859 .\nThe 4th Baron Penrhyn died in June 1949 , and the castle and estate passed to his niece , Lady Janet Pelham , who , on inheritance , adopted the surname of Douglas-Pennant . In 1951 , the castle and 40,000 acres ( 160 km ) of land were accepted by the treasury in lieu of death duties from Lady Janet . It now belongs to the National Trust and is open to the public . The site received 109,395 visitors in 2017 .\nSlavery .\nDawkins-Pennant , an opponent of the emancipation of slaves , was after the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 compensated for being deprived of 764 slaves , being paid £14,683 17s 2d—about the cost of building the castle .\nIn 2020 the National Trust was working on a plan to include coverage about the former owners of its properties who had links to colonialism and slavery . Penrhyn Castle was built using profits made by a family that used hundreds of enslaved people . The castle today displays information about Richard Pennant , who by 1805 owned nearly 1,000 enslaved people across his four plantations in Jamaica .\nAttractions .\nGardens .\nPenrhyns attractions include a formal walled garden , extensive informal gardens , an adventure playground , picnic areas and woodland walks .\nRailway Museum .\nThe Penrhyn Castle Railway Museum , a narrow gauge railway museum . In the nineteenth century , Penrhyn Castle was the home of the Pennant family ( from 1840 , the Douglas-Pennants ) , owners of the Penrhyn slate quarry at Bethesda . The quarry was closely associated with the development of industrial narrow-gauge railways , and in particular the Penrhyn Quarry Railway ( PQR ) , one of the earliest industrial railways in the world . The PQR ran close to Penrhyn Castle , and when the castle was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1951 a small museum of industrial railway relics was created in the stable block . The first locomotive donated to the museum was Charles , one of the three remaining steam locomotives working on the PQR . Over the years a number of other historically significant British narrow-gauge locomotives and other artifacts have been added to the collection .\nArt collection .\nIt houses one of the finest art collections in Wales , with works by artists such as Canaletto , Richard Wilson , Carl Haag , Perino del Vaga , and Palma Vecchio . The collection formerly included a Rembrandt – ( Catrina Hooghsaet , valued at up to £40 million ; the Dutch Culture Ministry tried to buy the painting for Amsterdams Rijksmuseum in 2007 , but could not meet the asking price ) . The family began collecting paintings from the early years of the 19th century ; this significant collection was catalogued by the 2nd Lord Penrhyns daughter Alice Douglas-Pennant .\nCountryside views .\nThe castle has stunning views over the Snowdonia mountains , the Menai Strait and Puffin Island .\nReferences in popular culture .\nIn 2014 , David Haneke from the Welsh National Opera chose Penrhyn Castle as the location for the video design for the companys summer performance of Claude Debussys infamous opera La chute de la maison Usher , based on Edgar Allan Poes story The Fall of the House of Usher . Scenes filmed at the location were projected onto three separate screens during the performances .\nHBOs 2019 television adaptation of the Watchmen franchise shot many scenes at the castle , they also recreated the castle as a 3D model for use in CGI scenes in the show .\nA 2020 edition of the BBCs Flog It ! was filmed at the castle , and included details of the Penrhyn slate quarrys 1900–1903 Great Strike about union rights , pay and working conditions , a bitter battle between the 2nd Lord Penrhyn and the quarry workers .\nEvents .\nA parkrun takes place in the grounds of the castle each Saturday morning , starting and finishing at the castle gates . The fee to enter the castle grounds is waived for runners .",

    "story": "Oliver Ames ( governor )\nOliver Ames ( February 4 , 1831 – October 22 , 1895 ) was an American businessman , investor , philanthropist , and Republican politician who served as the 35th Governor of Massachusetts from 1887 to 1890 .\nAmess public life was primarily devoted to the vindication of his late father Oakes Ames , a businessman and U.S . Representative who was censured for his role the 1873 Credit Mobilier scandal and died shortly thereafter . His tenure in office was also marked by a divide within the state over the growing temperance movement .\nAmes was executor of his fathers estate , and took over many of his business interests . He was a major philanthropist , especially in his hometown of Easton , where he secured construction of a number of architecturally significant works by the architect H.H . Richardson and a number of properties by landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted .\nEarly life and education .\nOliver Ames was born in Easton , Massachusetts on February 4 , 1831 to Eveline Orville ( née Gilmore ) and Oakes Ames . His father was the owner ( with his father and brother , each also named Oliver ) of Ames Shovel Shop , the largest manufacturer of shovels in the United States .\nAmes was educated in the local schools , and then attended private academies in North Attleborough and Leicester . He was briefly employed at the family factory before enrolling at Brown University in 1851 . He spent three years there in a custom-designed program overseen by university president Francis Wayland .\nBusiness career .\nAfter leaving Brown , Ames entered the family business , learning all aspects of its manufacturing processes and worked as a traveling salesman .\nAmes served in the Massachusetts militia , rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel , but resigned before the American Civil War began . During the war , he oversaw the companys manufacturing department , expanding the business and making the manufacturing processes more efficient . The family also invested in railroads and other industrial concerns . Oliver became a partner in the company when his grandfather Oliver Ames Sr . died in 1863 .\nCredit Mobilier scandal and death of Oakes Ames .\nOakes and Oliver Ames Jr. , Amess father and uncle , were leading figures in the Union Pacific Railroad as well as principals in Crédit Mobilier of America , a shell corporation established by Union Pacific insiders to siphon profits from the railroads construction . While a member of Congress , Oakes Ames sold shares of Crédit Mobiler to other Congressmen well below their estimated market value . When this was exposed in 1872 , a congressional committee determined it a bribe for the purpose of influencing railroad legislation . The scandal resulted in Oakes Amess censure and he died not long afterward .\nAmes inherited his fathers fortune , nationwide network of business interests , and $6–8 million in debt related to the scandal . He was also co-executor to his fathers estate . Over a period of years , Ames was able to pay off the debts , provide more than $1 million in bequests , and divide the estate amongst the heirs .\nLegal battle with Jay Gould .\nIn 1875 , financier Jay Gould gained control of the Union Pacific , while a group of Ames-dominated Boston investors retained control of Crédit Mobilier .\nCrédit Mobilier remained mired in legal action related to the scandal , and its shares were a major component of Oakes Amess estate . The companys only major asset was a $2 million note against UP , and Ames instigated legal action to recover its value .\nGould and Union Pacific countersued and conducted a hostile takeover of Crédit Mobilier , ousting Ames from the companys board and discontinuing its lawsuit . Ames launched legal action as a shareholder , and succeeded in forcing CM into receivership in 1879 with himself as the receiver . Their legal wrangling largely subsided in 1880 , when most of the holdout shareholders were bought out by Gould .\nDuring their fight , Ames sold Gould his controlling interest in the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad , a separate paper railroad chartered to provide service in Kansas , at $250 per share . Ames made a large profit on the sale , which Gould purchased in order to assemble the pieces of a full transcontinental rail network under the Union Pacific umbrella .\nEarly political career .\nAmes entered public life intent on vindicating his late fathers memory . His early political activities included sitting on Eastons School Committee and chairing the local Republican Party committee .\nState Senator .\nHe was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1879 and saw to the incorporation of the new town of Cottage City , where he owned a summer home . He also sat on the committees overseeing railroads and schools .\nLieutenant Governor of Massachusetts ( 1883–86 ) .\nIn 1882 , Ames was nominated for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts . Though he won his race , Republican Robert R . Bishop lost the gubernatorial election to Democrat Benjamin Butler in a bitterly divisive contest . Ames served from 1883 to 1886 under Butler ( 1883 ) and Republican George D . Robinson ( 1884–86 ) .\nIn 1883 , the Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution exonerating Amess father and calling on Congress to reverse his censure . While in office , he also states divestment from the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the Hoosac Tunnel at 1/3 of par value . He was at first criticized for the relatively low price , but it was later seen to be a good deal .\nGovernor of Massachusetts ( 1887–90 ) .\nWith Governor Robinson retiring in 1886 , Ames won election as Governor of Massachusetts and served three one-year terms . A major political issues in his first two campaigns was his resignation from the state militia before the American Civil War . Ames countered criticisms by pointing out that he had hired a substitute to serve in his place and had financially supported the Union war effort .\nAs governor , Ames was a competent administrator , hiring and promoting more on the basis of merit than politics . In 1887 he signed a bill exempting military veterans from recently enacted civil service regulations , earning him the ire of the states progressives . A project to expand the Massachusetts State House was approved during his tenure , and he in 1889 helped lay the cornerstone for its new elements .\nEducation .\nHe advocated the improvement of public schools , as a counter to private religious schools . During his second term , he donated $1,000 to the College of the Holy Cross , which upset anti-Catholics in the state and cost him votes in his third election against William E . Russell .\nTemperance .\nAmes supported the work of the Massachusetts Temperance Society but was opposed to the legislated prohibition of alcohol . He became unpopular with advocates of temperance . In 1889 , the legislature passed a state constitutional amendment enacting prohibition , but it was voted down in the required popular referendum that followed .\nRetirement and death .\nIn 1888 , his health began to fail , probably due to the strain of office and his business interests . He refused to run for reelection in 1889 , continuing a party tradition of three-term governors . After leaving office , he traveled to Europe several times to relax and recover his health . He died at his North Easton home in 1895 .\nPersonal life and legacy .\nFamily .\nAmes married Anna Coffin Ray of Nantucket in 1860 . The couple had six children . Their youngest son , Oakes Ames , was a well-known American botanist and orchid expert who owned palatial properties in Boston , Marthas Vineyard , and North Easton .\nHonors .\nAmes was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1917 , by the fraternitys Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston . He is the only known member to receive such a posthumous offer .\nLegacy .\nAmes was a major financier of Eastons public high school , and it is named Oliver Ames High School in his honor . He is also the namesake of the small community of Oliver , Nebraska and of the schooner Governor Ames , in which he was invested .\nWith his cousin Frederick Lothrop Ames , Ames financed the construction of many projects designed by architect H . H . Richardson and landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted in North Easton , including Oakes Ames Memorial Hall and the Ames Free Library . The site of these properties is now the H . H . Richardson Historic District of North Easton , a National Historic Landmark District .\nAmes was a patron of sports and the arts . He owned Booths Theatre in New York City and raised funds to send members of the Boston Athletic Association to the 1896 Summer Olympics .",

His contributions have been significant in understanding ozone layer depletion , the role chemically active species play in climate change and the lifecycle of pollutants , specifically hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) and chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) . He was part of the assessment steering committee ( 2006 ) of and co-chaired ( 2010 and 2014 ) the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) /United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) Science Assessment Panel on Stratospheric Ozone .\nEducation .\nRavishankara was born in Shimoga , India in 1949 . He obtained his BSc and MSc degrees at the University of Mysore , and briefly researched at the Indian Institute of Science , before moving to the University of Florida at Gainesville where he received his PhD in 1975 .\nCareer and research .\nRavishankaras work included fundamental research on chemical processes and reaction rates in the gas-phase and surface chemistry of the atmosphere of Earth , resulting in better comprehension of ozone depletion , climate change and air pollutants .\nRavishankara began his career in atmospheric research after obtaining his Doctorate . He has researched Ozone Layer Depletion at Georgia Institute of Technology and in Antarctica . He participated in efforts to find alternatives to CFCs after the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 . His work on fully fluorinated greenhouse gases contributed to the Kyoto Protocol agreement in 1997 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . Ravishankara has also researched extensively on HFCs , work that was part of the efforts leading to the passage of the Montreal Protocol’s 2016 Kigali Amendment , aimed at reducing the use of HFCs specifically .\nIn 2004 , an NOAA team headed by Ravishankara , and two other independent teams , published a significant update of the rate coefficients for airborne chemical reactions . Earlier values were resulting in inaccurate measurement of , amongst other processes , atomic Oxygen reactions , created by the break-down of Ozone . Using laser flash photolysis , the groups studied the reaction kinetics of atomic oxygen with oxygen , nitrogen and hydrogen molecules as well as greenhouse gases . Results indicated that the actual rate coefficient values were 20 percent higher than the estimates used by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) and NASA at the time .\nFollowing research conducted by a team led by him , Ravishankara also drew attention in 2009 to the threat of nitrous oxide to the Ozone layer . In a paper published by the team in Science magazine , their research indicated a steady rise in nitrous oxide emissions by processes arising from human activity like agricultural fertilization and fossil fuel combustion .\nRavishankara was senior scientist and then director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) s Chemical Sciences Division in Boulder , Colorado .

    "story": "Hermann Fegelein\nHans Otto Georg Hermann Fegelein ( 30 October 1906 – 28 April 1945 ) was a high-ranking commander in the Waffen-SS of Nazi Germany . He was a member of Adolf Hitlers entourage and brother-in-law to Eva Braun through his marriage to her sister Gretl .\nFegelein joined a cavalry regiment of the Reichswehr in 1925 and transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933 . He became a leader of an SS equestrian group , and was in charge of preparation for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 . He tried out for the Olympic equestrian team himself but was eliminated in the qualifying rounds .\nIn September 1939 , after the Invasion of Poland , Fegelein commanded the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte ( Deaths-Head Horse Regiment ) . They were garrisoned in Warsaw until December . In May and June 1940 , he participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the SS-Verfügungstruppe ( later renamed the Waffen-SS ) . For his service in these campaigns he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940 . Units under his command on the Eastern Front in 1941 were responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 civilians during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation in the Byelorussian SSR . As commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer in 1943 , he was involved in operations against partisans as well as defensive operations against the Red Army , for which he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze .\nAfter being seriously wounded in September 1943 , Fegelein was reassigned by Heinrich Himmler to Hitlers headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS . Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitlers life on 20 July 1944 . He was on duty at Hitlers Führerbunker in Berlin in the closing months of the war , and was shot for desertion on 28 April 1945 , two days before Hitlers suicide . Fegelein was an opportunist who ingratiated himself with Himmler , who granted him the best assignments and rapid promotions . Journalist William L . Shirer and historian Sir Ian Kershaw characterise him as cynical and disreputable . Albert Speer called him one of the most disgusting people in Hitlers circle .\nCareer .\nFegelein was born in Ansbach , Bavaria , to the retired Oberleutnant Hans Fegelein . As a boy working at his fathers equestrian school in Munich , he became a proficient rider and participated in jumping events . During this period he met Christian Weber , an original member of the Nazi Party . Weber later sponsored Fegeleins entry into the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) .\nIn 1925 , after studying for two terms at Munich University , Fegelein joined the Reiter-Regiment 17 ( Cavalry Regiment 17 ) . On 20 April 1927 , he joined the Bavarian State Police in Munich as an officer cadet . In 1929 he left the police service when he was caught stealing examination solutions from a teaching superiors office . The official communication at the time was that he resigned for family reasons . Fegelein later stated that he had left the police on his own account to better serve the Nazi Party and SS . His father had started the Reitinstitut Fegelein ( Riding Institute Fegelein ) in 1926 . In Munich , Fegelein came into contact with Nazism and the SS . His father had made the institute available to the SS as a meeting place , and the training facilities and horses were used by equestrian units of the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) and SS .\nFegelein joined the Nazi Party ( membership number 1,200,158 ) and the SA in 1930 . He transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933 , with membership number 66,680 . He worked as an instructor at the Reitinstitut Fegelein and became the leader of the SS-Reitersturm , the SS equestrian group based at the facility . By the mid-1930s he took over administration of the school from his father . He was promoted to the Allgemeine-SS rank of SS-Untersturmführer that year and to SS-Obersturmführer on 20 April 1934 and to SS-Hauptsturmführer on 9 November 1934 . Beginning in November 1935 , Fegelein oversaw the preparation of the courses and facilities for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games . He was promoted to the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer on 30 January 1936 . He tried out for the German equestrian team , but was unable to prevail against the strong competition from the ( cavalry school Hanover ) , who went on to win all the equestrian gold medals .\nFegelein won the international tournament in 1937 , as did his brother Waldemar , in 1939 . He was promoted to the rank of SS-Obersturmbannführer on 30 January . On 25 July 1937 , Reichsführer-SS Himmler , by special order of the SS-Oberabschnitt Süd , created the Haupt-Reitschule München ( SS Main Riding School ) in Munich . The school was started from his fathers stud farm . Fegelein was named its commander and promoted to SS-Standartenführer the same day . Funding for the very expensive horses came in part from then SS-Brigadeführer Weber , who supported the school with more than 100,000 Reichsmarks annually . Fegelein won the ( Brown Ribbon of Germany ) , an annual horse race which in 1938 was held on the premises of the riding school in Munich . Fegelein at the time had strong ambitions to participate in the 1940 Summer Olympics . With the help of his friend ( HSSPF ; Higher SS and Police Leader ) Karl von Eberstein , he arranged the transfer of all the Bavarian State Police horses to the SS riding school in case of mobilization . His fear was that the horses would be handed to the Wehrmacht .\nWorld War II .\nIn September 1939 , Fegelein commanded the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte ( Deaths-Head Horse Regiment ) , which arrived in Poland shortly after the end of the Polish Campaign . The unit was placed under the command of the Ordnungspolizei ( Orpo ; order police ) and was split into small groups assigned to support police activities at posts throughout the Poznan district . On 15 November , Himmler ordered the expansion of the regiment from four to thirteen squadrons and renamed it as 1 . SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandarte ( 1st Deaths Head Cavalry Regiment ) . Additional men were recruited from ethnic Germans living in the General Government and further afield . As many of the officers , including Fegelein , had never attended officer training school , much of the training provided to new recruits was rudimentary . However , it was rigorous , and the men developed a strong camaraderie . Fegeleins unit was involved alongside the Orpo in the extermination , ordered by Hitler , of members of the Polish elite such as intellectuals , aristocrats , and clergy , in an action called Intelligenzaktion . On 7 December 1939 , Fegeleins unit was involved in the mass shooting of 1,700 such people in the Kampinos Forest .\nOn 15 December , the unit was split into two Standarten ( regiments ) , with Fegelein commanding the 1 . Standarte under the overall command of Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer-Ost Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger . The unit was short of basic supplies such as weapons , food , and uniforms , which led to deteriorating morale and ill health . Incidents of corruption and theft took place , particularly among members of the regimental staff in Warsaw . On 23 April 1941 , Fegelein faced court-martial charges for an incident in 1940 where he and his unit had been caught stealing money and luxury goods for transportation back to Germany . Fegeleins court-martial was quashed by direct order of Himmler . The allegations brought forward against Fegelein had included murder motivated by greed . Apparently he had ordered arrests and executions in the Gestapo prison in Warsaw . In addition to this , Fegelein was charged with having had an unlawful sexual relationship with a Polish woman . The woman had become pregnant and Fegelein forced her to have an abortion . Reinhard Heydrich tried several times to investigate the accusations against Fegelein , but each time Himmler quashed the attempt .\nFegeleins unit took part in anti-partisan fighting against a group of about 100 former Polish soldiers in the area of Kammienna–Konsky–Kielce in March and April 1940 . They killed about half the partisans and the remainder escaped . On 8 April , Fegeleins unit killed 250 Polish men in villages in the area . While in his report he described the behaviour of his troops as clean and decent , there were many incidents in this period where his men behaved in an undisciplined way , killing and robbing civilians without being ordered to do so .\nIn May and June 1940 , Fegelein , who had been promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer of the Reserves in the Waffen-SS on 1 March 1940 , participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the SS-Verfügungstruppe . For his service in these campaigns , he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940 . In March 1941 , the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte 1 was renamed to 1st SS Cavalry Regiment .\nWar against the Soviet Union .\nWith the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union , which began on 22 June 1941 , Fegelein saw active service on the Eastern Front . His unit was assigned on the 87th Infantry Division on 23 June to cover a gap in the lines of the 9th Army near Białystok . The motorized elements of the 1st SS Cavalry reached the right flank of the operational area on 24 June , but the mounted elements were unable to keep up . The exhausted horses had to be left behind and the men transported to the combat zone in lorries , while the horse-drawn artillery pieces were towed using any available vehicles . The first units to arrive crossed the Narew near Wizna and engaged the Soviets but were unable to break through . They were ordered to retreat and move further north . Infantry elements of the 87th Division captured Osowiec Fortress on 26 June , and Fegeleins cavalry was sent on a reconnaissance mission to the south-east . Himmler , unwilling to have his SS units under Wehrmacht control or used in combat other than as reserves , withdrew the SS cavalry from control of the 87th Division on 27 June . The ambitious Fegelein stressed in his reports that he believed his unit was combat ready and exaggerated its contribution to the operation . Ten of his men received the Iron Cross , Second Class for their efforts , and Fegelein was awarded the Iron Cross , First Class .\nThe engagement demonstrated the shortcomings of the cavalry units in modern mobile warfare , which requires quick redeployments in ever-changing conditions . Fegelein sought to improve this by asking Himmler to combine the 1st and 2nd SS cavalry regiments into a brigade , with additional support units . As a temporary measure , Himmler assigned Fegelein to be in charge of both regiments . Fegeleins unit was one of several that undertook field training and political indoctrination in the coming weeks . Himmler addressed the 1st Cavalry on 5 July , offering the opportunity for any men unwilling to participate in the upcoming special tasks to transfer to another unit . Nobody took advantage of this offer , at least partly because Himmler did not say that the upcoming assignment included the mass shooting of unarmed civilians .\nOn 19 July 1941 , Himmler assigned Fegeleins regiments to the general command of HSSPF Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski for the systematic combing of the Pripyat swamps , an operation designed to round up and exterminate Jews , partisans and civilians in that area of Byelorussian SSR . Himmlers orders for the operation were passed to Fegelein via SS-Brigadefuhrer , who met with him and Bach-Zelewski on 28 July in their new quarters at Liakhovichi in Byelorussia . General instructions were given to cleanse the area of partisans and Jewish collaborators . Jewish women and children were to be driven away . Fegelein interpreted these orders as follows : Enemy soldiers in uniform were to be taken prisoner , and those found out of uniform were to be shot . Jewish males , with the exception of a few skilled workers such as doctors and leather workers , would be shot . Fegelein split the territory to be covered into two sections divided by the Pripyat River , with the 1st Regiment taking the northern half and the 2nd Regiment the south . The regiments worked their way from east to west through their assigned territory , and filed daily reports on the number of people killed and taken prisoner . In a meeting with Bach-Zelewski on 31 July , Himmler announced the amalgamation of the two regiments into the SS Cavalry Brigade . Additional units such as a bicycle reconnaissance detachment were formed and added to the brigades complement . On 5 August Himmler assigned leadership of the brigade to Fegelein .\nHimmler notified Fegelein by telegram on 1 August that the numbers killed were far too low . A few days later , Himmler issued regimental order no . 42 , which called for all male Jews over the age of 14 to be killed . The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned . Thus Fegeleins units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities . As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps , it proved impractical to drown the women and children , so they were shot . Fegeleins final report on the operation , dated 18 September 1941 , states that they killed 14,178 Jews , 1,001 partisans , 699 Red Army soldiers , with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead , 36 wounded , and 3 missing . The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700 .\nFegelein received the Infantry Assault Badge on 2 October . Four days later , he was again brought before a court for of captured goods . Again the prosecution was halted by Himmler . In mid-October 1941 , the brigade left Byelorussia and moved first to Toropets and then on to Rogachev by train , where they were subordinated to Army Group Centre . The new operational area had more partisan activity than the Pripyat swamps , with guerrillas who were well organised and difficult to find . Fegeleins report for the period between 18 October and 18 November 1941 shows 3,018 partisans and Red Army soldiers killed and 122 taken prisoner . However , as fewer than 200 weapons were captured , historians Martin Cüppers and Henning Pieper conclude that the majority of those killed must have been unarmed civilians . Brigade losses were seven dead and nine wounded .\nArmy Group Centre renewed their offensive on Moscow in mid-November . Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade were held back as an operational reserve in the rearward area of the 9th Army . Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line , and the brigade was called in to fight at the front on 28 December . While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent to one or two divisions , in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point , of which 1,800 were ready for action . The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps , where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev . The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses , with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons .\nOn 1 February 1942 , Fegelein was promoted to SS-Standartenführer in the Waffen-SS and transferred from the reserve force to active service . Four days later , on 5 February , Fegelein on his own initiative led an attack on a strong enemy group northwest of Chertolino . The attack , carried out in difficult weather conditions , secured an important road junction and the railway station at Chertolino . In a nocturnal attack on 9 February , the brigade encircled and destroyed enemy forces at Chertolino , killing 1,800 Red Army soldiers . Yershovo was captured on 14 February , leading to the annihilation of the enemy units in Rzhevsky District . For his leadership in these battles , Fegelein was awarded the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross on 2 March 1942 . Fegelein was then granted home leave and was appointed Inspector of Cavalry and Transportation ( ) in the SS-Führungshauptamt on 1 May 1942 . In this position he was awarded the Eastern Front Medal and the War Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords , both on 1 September 1942 . The SS Cavalry Brigade was disbanded in March 1942 and the remaining men and equipment were formed into a battalion-strength unit called Kampfgruppe Zehender , commanded by SS-Sturmbannführer August Zehender .\nFegelein returned to the front line on 1 December 1942 and on the same day promoted to SS-Oberführer . He was given command of Kampfgruppe Fegelein , based in the great bend of the Don . He was wounded in action by Soviet snipers on 21 and 22 December 1942 .\nOn 20 April 1943 , he was appointed commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer . Fegelein and his division were involved in operations against partisans in May to July 1943 , which included Operation Weichsel , Operation Zeithen , and Operation Seydlitz . On 17 May , they annihilated a partisan group south west of Novoselki . He personally blew up a bunker in the attack . A week later , on 24 May , the division attacked another partisan strongpoint , and no prisoners were taken . During Weichsel ( 27 May – 10 June 1943 ) he reported the unit had killed 4,018 persons and deported 18,860 , confiscated 21,000 cattle , and destroyed 61 villages southwest of Gomel . During Zeithen ( 13–16 June 1943 ) they destroyed a further 63 villages and ( under direct orders from Hitler ) killed all suspected partisans . During Seydlitz ( 26 June – 27 July 1943 ) he reported the destruction of 96 additional villages , with 5,016 killed and 9,166 deported and 19,941 cattle confiscated .\nThe division was then deployed in defensive operations against massed Soviet attacks . From 26 August to 15 September , the division repulsed five attacks of divisional strength and a further 85 attacks of battalion strength . The heaviest combat occurred on 26 August near Bespalovka and on 28 August , when the division halted a Soviet breakthrough at Bolshaya Gomolsha . Fegelein led a counterattack on 8 September , recapturing the height 199,0 at Verkhniy Bishkin . On 11 September 1943 , during these defensive battles , he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze . Fegelein was severely wounded on 30 September 1943 and was hospitalised for a few weeks . He received the German Cross in gold on 1 November 1943 . Following his convalescence he was appointed chief of Amt VI—Office for Rider and Driver Training—in the SS-Führungshauptamt on 1 January 1944 .\nAt the same time , Himmler assigned him to Hitlers headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS . He was promoted to the rank of SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS on 10 June 1944 . On 20 July 1944 , Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitlers life at the Wolfs Lair headquarters in Rastenburg , East Prussia and received a minor wound to his left thigh from the bomb blast . Fegelein often showed around the photographs of the hanged men who had been executed as a result of this failed assassination attempt .\nMarriage .\nFegeleins politically motivated marriage to Gretl Braun , Eva Brauns sister , took place on 3 June 1944 in Salzburg . Historians Kershaw and Shirer believe he courted Braun as a way to advance his career . Hitler , Himmler , and Martin Bormann acted as witnesses at the ceremony . A two-day celebration was then held at Hitlers and Bormanns Obersalzberg mountain homes and the Eagles Nest . Fegelein was a known playboy and had many extramarital affairs . Hitlers secretaries , Christa Schroeder and Traudl Junge , state Fegelein was popular socially , particularly with women . He could be funny , amusing , and charming . Eva was glad to have someone in the entourage with whom she could dance and flirt , as Hitler was distant in social situations and refrained from publicly showing affection . Fegelein worked hard to develop a friendship with Hitlers powerful private secretary , Martin Bormann . Fegelein consistently attended Bormanns drinking parties and told Junge that the only things that mattered were his career and a life full of fun .\nDeath .\nBy early 1945 , Germanys military situation was on the verge of total collapse . Hitler , presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich , retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 . To the Nazi leadership , it was clear that the Battle of Berlin would be the final battle of the war . Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 ( Hitlers birthday ) . By the evening of 21 April , Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city . By 27 April , Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany .\nOn 27 April 1945 , Reichssicherheitsdienst ( RSD ) deputy commander SS-Obersturmbannführer Peter Högl was sent out from the Reich Chancellery to find Fegelein , who had abandoned his post at the Führerbunker after deciding he did not want to join a suicide pact . Fegelein was located by the RSD squad in his Berlin apartment , wearing civilian clothes and preparing to flee to Sweden or Switzerland . He was carrying cash—German and foreign—and jewellery , some of which belonged to Braun . Högl found a briefcase containing documents with evidence of Himmlers attempted peace negotiations with the Western Allies . According to most accounts , Fegelein was intoxicated when arrested and taken back to the Führerbunker . He was kept in a makeshift cell until the evening of 28 April . That night , Hitler was informed of the BBC broadcast of a Reuters news report about Himmlers attempted negotiations with the western Allies via Count Bernadotte . Hitler flew into a rage about this apparent betrayal and ordered Himmlers arrest . Sensing a connection between Fegeleins disappearance and Himmlers betrayal , Hitler ordered SS-Gruppenführer Heinrich Müller to interrogate Fegelein as to what he knew of Himmlers plans . Thereafter , according to Otto Günsche ( Hitlers personal adjutant ) , Hitler ordered that Fegelein be stripped of all rank and to be transferred to Kampfgruppe Mohnke to prove his loyalty in combat . Günsche and Bormann expressed their concern to Hitler that Fegelein would only desert again . Hitler then ordered Fegelein court-martialed .\nJournalist James P . ODonnell , who conducted extensive interviews in the 1970s , provides one account of what happened next . SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke , who presided over the court martial for desertion , told ODonnell that Hitler ordered him to set up a tribunal . Mohnke arranged for a court martial panel , which consisted of generals Wilhelm Burgdorf , Hans Krebs , SS-Gruppenführer Johann Rattenhuber , and himself . Fegelein , still drunk , refused to accept that he had to answer to Hitler , and stated that he was responsible only to Himmler . Fegelein was so drunk that he was crying and vomiting ; he was unable to stand up , and even urinated on the floor . Mohnke was in a quandary , as German military and civilian law both require a defendant to be of sound mind and to understand the charges against them . Although Mohnke was certain Fegelein was guilty of flagrant desertion , it was the opinion of the judges that he was in no condition to stand trial , so Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned the defendant over to General Rattenhubers security squad . Mohnke never saw Fegelein again .\nAn alternative scenario of Fegeleins death is based on the 1948/49 Soviet NKVD dossier of Hitler written for Joseph Stalin . The dossier is based on the interrogation reports of Günsche and Heinz Linge ( Hitlers valet ) . This dossier differs in part from the accounts given by Mohnke and Rattenhuber . After the intoxicated Fegelein was arrested and taken back to the Führerbunker , Hitler at first ordered Fegelein to be transferred to Kampfgruppe Mohnke to prove his loyalty in combat . Günsche and Bormann expressed their concern to Hitler that Fegelein would desert again . Hitler then ordered Fegelein to be demoted and court-martialed by a court led by Mohnke . At this point the accounts differ , as the NKVD dossier states that Fegelein was court-martialed on the evening of 28 April , by a court headed by Mohnke , SS-Obersturmbannführer Alfred Krause , and SS-Sturmbannführer Herbert Kaschula . Mohnke and his fellow officers sentenced Fegelein to death . That same evening , Fegelein was shot from behind by a member of the Sicherheitsdienst . Based on this stated chain of events , author Veit Scherzer concluded that Fegelein , according to German law , was deprived of all honours and honorary signs and must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient of the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross .\nFegeleins wife was then in the late stages of pregnancy ( the baby was born on 5 May ) . Hitler considered releasing him without punishment or assigning him to Mohnkes troops . Junge—an eye-witness to bunker events—stated that Braun pleaded with Hitler to spare her brother-in-law and tried to justify Fegeleins actions . Junge said Fegelein was taken to the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April , and was shot like a dog . Rochus Misch , who was the last survivor from the Führerbunker , disputed aspects of this account in a 2007 interview with Der Spiegel . According to Misch , Hitler did not order Fegeleins execution , only his demotion . Misch claimed to know the identity of Fegeleins killer , but refused to reveal his name .\nAssessment .\nHistorians William L . Shirer and Ian Kershaw characterise Fegelein as cynical and disreputable ; Albert Speer called him one of the most disgusting people in Hitlers circle . Fegelein was an opportunist who ingratiated himself with Himmler , who in return granted him the best assignments—mostly related to cavalry—and rapid promotion through the ranks . The historian Henning Pieper , who studied the period up until March 1942 , notes Fegeleins lack of formal training as an officer led to deficiencies in the way the SS Cavalry Brigade was prepared for active service . Fegelein repeatedly over-stated the combat readiness of his troops and exaggerated their accomplishments , in Piepers opinion in order to be seen as a leader worthy of promotion and honours . Fegeleins faulty analysis of his brigades readiness led to their use in December 1941 through March 1942 in combat situations for which they were unsuitable and untrained ; however , as the military situation was deteriorating , they would eventually have received front-line assignments regardless of their readiness . By the end of March 1942 , the brigade had suffered casualties of 50 per cent , much higher than army units deployed in the same area .\nFegeleins parents and his brother Waldemar survived the war . Gretl , who inherited some of Evas valuable jewellery , also survived the war . She gave birth to a daughter ( named Eva Barbara Fegelein , after her late aunt ) on 5 May 1945 . Eva Fegelein killed herself on 25 April 1971 after her boyfriend died in a car accident . Gretl Braun-Fegelein moved to Munich and remarried in 1954 . She died in 1987 , aged 72 .\nAwards and decorations .\n- Olympic Games Decoration ( 1st Class )\n- German Equestrian Badge ( gold )\n- German Sports Badge ( bronze )\n- SA Sports Badge ( bronze )\n- Nazi Party Long Service Award ( bronze )\n- General Assault Badge ( silver )\n- Infantry Assault Badge ( silver )\n- Close Combat Clasp ( silver )\n- Wound Badge ( silver )\n- Wound Badge of 20 July 1944 ( silver )\n- Iron Cross ( 1939 )\n- 2nd Class ( 15 December 1940 )\n- 1st Class ( 28 June 1941 )\n- German Cross in Gold on 1 November 1943 as SS-Brigadeführer and Generalmajor of the Waffen-SS in the SS-Kavallerie-Division\n- Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords\n- Knights Cross on 2 March 1942 as SS-Standartenführer and commander of the SS-Kavallerie-Brigade\n- 157th Oak Leaves on 22 December 1942 as SS-Oberführer and commander of a Kampfgruppe\n- 83rd Swords on 30 July 1944 as SS-Gruppenführer and Generalleutnant of the Waffen-SS and commander of the 8 .

    "story": "Surin Pitsuwan\nSurin Pitsuwan ( ; ; Yawi : سورين عبدالحاليم بن اسماعيل ڤيتسووان ; October 28 , 1949 – November 30 , 2017 ) was a Thai politician . He was a Thai Malay from Nakhon Si Thammarat .\nEarly years .\nSurin studied at Thammasat University , Thailand , where he received his BA in political science . He graduated cum laude from Claremont Mens College , California , in political science in 1972 . With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation , he went on to pursue his studies at Harvard University , receiving his MA in 1974 . He spent one and a half years studying Arabic and doing research at the American University in Cairo , Egypt , from 1975 to 1977 . From 1977 to 1980 , he was a researcher for the Human Rights Studies Program , Thai Studies Institute , and the Ford Foundation at Thammasat University . He became a congressional fellow under the sponsorship of the American Political Science Association ( APSA ) from 1983-1984 , working in the US capitol . During this period he taught international relations at the American University in Washington , D.C. . He returned to Harvard to complete his PhD in 1982 . His dissertation was entitled , Islam and Malay Nationalism .\nPolitical career .\nSurin Pitsuwan was elected member of parliament from Nakhon Si Thammarat for the first time in 1986 and became secretary to the Speaker of the House of Representatives the same year . In 1988 , he was appointed assistant secretary to the Minister of Interior . From 1992 until 1995 , he served as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs before becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1997 , serving in this capacity until 2001 . Surin Pitsuwan was chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) Regional Forum from 1999 until 2000 .\nIn addition to his political career , Surin taught at Thammasat University and wrote for two English daily newspapers in Bangkok between 1980 and 1992 . He was academic assistant to the Dean of the Faculty of Political Science and later to the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs at Thammasat University from 1985 to 1986 .\nASEAN Secretary-General .\nOn 18 June 2007 , the Thai cabinet unanimously endorsed the recommendation of the Thai Foreign Ministry that Surin Pitsuwan be nominated as the Thai candidate for Secretary-General of ASEAN . He was confirmed by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers during their 40th annual meeting in Manila in July 2007 and succeeded Ong Keng Yong from Singapore on 1 January 2008 . His term of office was five years . The Economist magazine , commenting that most secretaries-general are usually a senior regional official rewarded with the post as the crowning boondoggle in a career of not rocking the boat , states that Surin is different in that he seeks an activist role in member states . Surin Pitsuwan was the first ASEAN Secretary-General with significant political experience .\nOn 1 January 2013 , he handed over his post to Le Luong Minh , the next ASEAN Secretary-General . On 17 January he announced that he would be ready to take over Thailands education ministry if given the chance .\nSurins tenure at ASEAN saw the rise of the regional organization into an important global player in international affairs . He will be a hard act to follow , said Professor Amitav Acharya of the American University in Washington D.C . Under Surins stewardship , Acharya said , ASEAN moved away from the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of member states that had been used by some to deflect criticisms of their human rights records , and the grouping succeeded in setting up its own Human Rights Commission . The change in direction followed Surins advocacy of a policy of flexible engagement towards Myanmar when he was Foreign Minister from 1997 through 2000 . The policy called for increasing interactions with Myanmar leaders when they took steps towards reform , and building people-to-people contacts between nations . Prior to that , ASEAN had been criticized by some for its policy of constructive engagement , which detractors said was simply a cover for business persons to ignore government repression . Acharya said that Surin would be remembered for guiding the grouping through challenging times , including the opening up of Myanmar , the United States entry into the East Asia Summit , and rising tensions over the South China Sea . He was the most active , open and globalized ASEAN secretary-general ever , he said . An editorial in the Jakarta Post lauded Surin as the most effective of the 12 secretary-generals in the groups history .\nAffiliations .\nSince 2003 , he was a member of the board of trustees for The Asia Foundation .\nSince October 2013 , Surin served as on the board of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue ( HD ) , a private diplomacy organization whose mission is to prevent armed violence through mediation and dialogue .\nSurin was a member of the Commission on Human Security , a member of the Advisory Board of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty , and a member of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization .\nSurins eldest son , Fuadi Pitsuwan , announced the formation of the Surin Pitsuwan Foundation in 2019 . The foundation will focus on three areas : education , diplomacy , and human security . The foundation will provide scholarships to ASEAN students to study abroad , within and without the region , to spur ASEAN integration and encourage academic excellence . The foundation will fund diplomacy programs in interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution to further ASEAN integration . On human security , the foundation will assist in disaster relief and respond to development needs that will help secure the future of ASEANs citizens .\nDeath .\nSurin died on 30 November 2017 of heart failure . He collapsed while preparing to address the Thailand Halal Assembly 2017 in Bangkok . He was 68 .\nHonours .\nSurin has received the following royal decorations in the Honours System of Thailand :\n- Knight Grand Cordon ( Special Class ) of The Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand\n- Knight Grand Cordon ( Special Class ) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant\nForeign honour .\n- : Honorary Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia ( P.S.M. ) ( 2015 )\n- : Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry\n- Distinguished Fellow of JICA-RI\nAcademic rank .\n- Professor Emeritus of Thammasat University\nExternal links .\n- PROFILE Surin Pitsuwan : A Bridge between East and West\n- Biography\n- Video Speech by Pitsuwan\n- Insurgency in the south\n- Malay-Muslim Insurgency Gaining Ground",

    "story": "Geoffrey Palmer ( politician )\nSir Geoffrey Winston Russell Palmer ( born 21 April 1942 ) is a New Zealand lawyer , legal academic , and past politician , who was a member of Parliament from 1979 to 1990 . He served as the 33rd Prime Minister of New Zealand for a little over a year , from August 1989 until September 1990 , leading the Fourth Labour Government . As Minister of Justice from 1984 to 1989 , Palmer was responsible for considerable reforms of the countrys legal and constitutional framework , such as the creation of the Constitution Act 1986 , New Zealand Bill of Rights , Imperial Laws Application Act , and the State Sector Act . He served as president of the New Zealand Law Commission , from 2005 to 2010 .\nEarly life and education .\nPalmer was born in Nelson and attended Nelson Central School , Nelson Intermediate School and Nelson College . At Victoria University of Wellington , he studied both political science and law . He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1965 . After working for a time in Wellington , he attended the University of Chicago Law School , gaining a Juris Doctor in 1967 . He moved from New Zealand to Iowa in August 1969 to become a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law . In his first year , he taught the newly adapted small-section courses of American Property law , Conflict Resolution , and International law . He also developed the curriculum for a Torts course to be taught during the second year of law school . This was the first course of its kind in the United States and he was granted tenure in his second year of teaching at the college . In 1972 , he left to be a visiting professor at the University of Virginia College of Law . Eventually , in 1974 , he was appointed to a professorship of law at Victoria University of Wellington , bringing him back to New Zealand . At the 1975 general election , Palmer took part in the Citizens for Rowling campaign .\nPolitical career .\nMember of Parliament .\nIn a 1979 by-election , Palmer was elected to Parliament as the member for Christchurch Central , having stood as the Labour Party candidate . In March 1981 he was elevated to the shadow cabinet as spokesperson for constitutional affairs and associate spokesperson for justice . Following Labours unexpected loss at the 1981 general election Palmer gained the social welfare and accident compensation portfolios .\nIn 1983 Palmer stood for the deputy leadership of the party . In a three-way contest , in which all candidates were from Christchurch to reflect geographical proportionality , Palmer trailed on the first ballot to Papanui MP Mike Moore . Lyttelton MP Ann Hercus was eliminated and on the second ballot almost all of her supporters voted for Palmer , who beat Moore by one vote . He became deputy Leader of the Opposition .\nWhen , in 1984 , the Labour Party won the general elections , Palmer became Deputy Prime Minister of the Fourth Labour Government . He also became Attorney-General and Minister of Justice . The new justice minister , who had promoted proportional representation as a law professor in his book Unbridled Power? , also published in 1984 , set up a Royal Commission to investigate the electoral system and propose modifications or alternatives . His Royal Commission reported in December 1986 , recommending the mixed-member proportional representation system . After the 1987 elections , when Labour was re-elected , he also became Minister of the Environment , an area in which he took personal interest .\nLeadership .\nThe most notable feature of New Zealand politics at the time was the economic change promoted by the Finance Minister , Roger Douglas . Douglas was advancing monetarist policies involving extensive privatisation of state assets and the removal of tariffs and subsidies—these reforms were dubbed Rogernomics . These policies , which contravened Labours basic policy platform and campaign promises , were deeply unpopular with Labours traditional support base , and resulted in a confrontation between Prime Minister David Lange and Roger Douglas . Lange also reneged from his promise to hold a binding referendum on the MMP system . Palmer conceded defeat on MMP at an April 1989 Labour regional conference , saying that the issue was effectively dead for the immediate future . Eventually , Douglas was removed from Cabinet , but the dispute had weakened Lange enough that he resigned a month later . Palmer , being deputy leader , took over as Prime Minister . Electoral reformers in the Labour Party kept up the pressure , and in September 1989 , after Palmer had become prime minister , the full annual conference of the Labour Party passed a remit endorsing a referendum on the principle of proportional representation .\nPalmer , however , was perceived by the public as being too closely involved with Douglass reforms . Of particular concern to many people was his work on the legal aspects of state sector rearrangement , such as his preparation of the State Owned Enterprises Act . The presence of David Caygill ( a Douglas ally ) as Minister of Finance further compounded perception that Palmer was doing nothing to address public concerns . The only area in which Palmer won praise from traditional left-wing supporters was in his handling of the Environment portfolio , which he kept when he became Prime Minister – it was his work here in initiating the resource management law reform process that eventually led to the creation of the Resource Management Act 1991 .\nPalmer later reflected on his brief premiership :\nTwo months before the 1990 elections , it was clear that Labour would not win . The perceived damage done by Roger Douglass reforms , as well as Palmers lack of general charisma , caused too many Labour supporters to abandon the party . In addition , Palmer was perceived as being too academic and aloof , reminding people of the paternalistic attitude that Douglas was accused of . Palmer was replaced by Mike Moore , who Labour believed would give it a better chance of winning . Palmer stated he had been prepared to lead the party to a likely defeat but was just as happy to step aside : I was actually pretty pleased to get out at the end of 1990 . I was quite happy to run through as PM and take the defeat , but if other people wanted to do it — be my guest !\nPalmer also chose to retire from parliament at the election , and was replaced as the Labour candidate in his seat by Lianne Dalziel . The leadership change failed , however , and the opposition National Party under Jim Bolger won a landslide victory .\nPalmer became the second Labour leader to leave the party leadership without ever leading the party into an election after Alfred Hindmarsh . Of the Labour Prime Ministers and notwithstanding Hugh Watts tenure as interim prime minister following the death of Norman Kirk , Palmer is the only one who had not also served as Leader of the Opposition before and/or after his tenure as Prime Minister .\nPalmer is currently a lecturer in the Faculty of Law at Victoria University of Wellington .\nAfter Parliament .\nPalmer later went on to serve as Professor of Law at Victoria University again . He also held a position as Professor of Law at the University of Iowa , and worked for a time as a law consultant . While at the University of Iowa he taught courses on International law and global environment issues as well as a two-week mini course about the International Court of Justice . The MMP system which he had helped promote was adopted in a 1993 referendum . In 1994 , he established Chen Palmer & Partners , a specialist public law firm he began with Wellington lawyer Mai Chen . In September 2001 Palmer became a founding trustee of Motu Economic and Public Policy Research and in December 2002 was appointed to be New Zealands representative to the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) . Palmer continued his involvement with , and teaching at Victoria University of Wellington and was regularly engaged as an expert consultant on public and constitutional law issues . His son Matthew Palmer was also a prominent legal academic and public servant , and has recently been appointed a High Court Judge .\nLaw Commissioner .\nOn 1 December 2005 Palmer was appointed to the presidency of the New Zealand Law Commission ( the government agency that reviews , reforms and seeks to improve the countrys laws ) by the Governor-General for a term of five years . During his tenure , he persuaded the Government to engage in a programme of reviewing the old Law Commission reports with a view to actioning them . This resulted in a number of existing reports being actioned . Palmer stepped down from the Law Commission at the end of his tenure on 1 December 2010 .\nUN Inquiry .\nIn August 2010 Palmer was chosen to chair a UN Inquiry panel into the fatal Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship participating in a Gaza-bound protest flotilla in May of that year . The panel included the outgoing Colombian President Álvaro Uribe as the Vice-chair , and representatives from Turkey and Israel . The report , released on 2 September 2011 , found that Israels naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law , and that Israeli soldiers enforcing the blockade faced organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers when they boarded the ship . However , the report also found that the Israeli soldiers responded with excessive and unreasonable force and recommended that Israel make an appropriate statement of regret and pay compensation .\nConstitutional reform campaign .\nIn September 2016 , Palmer and legal academic Andrew Butler published A Constitution for Aotearoa New Zealand . In this book the pair outlined their arguments for New Zealand to adopt a written Constitution , and also drafted out what this would look like . They then invited public submissions on the subject online and spent a year promoting the book and their campaign . The pair released a second book in 2018 , Towards Democratic Renewal that amends some of their proposal in the previous text and further argues their cause for a written Constitution , taking on board the response of the public . This campaign is ongoing .\nHonours and awards .\nPalmer was appointed a member of Her Majestys Privy Council in 1985 . He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1991 New Year Honours , and made an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia in the same year . In 1991 he was listed on the United Nations Global 500 Roll of Honour for his work on environmental issues . These included reforming resource management law . Palmer also sat as a Judge ad hoc on the International Court of Justice in 1995 . He holds honorary doctorates from three universities . In 2008 Palmer was one of the first people appointed as Senior Counsel during the temporary change from Queens Counsel in the Helen Clark Government .\nLectures .\n- Lecture entitled Perspectives on International Dispute Settlement from a Participant in the Lecture Series of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law\n- Constitutional change and democratic renewal on 9 October 2017 at TEDxVUW conference , Victoria University of Wellington .\nExternal links .\n- Profile , NZ History\n- Prime Ministers Office biography ( archived )\n- Law Commission biography",

    "story": "Orenburg\nOrenburg ( ) is the administrative center of Orenburg Oblast , Russia . It lies on the Ural River , southeast of Moscow . Orenburg is also very close to the border with Kazakhstan . Population : 548,331 ( 2010 Census ) ; 549,361 ( 2002 Census ) ;\nGeography .\nThe city is in the basin of the middle current of the River Ural ( near its confluence with the River Sakmara ) . The highest point of the city is .\nThe origins of the citys name .\nSeveral historians have tried to explain the origins of the citys name . It was traditionally accepted that the word orenburg means a fortress on the River Or . In all probability , the word combination orenburg was proposed by I . K . Kirillov , who was the founder of the city . In 1734 , in accordance with his project , a package of governmental documents was worked out . This was the starting point for Orenburg as a fortress city near the meeting of the Or and Ural rivers .\nOn 7 June 1734 , A Privilege for Orenburg ( tsars edict ) was ordered by Empress Anna Ivanovna . While a construction site of the main fortress changed many times ( down the River Ural ) , the name Orenburg has not changed since its founding in 1743 .\nBetween 1938 and 1957 , the city was referred to as Chkalov , named after the famous Soviet pilot Valery Chkalov , although he was not born in and never lived in Orenburg , and never visited Orenburg . In 1954 , Chkalovs 5-meter bronze sculpture was erected on the occasion of his 50th birth anniversary ; this was installed on a 7-meter pedestal in the Boulevard ( on the riverside promenade of the city , commonly named Belovka ) .\nOrenburg was unofficially called the Asian capital of Russia .\nHistory .\nIn 1734 , the Russian Empire began expanding its control and influence in Asia starting from the construction of the fortress city called Orenburg on its eastern border ( in Southern Ural ) . For this purpose , a settlement was founded here in 1735 - at the place where the Or and the Ural rivers join .\nThe initial site was chosen for settlement during the expedition of I.K . Kirilov , who initiated developmental activities in the region . He argued that the city was necessary ...for opening up transit routes to Bukhara , Badakhshan , Bulk , and to India , making it possible to receive wealth from there — gold , lapis lazuli , and garnet . After his death , a new administrator of the Orenburg expedition , Vasily Tatishchev , was appointed . He did not consider this place to be convenient for construction of the city , because it was constantly flooded by the spring high waters . This encouraged to launch in 1739 preparations for building a new town with the old name downstream the river Ural ( Yaik ) on the mountain Krasnaya ( Red ) . The old settlement was named the Orsk fortress ( now the city of Orsk ) .\nOn 6 August 1741 , the new town was founded . However , its construction did not start . The location on the mountain Krasnaya — treeless , rocky and remote from the river — was also inappropriate for building the town . A new administrator of the Orenburg expedition , Ivan Neplyuyev , was appointed .\nOn 19 ( 30 ) April 1743 , Orenburg was founded for a third time , on the compound that was once the Berda fortress , from the Krasnogorsk mountain area . In the summer of 1742 , Neplyuev personally chose a new place surrounded by forests and crop fields , where the Yaik and the Sakmara rivers meet . Now it is the historical centre of the city . The city built upon the mountain Krasnaya was named Krasnogorsk .\nOrenburg , therefore , was successfully established by Ivan Neplyuyev in its present location approximately west down the Ural from Orsk in 1743 . This third Orenburg has functioned as an important military outpost on the border with the nomadic Kazakhs . It became the centre of the Orenburg Cossacks .\nOrenburg played a major role in Pugachevs Rebellion ( 1773–1774 ) , the largest peasant revolt in Russian history . At the time , it was the capital of a vast district and the seat of the governor . Yemelyan Pugachev besieged the city and its fortress from nearby Berda from October 1773 - March 26 , 1774 . The defense was organized by Governor of Orenburg lieutenant-general .\nGeneral defeated Pugachev at Berda , and later again at ( north of Orenburg ) . Most of the city was left in ruins , and thousands of inhabitants had died in the siege . Government forces crushed revolt towards the end of 1774 by General Michelsohn at Tsaritsyn . Further reprisals against rebel areas were carried out by General Peter Panin .\nAlexander Pushkin visited Orenburg in 1833 during a research trip for his books The History of Pugachev and his famous novel The Captains Daughter . He met his friend Vladimir Dal here , who would later write the first serious dictionary of the Russian language .\nOrenburg was the base for General Perovskys expeditions against the Khanate of Khiva in the 1830s through 1850s .

When that republic was renamed Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1925 , Orenburg joined Russia and Kyzylorda became the new capital . Almaty became the capital in 1929 after the construction of the Turkestan–Siberia Railway . Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was promoted to the union republic status as the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Kazakh SSR in 1936 . Orenburg remained in Russia .\nFrom 1938 to 1957 , the city bore the name Chkalov ( ) ( after the prominent test pilot Valery Chkalov ) . The citys distance from the German invasion during World War II led many Soviet enterprises to flee there , helping to spur the citys economic growth .\nAdministrative and municipal status .\nOrenburg is the administrative center of the oblast and , within the framework of administrative divisions , it also serves as the administrative centre of Orenburgsky District , even though it is not a part of it .

    "story": "Mick McCarthy\nMichael Joseph McCarthy ( born 7 February 1959 ) is a professional football manager , pundit , and former player . He is currently the manager of Cardiff City in the EFL Championship . Born in Barnsley , England , with an Irish father , he played for the Republic of Ireland on 57 occasions scoring two goals .\nMcCarthy began his playing career at Barnsley in 1977 , and he later had spells at Manchester City , Celtic , Lyon , and finally Millwall , retiring in 1992 .\nHe went on to manage Millwall , and then the Republic of Ireland . He guided Ireland to the knockout stage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan . He later managed Sunderland , Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town . He began a second tenure as manager of the Republic of Ireland football team in November 2018 , leaving the position in April 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic having guided the team to a Euro 2020 playoff place . He joined Cypriot club APOEL as manager in November 2020 , but was sacked two months later . He has also been a television pundit and commentator , including for the BBC and for Virgin Media Television\nClub career .\nBarnsley .\nBorn in Barnsley , Yorkshire , McCarthy made his league debut for then-Fourth Division Barnsley on 20 August 1977 in a 4–0 win over Rochdale . He spent two years in the basement league , before the club won promotion . Two years later , the team again went up to the ( old ) Division 2 . A strong central defender , he was a virtual ever-present for his home town club , but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club Manchester City .\nManchester City .\nThe Maine Road club won promotion in McCarthys first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level . His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached mid-table , but relegation struck the following year . McCarthy himself would not face the drop though as he moved to Celtic in May 1987 .\nCeltic .\nHe picked up his first silverware at the Scottish club as they won the league and cup double in his first season . The following season McCarthy again won a Scottish Cup winners medal , although the club had to settle for third place in the league .\nLyon .\nMcCarthy again moved onto a new country , as he joined Lyon on a three-year contract in July 1989 .\nMillwall .\nHowever , things did not work out for the defender in France and , feeling his international chances were being harmed , he returned to England on loan with top flight Millwall in March 1990 . Despite the London side suffering relegation during his loan period , McCarthy impressed enough to earn a move and he was signed permanently in May 1990 for £200,000 . His appearances in the next two seasons were often limited by injuries and he effectively retired from playing when he took over as manager of the club in 1992 .\nInternational career .\nMcCarthy , the son of an Irish-born father , Charlie , is an Irish citizen since birth . He made his Irish international debut in a goalless friendly against Poland on 23 May 1984 , McCarthy soon became a first-choice player and featured in all three of Irelands games at Euro 88 . He went on to become captain , leading to the nickname Captain Fantastic , as per the title of his autobiography .\nThe highlight of McCarthys international career was the second-round penalty shoot-out win over Romania in the 1990 World Cup finals . This led to a crunch tie with hosts Italy in the quarter-final , where Irelands first ever appearance in the finals came to an end , losing 1–0 . McCarthy was the player who committed the most fouls in the 1990 tournament .\nIn total , McCarthy won 57 caps for the Republic of Ireland ; scoring two goals , one against Yugoslavia in April 1988 , the other against the United States in May 1992 .\nManagerial career .\nMillwall .\nMcCarthy became player-manager at Millwall in March 1992 , succeeding Bruce Rioch . In his first full season ( 1992–93 ) , he was still registered as a player , but made only one further appearance ( in the Anglo-Italian Cup ) , before he became solely a manager .\nHe took the club to the play-offs in 1993–94 after a strong third-place finish , but they lost out to Derby County in the semi-finals . During the 1995–96 season , McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant Republic of Ireland managers job , after the resignation of Jack Charlton . After a protracted period of speculation , McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996 , two days after his resignation at the club . Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure , Millwall would go on to suffer the drop ( by virtue of goals scored ) after McCarthys departure .\nHis loan signings of the underachieving Russian internationals Sergei Yuran and Vassili Kulkov from Spartak Moscow , who each received a £150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team , would later be cited as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under Jimmy Nicholl , although it cannot be proven .\nRepublic of Ireland .\nIn February 1996 , McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of Jack Charlton .\nMcCarthys first game in charge of the Republic of Ireland team was a friendly international against Russia on 27 March 1996 which finished in a 0–2 defeat .\nAfter two narrow failures to qualify for the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 , McCarthy took the nation to the 2002 World Cup held in South Korea and Japan after a 2–1 play-off aggregate win against Iran .\nHowever , their tournament was overshadowed by a very public and bitter spat between McCarthy and the teams star player Roy Keane , who was sent home on the eve of the tournament . The conflict occurred after Keane had questioned the quality of the preparations and facilities the team were using .\nDespite this furore , McCarthys team reached the second round but were eliminated by Spain in a penalty shoot-out ( after having already missed and scored a penalty in normal time ) , thus fractionally missing out on a quarter-final place . Indeed , the narrowness of the elimination meant Ireland were the ninth best performers at the World Cup , and the fifth best among European teams in the competition . In spite of this , the Keane issue remained , with the proportion of blame undecided . Many in Ireland sided with Keane – particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed – and demanded McCarthys resignation both during and after the tournament . An independent inquiry into the organisations handling of the squads preparation later commissioned by the FAI created a damning report , leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation .\nCriticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Irelands qualifying campaign for Euro 2004 . In particular , his persistence with several players and tactics that some perceived to be inadequate did him damage , as did a 4–2 away defeat to Russia and a 2–1 home defeat to Switzerland . Under mounting pressure , McCarthy resigned from the post on 5 November 2002 . During his 68 games in charge , the Republic of Ireland won 29 , drew 20 and lost 19 .\nSunderland .\nOn 12 March 2003 , he was appointed manager of struggling Sunderland as an immediate replacement for Howard Wilkinson , who was sacked after six successive Premiership defeats left the club facing near-certain relegation . McCarthy could not stop Sunderlands slide , and the Black Cats were relegated at the end of the season , but he largely escaped blame and was retained as manager . The following season , McCarthy took Sunderland to the First Division promotion play-offs , but lost in a penalty shoot-out to Crystal Palace after Palace had scored a stoppage-time equaliser .\nMcCarthy completed the turnaround of the club in the 2004–05 season . The Black Cats returned to the Premiership as Football League Championship champions , amassing an impressive 94 points . Life in the Premiership was much tougher for McCarthy though , as he was unable to spend much to strengthen the team . After a poor season and with the club 16 points from safety with only 10 games remaining , he was dismissed on 6 March 2006 . In an ironic postscript , Sunderland eventually appointed Roy Keane as their next permanent manager .\nWolverhampton Wanderers .\nOn 21 July 2006 , McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers , replacing Glenn Hoddle who had departed a fortnight before . The Midlands club faced an uncertain future after having to sell the majority of their first-team players , though despite this situation , McCarthy promised Premier League football at Molineux within three seasons . From this awkward position , McCarthy managed to collect together a team from the clubs youth ranks , and some lower league signings , and free transfers . Despite the lack of expectations , the team managed to make the promotion play-offs in McCarthys first season , but it was third time unlucky for McCarthy in them as the team lost out to local rivals West Bromwich Albion over two legs , losing 3–2 at Molineux and 1–0 at The Hawthorns .\nIn the 2007–08 season he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish , ending seventh , losing the coveted sixth place to Watford by a goal difference of only one ( although another goal would have been required to overcome Watfords superior goals scored record ) . The campaign had also seen him linked with the international positions of South Korea and his previous post as Republic of Ireland manager .\nThe 2008–09 season started well for McCarthy as he won the August Championship Manager of the Month Award , after seeing his side reach the top of the table , eventually going on to match Wolves record start to a season ( equaling the 1949–50 season ) . Wolves maintained their position at the top of the table over the following months , and McCarthy again won the Manager of the Month Award for November .\nAfter maintaining top spot since October , McCarthys Wolves secured promotion to the Premier League by beating QPR 1–0 on 18 April 2009 . The following week McCarthy clinched his second Championship as a manager after a 1–1 draw at his hometown club Barnsley . He won the Championship Manager of the Season Award at the conclusion of the campaign , his side having led the table for 42 of 46 games .\nThe following season , McCarthy kept Wolves in the Premier League , his first success at this level in three attempts . The club assured safety with two games to spare , eventually finishing 15th , their best league finish since 1979–80 , and their first ever survival in the modern Premier League . However , in the process of keeping the team in the top division , Wolves and McCarthy were fined £25,000 for fielding a weakened team for a fixture at Manchester United and thus breaking the Premier League rule E20 . The Premier League also stated that the club had failed to fulfil its obligations to the league and other clubs in the utmost good faith and was therefore in breach of Rule B13 .\nThe clubs second consecutive top flight campaign was a dramatic one . The team spent the majority of the campaign mired in the relegation zone , yet managed to defeat the likes of Manchester City , Manchester United , Liverpool and Chelsea . A final day loss to Blackburn put them in danger of relegation , but results elsewhere meant they narrowly survived in 17th place , one point ahead of relegated Birmingham and Blackpool . This gave McCarthy the distinction of being the first Wolves manager in thirty years to maintain the clubs top flight position for two successive seasons .\nThe 2011–12 season began well for McCarthy and , after three games , his team topped the Premier League with 7 points . However , results tailed off and by January they had once again entered the relegation zone after nine games without victory . That same season Wolves sold £15 million worth of players and with the board allowing McCarthy to spend just £12 million it seemed inevitable when McCarthy was sacked as Wolves manager on 13 February 2012 after a run of poor results , culminating in a 5–1 home defeat to local rivals West Bromwich Albion . At the time of his dismissal , he was the 7th longest-serving current manager in English league football , having spent 5 years and 207 days at Wolves .\nIpswich Town .\nOn 1 November 2012 , McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side Ipswich Town on a two and a half-year contract . McCarthys appointment came in the wake of Paul Jewells departure by mutual consent . McCarthy won his first match in charge as Ipswich manager on 3 November 2012 , away at Birmingham , 0–1 . This broke a 12 match winless run in the league , 13 matches in all competitions . McCarthy guided Ipswich past Burnley on 10 November – the first home win since March after a late DJ Campbell winner . The match ended 2–1 . With a win against Nottingham Forest in late November , his sixth game in charge , McCarthy had successfully guided Ipswich out of the relegation zone . McCarthys Ipswich stopped Millwalls 13-match unbeaten run with a 3–0 home win on 8 December . On 2 February 2013 , McCarthys assistant Terry Connor took charge of a 4–0 rout of Middlesbrough while McCarthy was ill . McCarthy then guided Ipswich to safety , finally finishing in 14th place . Prior to the 2013–14 season , McCarthy had signed 10 new players . McCarthys first full season in charge of Ipswich ended with the club finishing in 9th place .\nOn 30 June 2014 , McCarthy and Terry Connor agreed a new three-year deal with Ipswich . The following season he led the club to their first appearance in the Championship playoffs in ten years with a sixth-placed finish , before losing out to rivals Norwich City in the semi-finals . During the 2015–16 season McCarthy and assistant Terry Connor renewed their contracts for a further two seasons , with the option to extend until 2020 . McCarthy led Ipswich to a 7th-place finish in his third full season at Portman Road . McCarthys fourth full season in charge ended in a 16th-place finish .\nOn 29 March 2018 , Ipswich Town announced that McCarthy would be leaving the club at the end of the 2017–18 season on the expiry of his contract , along with assistant manager Terry Connor , after talks with owner Marcus Evans . He left the club earlier than expected on 10 April 2018 , shortly after a 1–0 home win over Barnsley .\nReturn to the Republic of Ireland .\nOn 25 November 2018 , McCarthy was appointed manager of Republic of Ireland for the second time in his career , replacing Martin ONeill . Robbie Keane , a legend for the national team , was appointed as one of McCarthys assistant coaches , alongside Terry Connor , who had previously assisted McCarthy at both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town .\nIn March 2019 , McCarthy won his first two games in charge , by defeating both Gibraltar and Georgia , in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers in Group D , by 1–0 .\nIn June 2019 , the national team drew 1–1 away to Denmark , before defeating Gibraltar once again , this time by 2–0 , at the Aviva Stadium ; four days later , McCarthy guided them to the top the Group D table , having taken ten points after four games .\nOn 5 September 2019 , McCarthys side once again came from behind to draw 1–1 with Switzerland , which enabled them to remain at the top of their qualifying group , with three matches to play remaining . On 4 April 2020 , amid the global coronavirus pandemic , McCarthy stood down as manager and was immediately replaced by Stephen Kenny , who had been in charge of the nations under-21s .\nAPOEL .\nMcCarthy joined Cypriot First Division club APOEL as manager on 2 November 2020 ; he signed a contract until 2022 . He was sacked by the club on 5 January 2021 following a run of 2 wins , 1 draw and 5 defeats in his 8 games in charge .\nCardiff City .\nOn 22 January 2021 , McCarthy was appointed as manager of Cardiff City , following the sacking of Neil Harris . He signed a contract until the end of the season . His reign started with games against two of his former teams from his playing-days ; Barnsley and Millwall - both of which ended as draws . His first win as Cardiff manager came in the following game , a 2–0 win against Bristol City . After making an unbeaten start to his reign at the club , a run that included a 6-game winning streak , McCarthy signed a new two-year deal with the club on 4 March 2021 .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\nBarnsley\n- Football League Fourth Division promoted : 1978–79\n- Football League Third Division runner-up : 1980–81\nManchester City\n- Football League Second Division promoted : 1984–85\n- Full Members Cup runner-up : 1985–86\nCeltic\n- Scottish Premier League : 1987–88\n- Scottish Cup : 1987–88 , 1988–89\nIndividual\n- PFA Team of the Year : 1977–78 Fourth Division , 1978–79 Fourth Division , 1980–81 Third Division , 1981–82 Second Division , 1982–83 Second Division , 1983–84 Second Division , 1984–85 Second Division\n- Barnsley Player of the Year : 1977–78 , 1978–79 , 1980–81\n- Manchester City Player of the Year : 1983–84\nManager .\nSunderland\n- Football League Championship : 2004–05\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n- Football League Championship : 2008–09\nIndividual\n- Philips Sports Manager of the Year : 2001\n- RTÉ Sports Person of the Year : 2001\n- Football League Championship Manager of the Month : March 2005 , August 2008 , November 2008 , September 2014 , November 2015 , February 2021\n- LMA Championship Manager of the Year : 2004–05 , 2008–09",

    "story": "The One Show\nThe One Show is a British television magazine and chat show programme . Broadcast live on BBC One weeknights at 7:00 pm , it features topical stories and studio guests . It is currently co-hosted by Alex Jones , Jermaine Jenas and Ronan Keating . Various reporters also assist with subject-specific presenting , both in the studio and on location , or through filmed segments . Originally produced in Birmingham and then in the BBC Media Village in White City , London , since 2014 the studio has been based in Broadcasting House , the BBCs headquarters in London .\nLaunched with a pilot series in 2006 , leading to a full series from 2007 , it has had various previous permanent and temporary hosts . After initial low ratings , the partnership of Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley from 2007 to 2010 has been credited with boosting ratings and establishing the show as a popular staple of British viewing . The longest-serving partnership was between Jones and Matt Baker , who hosted together between 2011 and 2020 .\nThe programme is usually 30 minutes long , although it is occasionally extended to an hour . It runs all year round , apart from a two-week break at Christmas and a four-week summer holiday , with the summer slot filled with a highlights show , The One Show : Best of British , presented by Matt Allwright and Lucy Siegle .\nLaunching the full series represented a major financial commitment for the BBC , and was seen by it as a first test of a wide-ranging restructuring of the BBCs production arm into a more flexible and creative organisation , with the show seen as a potential platform for piloting other programme ideas .\nFormat .\nAs a topical magazine programme , The One Show covers a variety of stories , ranging from light-hearted humour to serious issues or tragic current events . The broadcast features a mix of in-studio presenting , outside live broadcasting , and pre-recorded segments . Reporters and other experts are included to provide contributions on various topics , both in the studio and as part of segments . Special guests are usually introduced at the top of the show , and remain throughout , often being encouraged to interact with it in various ways , as opposed to simply answering questions .\nInside the studio , videotaping is done in front of a small standing audience , and focuses on two sofas ( one for the two presenters , one for guests and contributors ) arranged around a coffee table , often serving a practical use , e.g . during food tasting . Use of the forecourt of Broadcasting House for outside live broadcasts is common , allowing for a larger audience and/or a bigger stage for a performance or demonstration .\nThe show often takes an active part in events such as Comic Relief/Sport Relief and Children in Need . Cross-promotion of other BBC shows is common , although under BBC rules the show cannot give the BBC preferential coverage .\nHistory .\nThe One Show was initially commissioned for a four-week trial run . It was broadcast on weeknights at 6:55 pm between 14 August and 8 September 2006 . The programme was billed as a topical magazine show that was to showcase stories of interest from around the United Kingdom . The trial was hosted by Adrian Chiles and Nadia Sawalha , featuring reports from a variety of people across the UK .

This format was repeated ( albeit for the usual 30-minute duration ) on 31 March 2016 as a tribute to comedian Ronnie Corbett who had died earlier in the day .\nOn 17 May 2016 , the show broadcast a 25-minute EastEnders special , EastEnders : Last Orders , to mark the end of the era of the character Peggy Mitchell , who was to be leaving the soap for the final time ; the show went out live from Albert Square , with cast members talking about Peggy and the show itself .\nOn 6 January 2017 , Jones presented her last show before going on maternity leave ; guest presenters Angela Scanlon and Michelle Ackerley began to take over for Jones effective 9 January . Jones called into the show on 26 January to announce that she had given birth to a baby boy .\nIn April 2019 , Jones went on maternity leave for the second time , giving birth on 13 May to a baby boy .

Matt Baker left on 31 March 2020 , and the BBC confirmed that he would not be replaced , with the programme instead relying on guest hosts to present alongside Jones on a permanent basis . However on 29 April 2021 , it was confirmed that the rotating guest hosts would be replaced by Jermaine Jenas who will host Monday through Wednesday , and Ronan Keating who will host on Thursday and Friday , from the week of 10 May . Both Jenas and Keating had appeared as guest hosts since the latter half of 2020 , with Keating having also co-hosted an episode in 2017 .\nProduction .\nThe pilot show was transmitted from a temporary studio built at The Mailbox complex in Birmingham . It was produced by BBC Birmingham , with production input from various BBC regions . When The One Show returned for a full series , it was moved to BBC Media Village in White City , London , in 2007 . It moved again to Broadcasting House in January 2014 .\nOn 23 February 2011 , the fire alarm at the BBC White City studios went off , causing the programme to be taken off air and the remainder of the show was replaced with a recording of Nigel Slaters Simple Suppers .\nRatings .\nIn 2014 , the show was attracting an average daily audience of 5 million viewers . It received its lowest ever audience on Friday 24 June 2011 , with just 1.92 million tuning in ; the reason for this unusually low figure was because the show was unexpectedly moved to BBC Two after a Wimbledon match overran . The trend to a Friday ratings slump coincided with Evans being handed the role of co-host for the pre-weekend edition in early 2011 . The show shed two million viewers for the Friday edition after Evans joined the programme .\nThe show reached a 12-month-high audience on 18 January 2013 of 5.83 million viewers .\nPopular culture .\nA popular unofficial companion podcast The The One Show Show launched in 2018 .

It was made during a private conversation between her , presenter Adrian Chiles and guest , comedian Jo Brand , but the comment was subsequently reported to BBC staff .

The One Show apologised for the suicide comment . The incident registered 763 complaints to regulator OFCOM , the third highest recorded in 2011 .\nJimmy Carr .\nTwo jokes told by comedian Jimmy Carr on 4 November 2015 episode were referred to regulator OFCOM for investigation regarding their potentially discriminatory nature . The jokes were found to be in breach of their broadcasting code , leading the BBC to alter its existing arrangements for ensuring guests do not swear or use offensive language , to also explicitly discourage jokes made at the expense of minorities .\nPaul OGrady .\nThe BBC received complaints that while being interviewed in January 2014 about the issue of benefit reform , the Labour Party supporter and television presenter Paul OGrady was not adequately challenged on his views , described as forthright in their condemnation of the Channel 4 documentary , Benefits Street . The BBC responded by arguing that a variety of opinions had been heard , and that balance need not be addressed simply through a single programme .\nRita Ora .\nSinger Rita Ora generated hundreds of complaints to the BBC over her choice of clothing for a 5 January 2015 appearance on the show , in which she wore a trouser suit with nothing underneath the jacket , the fit of which exposed her full cleavage . The BBC defended her clothing as being broadly in line with most viewers expectations of a pop stars choice of attire , while also making clear it would have requested a more modest outfit had she consulted with them first .",

    "story": "Ouagadougou\nOuagadougou ( , , ) is the capital of Burkina Faso and the administrative , communications , cultural , and economic centre of the nation . It is also the countrys largest city , with a population of 2,453,496 in 2019 . The citys name is often shortened to Ouaga . The inhabitants are called ouagalais . The spelling of the name Ouagadougou is derived from the French orthography common in former French African colonies .\nOuagadougous primary industries are food processing and textiles . It is served by an international airport and is linked by rail to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and , for freight only , to Kaya . There are several highways linking the city to Niamey , Niger , south to Ghana , and southwest to Ivory Coast . Ouagadougou has one of West Africas largest markets , which burned down in 2003 and has since reopened with better facilities and improved fire-prevention measures . Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso , the Moro-Naba Palace ( site of the Moro-Naba Ceremony ) , the National Museum of Music , and several craft markets .\nHistory .\nThe name Ouagadougou dates back to the 15th century when the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area . They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri , a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in Burkina Fasos history , led his tribe to victory . He then renamed the area from Kumbee-Tenga , as the Ninsi had called it , to Wage sabre soba koumbem tenga , meaning head war chiefs village . Ouagadougou is a Francophone spelling of the name .\nThe city became the capital of the Mossi Empire in 1441 and became the permanent residence of the Mossi emperors ( Moro-Naba ) in 1681 . The Moro-Naba Ceremony is still performed every Friday by the Moro-Naba and his court . In 1919 the French made Ouagadougou the capital of the Upper Volta territory ( basically the same area as contemporary Burkina Faso ) . In 1954 the railroad line from Ivory Coast reached the city . Ouagadougous population doubled from 1954 to 1960 and has been doubling about every ten years since .\nOn 15 January 2016 , gunmen armed with heavy weapons attacked central Ouagadougou at the Cappuccino restaurant and the Splendid Hotel . 28 people were killed , and at least 56 wounded ; after a government counterattack , a total of 176 hostages were released the morning after the initial attack . Three of the perpetrators were also killed .\nGeography .\nOuagadougou , situated on the central plateau ( ) , grew around the imperial palace of the Mogho Naaba . An administrative centre of colonial rule , it became an important urban centre in the post-colonial era . First the capital of the Mossi Kingdoms and later of Upper Volta and Burkina Faso , Ouagadougou became a veritable communal centre in 1995 .\nClimate .\nOuagadougous climate is hot semi-arid ( BSh ) under Köppen-Geiger classification , and closely borders with tropical wet and dry ( Aw ) . The city is part of the Sudano-Sahelian area , with annual rainfall of about . The rainy season stretches from May to September , with an average temperature of . The cool season runs from October to February , with a minimum average temperature of . The maximum temperature during the hot season , which runs from March to April , can reach . The harmattan ( a dry wind ) and the West African Monsoon are the two main factors that determine Ouagadougous climate . Even though Ouagadougou is farther from the equator , its hottest months temperatures are slightly hotter than those of Bobo-Dioulasso , the countrys second most populous city .\nGovernment .\nOuagadougous first municipal elections were held in 1956 . The city is governed by a mayor who is elected to a five-year term , two senior councillors , and 90 councillors .\nThe city is divided into five arrondissements , consisting of 30 sectors , which are subdivided into districts . Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin , Kamsaoghin , Koulouba , Moemmin , Niogsin , Paspanga , Peuloghin , Bilbalogho , and Tiendpalogo . Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area , which is about .\nThe population of this area is estimated at 1,475,000 , 48% of whom are men and 52% women . The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total , and the density is 6,727 inhabitants per square kilometre , according to the 2006 census .\nOuagadougous communes have invested in huge city-management projects . This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a cultural centre by merit of holding the SIAO ( International Arts and Crafts fair ) and the FESPACO ( Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou ) . Moreover , the villages growing affluence allows for such investment , and the populations rapid growth necessitates it .\nEducation .\nThough literacy in Ouagadougou is not high , there are three universities in the city . The largest is the state University of Ouagadougou , which was founded in 1974 . In 2010 it had around 40,000 students ( 83% of the national population of university students ) .\nThe citys official language is French and the principal local languages are More , Dyula and Fulfulde . The bilingual program in schools ( French plus one of the local languages ) was established in 1994 .\nInternational schools include :\n- Lycée Saint-Exupéry de Ouagadougou ( French school )\n- International School of Ouagadougou\nSport .\nOuagadougous inhabitants play a wide array of sports , including association football , basketball , and volleyball . There are tournaments and activities organized by the local authorities . The Stade du 4-Août is the home of Étoile Filante de Ouagadougou , the citys main Football team .\nHealth .\nOuagadougou has both state and private hospitals . The two state hospitals in the city are the Centre hospitalier national Yalgado Ouedraogo ( CHNYO ) and the Centre hospitalier national pédiatrique Charles de Gaulle ( CHNP-CDG ) . Despite that , the local population still largely can only afford traditional local medicine and the pharmacopée .\nTransport .\nMany residents travel on motorcycles and mopeds . The large private vendor of motorcycles JC Megamonde sells 50,000 motorbikes and mopeds every year .\nOuagadougous citizens also travel in green cabs , which take their passengers anywhere in town for 200 to 400 CFA , but the price is higher after 10:00 pm and can then reach 1000 CFA .\nAir transport .\nThomas Sankara International Airport Ouagadougou ( code OUA ) serves the area with flights to West Africa and Europe . Air Burkina has its head office in the Air Burkina Storey Building ( ) in Ouagadougou .\nRail .\nOuagadougou is connected by passenger rail service to Bobo-Dioulasso , Koudougou and Ivory Coast .

There are freight services to Kaya in the north of Burkina Faso and in 2014 plans were announced to revive freight services to the Manganese mine at Tambao starting in 2016 .\nEconomy .\nThe economy of Ouagadougou is based on industry and commerce . Some industrial facilities have relocated from Bobo-Dioulasso to Ouagadougou , which has made the city an important industrial centre of Burkina Faso . The industrial areas of Kossodo and Gounghin are home to several processing plants and factories . The industry of Ouagadougou is sector that fuels urban growth , as people move to the city from the countryside to find employment in industry . The Copromof workshop in Ouagadougou sews cotton lingerie for the French label Atelier Augusti .\nOuagadougou is an important commercial centre . It is a centre where goods are collected and directed to rural areas . With a large consumer base , large amounts of energy sources , raw materials for buildings , agricultural products and livestock products are imported to the city .\nThe economy is dominated by the informal sector , which is characterized by petty commodity production , and workers not necessarily having salaries . Traditional , informal trade is widespread and concentrated around markets and major roads , as well as in outlets in neighborhoods . There are also instances of modern economic practices with workplaces having qualified , stable labor forces , or more traditional forms of business such as family businesses .\nThe tertiary sector is also an important part of the economy . This comprises communications , banking , transport , bars , restaurants , hotels , as well as administrative jobs .\nTwin towns – sister cities .\nOuagadougou is twinned with :\n- Bordeaux , France\n- Briton Ferry , Wales , United Kingdom\n- Grenoble , France\n- Kumasi , Ghana\n- Kuwait City , Kuwait\n- Leuze-en-Hainaut , Belgium\n- Lyon , France\n- Taipei , Taiwan\n- Zhengzhou , China\nParks .\nThe Bangr-Weoogo urban park ( area : ) , before colonialism , belonged to the Mosse chiefs . Considering it a sacred forest , many went there for traditional initiations or for refuge . The French colonists , disregarding its local significance and history , established it as a park in the 1930s . In 1985 , renovations were done in the park . In January 2001 , the park was renamed Parc Urbain Bangr-Weoogo , meaning the urban park of the forest of knowledge .\nAnother notable park in Ouagadougou is the LUnité Pédagogique , which shelters animals in a semi-free state . This botanic garden/biosphere system stretches over and also serves as a museum for the countrys history .\nJardin de lamitié Ouaga-Loudun ( Garden of Ouaga-Loudun Friendship ) , with a green space that was renovated in 1996 , is a symbol of the twin-city relationship between Ouagadougou and Loudun in France . It is situated in the centre of the city , near the Nation Unies crossroads .\nCulture .\nThere are a number of cultural and art venues , such as the Maison du Peuple and Salle des Banquets , in addition to performances of many genres of music , including traditional folk music , modern music , and rap .\n- National Museum of Music : exhibits all the musical instruments of Burkina Faso .\n- Musée de Manega : also exhibits musical instruments of Burkina Faso , Mossi rifles and other cultural items .

It is located near the French cultural centre George Melies and features an imposing lion . A zoo called Parc Animalier de Ziniaré : located east of the city in the hometown of the president .\nArt and crafts .\nSeveral international festivals and activities are organized within the municipality , such as FESPACO ( Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou ) , which is Africas largest festival of this type , SIAO ( International Art and Craft Fair ) , FESPAM ( Pan-African Music Festival ) , FITMO ( International Theatre and Marionnette Festival ) and FESTIVO .\nPlaces of worship .\nAmong the places of worship , they are predominantly Muslim mosques .

    "story": "Amr Zaki\nAmr Hassan Zaki ( ; born 1 April 1983 ) is an Egyptian retired professional footballer who played as a striker .\nHe has played for numerous different clubs in Egypt , Russia , England , Turkey and Kuwait . Zaki has made 63 appearances and scored 30 goals for the Egyptian national team . In his career , Zaki has been nicknamed the bulldozer and has been likened to former England striker Alan Shearer .\nHowever , his career has not been without controversy . He was labelled highly unprofessional by former Wigan manager Steve Bruce . Also , his decision not to join English club Portsmouth due to the nationality of some of the players garnered much criticism in the English press .\nClub career .\nEarly career .\nBorn in Mansoura , Zaki started his career at El Mansoura . He moved to ENPPI for the 2003–04 season . At ENPPI , he became the Egyptian Premier League top goalscorer for the 2004–05 season and helped the club win its first trophy , the 2005 Egyptian Cup , as well as being runners-up in the Egyptian Premier League ,\nAfter impressing in the 2006 African Cup of Nations , Zaki caught the attention of many clubs , such as El Zamalek and Al-Ahly from Egypt , Al-Ain FC from the UAE , and Nantes from France . But Zaki later decided to play for Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow , who signed him for a reported sum of €1.7 million . However , he did not play a single match for Lokomotiv .\nIn 2006 , Zaki moved back to the Egyptian Premier League and signed to play for El Zamalek . Owing to his powerful physical displays as a forward , fans nicknamed him the Bulldozer and newspapers nicknamed him the Egyptian Gladiator .\nWigan Athletic .\nOn 22 July 2008 , Wigan Athletic completed a one-year loan deal to bring Zaki to the JJB Stadium for a sum of £1.5 million . After scoring two goals in his two pre-season appearances for Wigan , Zaki scored on his league debut on 16 August against West Ham United . On 30 August he scored his first brace for Wigan in a 5–0 victory over Premier League new-boys Hull City . On 13 September he scored his fourth goal in as many games in the Premier League as Wigan drew with Sunderland , putting him joint top of the goal scoring charts alongside Jermain Defoe . On 28 September , Zaki scored again in the Premier League from the penalty spot against Manchester City , and this goal took him to the top of the goal scorers list with 5 goals in 6 games . He followed it with two more goals against Liverpool , further solidifying his position as top scorer in the English Premier League . He also scored penalties in 2–1 victories over Portsmouth and Newcastle . At one point he was the third top scorer in the Premier League behind Chelseas Nicolas Anelka and Manchester Citys Robinho who had 15 and 12 respectively to Zakis 10 , however he failed to add to that tally in which Anelka finished top with 19 .\nWigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan likened Zaki to Alan Shearer , saying when you look at this lad and his build.. . He has the same confidence when he gets the ball , he knows where the goal is , he doesnt need to look up , he has this instinct . Strikers like that have an instinct as to where the goal is . You cant describe it , you cant give it to anybody . Former Wigan manager Steve Bruce has also been highly impressed with Zaki , and has told the press he believes he is awesome . Bruce said he put in a fantastic performance . If he keeps playing like that he is going to have a real future in the Premier League and his physique is great , he has awesome power and pace and of course he wants to score goals which is the important thing .\nControversy .\nIn April 2009 , Zaki failed to return to Wigan Athletic from one of Egypts World Cup qualification matches , leading his former-club manager , Steve Bruce , to label him as the most unprofessional player he had ever worked with . His late returns from international duty led to Bruce publicly branding Zaki highly unprofessional and fining him the maximum amount permitted , which he has done on more than one occasion ;\nBefore this latest incident , Zaki had already been fined considerably more than the average person in Britain earns in a year and he will now face another heavy fine . However , Bruce said that repeatedly fining him does not seem to alter his poor behaviour . Bruce subsequently confirmed on 17 May 2009 that the club will not be taking up the option of making his loan deal permanent .\nReturn to Zamalek .\nZaki returned to Egyptian Premier League side El Zamalek for the 2009–10 season . During the summer transfer window he turned down a move to English Premier League club Portsmouth , which had been strongly linked with the player . This has been largely criticized in the English press , because his refusal was due to the presence of two Algerians and an Israeli on the team . Zaki said after Portsmouth signed an Israeli player and also hired an Israeli football director a possible move was ruled out . On top of that , no way could I play at Portsmouth with an Algerian within their ranks . During his time at El Zamalek he struggled with injuries , sickness , goal scoring ducks , and his spot on the team .\nHull City .\nOn 17 January 2010 , Zaki passed a medical with Hull City moving to the club on a 5-month loan .\nOn 30 January 2010 he made his debut for Hull coming on as substitute for Jozy Altidore in the 69-minute . Hull went on to draw the match 2–2 with Wolverhampton Wanderers .\nAmr Zaki quoted If an offer from a decent club does not come up by the end of my time at Hull , then I will return to Zamalek . On 17 April 2010 it was confirmed by his agent that his loan had been terminated and he returned to Zamalek .\nReturn to Zamalek .\nZaki returned to Zamalek at the beginning of the 2010–11 season and gave phenomenal performances becoming the teams top scorer after scoring 3 goals in the leagues first 4 matches . However , in October 2010 Zaki suffered a career threatening injury that kept him away for the better part of 10 months . Zaki returned from injury and participated with Zamalek in the Egypt Cup , scoring twice in the semi-final match against defending champions Haras El-Hodood , thus leading his team to qualify for the final with a 2–1 victory .\nIn November 2011 , Zaki had a financial dispute with Zamalek board over his unpaid wages , claiming that he hasnt been paid over a year . The dispute lasted 3 months before Zamalek chairman , Mamdouh Abbas , paid Zaki a large percentage of his late wages . Zaki made his first appearance for Zamalek after the dispute , coming on as a second-half substitute in a Round of 64 CAF Champions League game against Tanzanian club Young Africans . Zaki scored the equalizer goal in the 74th minute , and the game finished 1–1 .\nAfter his return to Zamalek from his loan moves from Hull City and Wigan , Zaki received many offers to play abroad , including good offers from Russia , China , and France , but Zamalek kept on refusing to let him go , as he was considered one of the teams main pillars and star players .\nOn 5 June 2012 , Zaki told Egyptian sports website FilGoal that he relished a return to play in England again . This came in parallel with Egypt U-23 coach Hany Ramzy statement that Zaki may be called up to play for Egypt in the 2012 London Olympics U-23 tournament as one of the 3 allowed overage players . Zaki commented on that by saying , “I think its a good chance for me to re-appear on English grounds . It is an opportunity to be watched again . Eventually , Zaki was not picked for the Olympics by Ramzy . However , since Zamalek continued to face financial problems throughout 2011 and 2012 , Zaki started to be considered on his way out of the club as a way to bring in cash . Gaziantepspor and other Turkish sides along with some English teams and other Persian Gulf sides have all shown their interest in Zaki . On 20 July 2012 , English Championship side Blackpool sent an official request to the player to go on a one-week trial at the club . Zaki and Zamalek had accepted the trial offer , but Blackpool later pulled out of the transfer negotiations and cancelled their trial offer . Fellow Championship club Middlesbrough had also shown an interest as well . Zaki stated his desire to join Middlesbrough after speaking with his former teammate Mido about the club and insisted on a two-year contract , but Manager Tony Mowbray only offered Zaki a deal until the end of the season . Zaki turned down the offer . Zakis agent later said , Everything was agreed , his medical , his contract , his house , but Middlesbrough changed their minds at the last minute . Amr wanted to join Middlesbrough and help them win promotion , it was not about money . Amr was ready to travel . A Middlesbrough spokesman stated that Zaki was one of a number of players being chased by the club , and no offer was submitted to the player .\nElazığspor .\nIn late July 2012 , Turkish side Gaziantepspor offered Zamalek club 250,000 Euros for Zaki , and Zamalek accepted the offer on 31 July 2012 . However , speculation appeared on the bid after Gaziantepspor failed to send the official contract on the agreed deadline . Because of that , Zakis move to Gaziantepspor was thrown into doubt , and fellow Turkish side Elazığspor began to show interest in signing the player . On 6 August , Elazığspor club official Selçuk Cengiz Öztürk stated that Elazığspor have reached an agreement with Zamalek to sign Zaki according to Elazığspor manager Bülent Uygun and it is expected that he will join on a three-year deal . He later stated that he will arrive in Egypt on Monday 7 August to complete the move . On the next day , Gaziantepspor officially dropped out of the negotiations with Zamalek due to unstated reasons . Later on , Elazığspor officially signed Zaki on a two-year deal , for the same price which Gaziantepspor had previously offered ( 250,000 Euros ) During the contract agreement phase , Zaki requested to put a special clause in his contract which states that if Elazığspor get relegated to the Turkish second division , Zaki would be free to leave the club if he wants .\nAfter missing the first 2 games of the season due to registration and contractual problems , Zaki made his debut for Elazığspor in a 0–3 loss against Kasimpasa SK , coming in as a substitute in halftime . After losing 0–3 to Beşiktaş in his second game , Zaki put in a wonderful performance in his third appearance against Bursaspor , scoring an assist and scoring a disallowed goal due to Zaki being in an offside position . After that , a couple of injuries kept Zaki on the sidelines a few times , and he was able to make only 8 appearances out of potential 17 .\nNear the end of December 2012 , Zaki asked Elazığspor to allow him to leave the club , as he had received a number of offers from England , France , Ukraine , and the Persian Gulf region . Elazığspor board conceded to give up on the player for a fee of 400,000 Euros . However , no club met the €400,000 price tag that the Turkish Club had put on Zaki , and Zaki later agreed with the club board to rescind his contract due to his not receiving his wages since two months . In late January , Zaki had officially rescinded his contract with the club he became a free agent . He finished his short stint with the Turkish club without goals and with only one assist .\nReturn to ENPPI .\nAfter being close to signing with Ukrainian giants Shakhtar Donetsk in the 2013 winter transfer window , Zaki made a surprise move to former club ENPPI that surprised Egyptian and football fans around the world . Zaki had signed for 2 and half years keeping him at the Egyptian club until June 2015 . It was mostly expected that Zaki would return to his home club Zamalek once again but Zaki had explained that the Zamalek chairman Mamdouh Abbas had rejected his return to Zamalek . Twelve days after his signing with the club , Zaki and the club had terminated the players contract after a disagreement between the two sides . And Zaki was once again a free agent .\nAl-Salmiya .\nOn 18 June 2013 , Zaki officially signed for Kuwaiti club Al-Salmiya for one year and was presented to the press a few days after . He received the number 9 jersey . On his debut , Zaki scored in the league opener against Yarmouk scoring the final goal in Al-Salmiyas 4-0 win . In the third game of the season against Kazma , he scored his 2nd goal in 3 games scoring Al-Salmiyas first goal in a 3–1 win over the Kuwaiti giants . After suffering a couple injuries and some minor issues with his salary , in December 2013 Zaki and Al Salmiya agreed to terminate the players contract to prevent any more financial issues and also because Zaki wasnt performing as well as hed hoped in the Kuwaiti Premier League and wanted to move to Europe or a different Arab League . Zaki ended his stint with Al Salmiya with 2 goals and an assist from 9 matches .\nRaja Casablanca .\nOn 30 December 2013 , it was reported that Zaki was going to join Moroccan champions Raja Casablanca on 1 January 2014 when the winter transfer window re-opened . In a friendly match , Zaki broke his foot and ankle ligaments and required surgery which would leave Zaki out action for up to 3–4 months , which resulted in him missing the rest of the 2013–14 season . However , controversy broke out when the club claimed they had no knowledge that Zaki went to do a surgery on his foot , and they later expressed their anger with Zaki for not letting the club officials know that he was going to perform a surgery . Raja Casablanca and Zaki later agreed to the termination of the contract to avoid any further issues . Zaki featured in three friendlies during the clubs winter break , scoring 1 goal . He never made an official competitive appearance for Raja Casablanca . And for the fourth time in two years , Zaki was once again a free agent .\nAl Ahed .\nOn 16 August 2014 , Zaki signed a one-year deal with Lebanese Premier League club Al Ahed . The transfer was the most expensive in the history of the league to date . On 12 September 2014 , he terminated his contract with the club due to injury concerns . He didnt play a single game with the club .\nEl Mokawloon .\nIn January 2015 he signed with El Mokawloon an 18-month-contract uniting with his former coach in national team Hassan Shehata . He made his return to football after almost 400 days away from the game in round 32 in Egypt Cup .\nRetirement .\nOn 18 August 2015 , Zaki announced retirement from football via his Twitter account .\nInternational career .\nZaki played for the Egyptian National Team . In the 2006 African Cup of Nations Zaki scored the winning goal for Egypt in the semi-final against Senegal late in the second half , with his first touch moments after coming off the bench to replace a visibly irate Mido – whose argument with coach Hassan Shehata held up play and resulted in a six-month international ban from the Egyptian Football Association for the player . Egypt later went on to win their fifth continental title .\nTwo years later in the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations , Zaki scored a goal against Zambia in the group stage and another in the quarter final against Angola . Additionally , he scored another header and then added another goal in the semi-final match against Ivory Coast . Egypt again went on to win the title for a record sixth time . He was chosen in the CAN 2008 All Star Starting XI .\nAfter Egypts failure to qualify to the 2010 FIFA World Cup , Zaki was fairly absent from the national squad for almost two years due to his many injuries with Hull City and Zamalek for the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons . After American Bob Bradley took over as coach of the national team , Zaki had been called up to the squad three times ( November 2011 , March 2012 , and April 2012 ) and Zaki dropped out of the squad due to injury each time . Bradley was done with Zaki after citing an ear infection being the reason for Zaki to drop out for the third time . Media reported that Zaki was trying to avoid the national team and playing under Bradley , but he denied these rumors claiming that he ready to be called up at any time from now on . And finally after a lengthy absence from the national team , he was recalled by Bradley in October 2012 to play two friendlies against DR Congo and Tunisia . After nearly a 4-year goal drought , Zaki scored in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Guinea on 10 September 2013 , scoring the fourth goal in the 4-2 win .\nPersonal life .\nZaki is a practicing Muslim and has stated that “When I was in England I was eager to fast all the time and keep praying and also reading Quran in my spare time . He once went 24 days without eating as stated on BBC ones Match of The Day . I fasted on every day and I don’t think it affected my performance – actually I think I got stronger . I have played many matches on days which I have fasted.” Despite Zakis insistence that fasting has never affected him , it was to prove a sticking point at Wigan . “The manager Steve Bruce said to me that he understands my fast but he can’t let me play while Im fasting . “He told me that I have to choose . I chose fasting but then I played several matches without telling him that Im fasting and I also kept playing well without problems.”\nHonours .\nENPPI\n- Egypt Cup : 2005\nZamalek\n- Egypt Cup : 2008\nInternational .\n- African Nations Cup :2006 , 2008\nIndividual .\n- Nominated for the 2008 CAF African Footballer of the Year award\n- Named in the CAF Starting XI in the Africa Cup of Nations Ghana 2008\nExternal links .\n- Official website\n- BBC World Service : African Footballer of the Year 2008",

    "story": "Cory Booker\nCory Anthony Booker ( born April 27 , 1969 ) is an American politician , attorney , and author who has served as the junior United States Senator from New Jersey since 2013 . A member of the Democratic Party , Booker is the first African-American U.S . Senator from New Jersey . He was the 38th mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013 , and served on the Municipal Council of Newark for the Central Ward from 1998 to 2002 .\nBooker was born in Washington , D.C. , and raised in Harrington Park , New Jersey . He attended Stanford University , receiving a BA in 1991 and a masters degree a year later . He studied abroad at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship before attending Yale Law School . He won an upset victory for a seat on the Municipal Council of Newark in 1998 , staging a 10-day hunger strike and briefly living in a tent to draw attention to urban development issues in the city . He ran for mayor in 2002 but lost to incumbent Sharpe James . He ran again in 2006 and defeated Deputy Mayor Ronald Rice . Bookers first term saw the doubling of affordable housing under development and the reduction of the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million . He was reelected in 2010 . He was elected to the U.S . Senate in a 2013 special election and reelected in 2014 and in 2020 .\nThroughout his Senate tenure , Booker has written , sponsored , and passed legislation advancing womens rights , affirmative action , same-sex marriage , and single-payer healthcare .

Booker has pursued measures to reform the criminal justice system , combat climate change , and restructure national immigration policy . In foreign policy , he has voted successfully for tougher sanctions against Iran , voiced support for the withdrawal of U.S . troops from Afghanistan , and lobbied for increased diplomacy in the Middle East .

Booker was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 U.S . presidential election , suspending his campaign on January 13 , 2020 .\nEarly life and education .\nBooker was born in Washington , D.C. ; he grew up in Harrington Park , New Jersey , northeast of Newark . His parents , Carolyn Rose ( née Jordan ) and Cary Alfred Booker , were among the first black IBM executives . Booker has said that he was raised in a religious household and that he and his family attended a small African Methodist Episcopal Church in New Jersey . Booker has Sierra Leonean ancestry ; he learned that information when he was featured on the PBS television program Finding Your Roots .\nBooker graduated from Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan , where he played varsity football and was named to the 1986 USA Today All-USA high school football team . He graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1991 and a master of arts in sociology in 1992 .

At Oxford , Booker served as president of the Oxford University LChaim Society .

After graduation , he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project . In 1998 , Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Municipal Council of Newark , defeating four-term incumbent George Branch . To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence , he went on a 10-day hunger strike , living in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city . Booker also proposed council initiatives that affected housing , young people , law and order , and the efficiency and transparency of City Hall , but was regularly outvoted .\nMayor of Newark .\nMayoral campaigns .\n2002 election .\nOn January 9 , 2002 , Booker announced his campaign for mayor of Newark rather than running for reelection as councilman . That pitted him against longtime incumbent Sharpe James . James , who had easily won election four consecutive times , saw Booker as a real threat and responded with mudslinging . At one campaign event James called him a Republican who took money from the KKK [ and ] Taliban .. . [ whos ] collaborating with the Jews to take over Newark . In the campaign Jamess supporters questioned Bookers suburban background , calling him a carpetbagger who was not black enough to understand the city . Booker lost the election , garnering 47% of the vote to Jamess 53% . The Oscar-nominated documentary Street Fight chronicles the election .\nDuring the campaign , Booker founded the nonprofit organization Newark Now .\n2006 election .\nOn February 11 , 2006 , Booker announced that he would run for mayor again . Although James filed paperwork to run for reelection , he announced shortly thereafter that he would instead cancel his bid to focus on his work as a state senator , a position to which he was elected in 1999 . At Jamess discretion , Deputy Mayor Ronald Rice decided to run for mayor . Bookers campaign outspent Rices 25 to 1 , for which Rice attacked him . In addition to raising over $6 million in the race , Booker attacked Rice as a political crony of James . Booker won the May 9 election with 72% of the vote . His slate of city council candidates , known as the Booker Team , swept the council elections , giving Booker firm leadership of the city government .\n2010 election .\nOn April 3 , 2010 , Booker announced his candidacy for reelection . At his announcement event , he remarked that a united government was crucial to progress , knowing his supporters in the city council faced tough reelections . Heavily favored to win , Booker faced former judge and Essex County prosecutor Clifford J . Minor and two minor candidates . Booker was reelected with 59% of the vote .\nTenure .\nBefore taking office as mayor , Booker sued the James administration , seeking to terminate cut-rate land deals favoring two redevelopment agencies that had contributed to Jamess campaigns and listed James as a member of their advisory boards . Booker argued that the states pay-to-play laws had been violated and that the land deals would cost the city more than $15 million in lost revenue . Specifically , Booker referenced a parcel at Broad and South Streets that would generate only $87,000 under the proposed land deals yet was valued at $3.7 million under then-current market rates . On June 20 , 2006 , Superior Court Judge Patricia Costello ruled in Bookers favor .\nIn late June 2006 , before Booker took office , New Jersey investigators foiled a plot to assassinate him led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons . The motive for the plot was unclear , but was described variously as a response to the acrimonious campaign and to Bookers campaign promises to take a harder line on crime .\nFirst term .\nBooker took office as mayor of Newark on July 1 , 2006 . After his first week in office , he announced a 100-day plan to implement reforms . The proposed changes included increasing police forces , ending background checks for many city jobs to help former offenders find employment in the city , refurbishing police stations , improving city services , and expanding summer youth programs .\nOne of Bookers first priorities was to reduce the citys crime rate . In furtherance of this , he appointed former deputy commissioner of operations of the New York City Police Department Garry McCarthy director of the Newark Police Department . Crime reduction was such a central concern of Bookers administration that he and his security team were known to personally patrol the Newarks streets until as late as 4 a.m .\nBooker was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition , a bipartisan group with a stated goal of making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets . In October 2009 , the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave him the Sarah Brady Visionary Award for his work in reducing gun violence . During his mayoralty , crime dropped significantly in Newark , which led the nation in violent crime reduction from 2006 to 2008 . March 2010 marked Newarks first murder-free month in over 44 years , although murder and overall crime rates began to rise again after 2008 . In addition to his crime-lowering initiatives , Booker doubled the amount of affordable housing under development and quadrupled the amount under pre-development , and reduced the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million .\nAfter taking office , Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice , first by 8% early in his first year as mayor . He also raised the salaries of many city workers . But his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010 , as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year . In 2008 and 2009 , the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Associations Distinguished Budget Presentation Award . In an effort to make government more accessible , Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents could meet with him to discuss their concerns . In 2010 , Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize , ultimately placing seventh ; he was also an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award . In March 2010 , Booker won a Shorty Award in the government category for having the best microblog .\nIn July 2010 , Booker attended a dinner at a conference in Sun Valley , Idaho , where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . Zuckerberg , who had no known ties to Newark , announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million to the Newark school system . According to The New York Times , Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Bookers plans for Newark . The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education . The gift was formally announced when Booker , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show . Some considered the timing of Zuckerbergs donation a move for damage control to his image , as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network , a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg . But on her show , Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months , had planned the announcement for the month before , and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name on the donation , which he had wanted to make anonymously .\nOn October 10 , 2010 , Booker established Lets Move ! Newark as part of First Lady Michelle Obamas national Lets Move ! initiative against childhood obesity .\nBooker gained national attention on December 28 , 2010 , when a constituent asked him on Twitter to send someone to her elderly fathers house to shovel his driveway because he was about to attempt to do it himself . Booker responded by tweeting , I will do it myself ; where does he live ? Other people volunteered , including one person who offered his help on Twitter , and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the mans driveway .\nSecond term .\nIn October 2011 , Booker expanded the Lets Move ! Newark program to include Lets Move ! Newark : Our Power , a four-month fitness challenge for Newark public school students run by public health advocate Jeff Halevy .\nOn April 12 , 2012 , Booker saved a woman from a house fire , suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process . Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Bookers actions possibly saved the womans life . After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of New Jerseys and New Yorks shoreline areas in late October 2012 , Booker invited Newarkers without electrictiy and similar services to eat and sleep in his home . In February 2013 , responding to a Twitter post , Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend . Booker rescued a dog from freezing temperatures in January 2013 and another dog that had been abandoned in a cage in July 2013 .\nOn November 20 , 2012 , a melee occurred at a Newark City Council meeting Booker attended . The nine-seat council was to vote on the successor to the seat vacated by newly elected U.S . Representative Donald M . Payne , Jr . Bookers opponents on the council , including Ras Baraka , sought to appoint John Sharpe James , son of former mayor Sharpe James , while Booker and his supporters favored Shanique Speight . Booker attended the meeting to deal with the eventuality of the lack of a quorum or a tie vote , in which state law would allow him to cast a deciding vote . After acting Council President Anibal Ramos Jr . refused Baraka an opportunity to address the council , Baraka and two other council members walked away in protest . Booker cast the deciding vote for Speight . Supporters of James stormed the stage and were held back by riot police , who eventually used pepper spray on some members of the crowd . Baraka later blamed Booker for inciting the disturbance . Booker refused to comment to the media after the vote .\nIn December 2012 , after discussions with a constituent about New Jerseys Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) , Booker began a weeklong challenge attempting to live on a food budget of $30 per week—the amount SNAP recipients receive . When critics noted that the very name of the SNAP program shows that it is intended to supplement an individuals food budget , not be its sole source , Booker replied that his aim was to spark a discussion about the reality that many Americans rely solely on food stamps to survive .\nNewark Watershed .\nThe Newark Watershed comprises 35,000 acres of pristine land and reservoirs that supply water to municipalities in northern New Jersey . A February 2014 New Jersey State Comptroller report revealed irregularities and corruption within the Newark Watershed and Development Corporation , which was being dismantled after being taken over by the city during Bookers mayoralty .\nPublic opinion polling .\nThroughout Bookers mayoralty , Fairleigh Dickinson Universitys public opinion poll PublicMind asked New Jersey residents whether they had heard of Booker and whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him .

While he had high ratings from Newarkers , his legacy has received mixed reviews . During his tenure , millions of dollars were invested in downtown development , but underemployment and high murder rates continue to characterize many of the citys neighborhoods . Despite legal challenges initiated during his term , Newark Public Schools remained under state control for nearly 20 years . Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012 , requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligated the city to request and the state to approve appointments to City Hall administrative positions .\nWhile mayor , Booker claimed in an interview that Newarks unemployment rate had fallen by two percentage points . PolitiFact rated the claim false because he used data that had not been seasonally adjusted ; the adjusted rate was 0.7 percentage points .\nU.S . Senate .\n2013 election .\nOn December 20 , 2012 , Booker announced that he would explore running for the U.S . Senate seat then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election , ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election . On January 11 , 2013 , Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee without announcing whether he would run . About a month later , Lautenberg—then 89 years old—announced that he would not seek reelection in 2014 .\nOn June 3 , Lautenberg died of viral pneumonia ; five days later , Booker announced his intention to run for Lautenbergs seat in a 2013 special election . Booker announced his candidacy at two events , one in Newark and the other in Willingboro .\nOn August 13 , 2013 , Booker was declared the winner of the Democratic primary , with approximately 59% of the vote . On October 16 , he defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in the general election , 54.9% to 44.0% . Booker was the first African-American to be elected to the Senate since Barack Obama in 2004 . The night before his victory , he visited the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem M . Schneerson , offering prayers and lighting a vigil candle in memory of his father .\nBooker resigned as mayor of Newark on October 30 , and on October 31 was sworn in as the junior U.S . Senator from New Jersey . He is the first African-American U.S . Senator from New Jersey .\n2014 election .\nOn January 9 , 2014 , Brian D . Goldberg , a West Orange resident and New Jersey businessman , announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for U.S . Senate .

Pezzullo had run for the US Senate in 1996 as the Conservative Party candidate . On February 4 , 2014 , conservative political consultant Jeff Bell announced his bid for the nomination . Bell was the Republican Party nominee for U.S . Senate in 1978 . Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin , who ran for the Senate in 2000 and 2008 , announced his candidacy on February 13 .\nBell won the Republican primary and received support from the conservative American Principles Fund , which ran a direct-mail operation costing over $80,000 , and the National Organization for Marriage , an organization opposing same-sex marriage , which paid for $6,000 of automated calling . Booker defeated Bell in the general election with 55.8% of the vote to Bells 42.4% .\n2020 election .\nIn his reelection campaign , Booker faced Republican nominee Rik Mehta , a pharmaceutical executive and attorney . The election was primarily conducted by mail-in ballots , as mandated by Governor Phil Murphy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . Booker and Mehta participated in a virtual debate sponsored by the New Jersey Globe , in which they sparred over issues including the Trump presidency , COVID-19 lockdowns , the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court , and systemic racism .\nIn the November 3 general election , Booker defeated Mehta , 57%–41% .\nTenure .\nIn November 2013 , Booker co-sponsored and voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act . In December 2013 , he was one of the original cosponsors of Bob Menéndezs Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013 , which would toughen sanctions against Iran . He also voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 . In January 2014 , he cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act . In February 2014 , Booker voted against the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 . In March , Booker pledged to meet with each of his Republican colleagues in the Senate in order to find common ground , and was spotted having dinner with Senator Ted Cruz in Washington .\nLeading up to the 2016 presidential election , Booker endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination . He was considered a potential vice-presidential candidate during the primary and as the general election began , though he said on June 16 that he was not being vetted . After the election , in which Donald Trump defeated Clinton , Booker testified on January 11 , 2017 , against Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions , the first instance of a sitting senator testifying against another during a cabinet position confirmation hearing .\nBooker supported fellow New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez when Menendez faced trial on federal corruption and bribery charges . During the trial , Booker was a character witness for Menendez , giving him effusive praise . After the judge declared a mistrial , Booker argued that prosecutors ought not to take Menendez to trial again . When Menendez ran for reelection , Booker praised Menendez , saying he was so grateful for Bob Menendez and that I get to work with him and stand beside him . Booker downplayed the corruption allegations , saying to try to continue to try to throw this kind of mud at him , its not going to stick . It didnt stick when the government tried to do it and it should not stick now .\nIn 2018 , Politico named Booker part of the Hell-No Caucus , along with Senators Kamala Harris , Kirsten Gillibrand , Elizabeth Warren , and Bernie Sanders , after he voted overwhelmingly to thwart his [ Trumps ] nominees for administration jobs , including Rex Tillerson , Betsy De Vos , and Mike Pompeo ; all the senators on the list were considered potential 2020 presidential contenders .\nIn April 2018 , after the FBI raided the hotel room and offices of Trumps personal attorney , Michael Cohen , Booker , Chris Coons , Lindsey Graham , and Thom Tillis introduced new legislation to limit President Trumps ability to fire special counsel Robert Mueller . Termed the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act , the legislation would allow any special counsel , in this case Mueller , to receive an expedited judicial review in the 10 days following being dismissed to determine if said dismissal was suitable . If not , the special counsel would be reinstated . At the same time , according to The Hill , the bill would codify regulations that a special counsel could be fired by only a senior Justice Department official , while having to provide reasons in writing .\nOn September 5 , 2018 , during the Senate Judiciary Committees confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh ( nominated by Trump to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court ) , Booker questioned Kavanaugh on a series of emails marked committee confidential dating to Kavanaughs time in the office of the White House Counsel during George W . Bushs presidency . The emails , which Bookers office released to the public the next day , show Kavanaugh and others in the Counsels office discussing racial profiling as a means to combat terrorism , particularly after 9/11 . Booker said that he was violating Senate rules in releasing the documents , with the penalty including possible expulsion from the Senate ; he nonetheless defended his decision , referring to the process of producing documents for the hearing as a sham and challenging those who warned him about the consequences to bring it on .

Bolkesteins mother was born in the Dutch East Indies to Dutch parents .\nBolkestein attended the Barlaeus Gymnasium in Amsterdam from 1945 to 1951 , where he majored in both arts and sciences .

From 1990 to 1994 he was the parliamentary opposition leader and continued his outspoken and independent style when his party was part of the government from 1994 . During the provincial elections of 1995 , his criticism of Dutch immigration policies made his party the largest of the country .\nIn 1996 , his political integrity came under heavy criticism , because it was revealed he had written a letter to the Minister of Health Els Borst , in which he asked her to help a pharmaceutical company , of which Bolkestein was member of the board of commissioners .

It triggered huge protests in Europe . This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text . The principle of origin , which stipulates that workers are employed under the legal arrangements of their own state of residence , was replaced by a new freedom principle – freedom to provide services , meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed . The compromise allowed the draft Directive to continue to exist . However , there was a great deal of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare , triggering competition between various parts of Europe . This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in Strasbourg by port workers which led to damage to the building . MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006 ; 2 years after Bolkestein left office , under the Barroso Commission .\nControversies .\nIn 2001 , Bolkestein responded to the question raised by European MPs ( MEP ) Harlem Désir , Glyn Ford and Francis Wurtz , who asked the Commission to investigate the accusations brought forward by Révélation$ , a book written by investigative journalist Denis Robert and former Clearstream member Ernest Backes , and to ensure that the 10 June 1990 directive ( 91/308 CE ) on control of financial establishment be applied in all member states in an effective way . Commissioner Frits Bolkestein applied that the Commission has no reason to date to believe that the Luxembourg authorities do not apply it vigorously [ sic ] . The three MPs henceforth published a press statement asking the opening of an investigation by the European Union about the correct application of 10 June 1990 directive .\nOn 26 April 2006 , French daily 20 minutes revealed that in May 2005 , MEP Paul van Buitenen was shocked by Frits Bolkesteins presence in Bank Menateps international consultative council ( owned by Russian magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky ) , a sulfurous Russian banking establishment , and by his work for Shell , British-Dutch petrol company . Two firms detaining secret accounts in Clearstream .. . Van Buitenen , also Dutch , then asked for clarification to the European Commission and the opening of a parliamentary investigation . The Commissions president , José Manuel Barroso , answered that these facts dont bring up any new question and that it is not known if Menatep took contact with Bolkestein while he was in his functions . No investigation thereby took place . The free daily underlines that in 2001 , it was Bolkestein himself that announced the Commissions refusal to open up a parliamentary investigation on Clearstream , following MEP Harlem Désirs requests and accusations that Menatep had an undeclared account at Clearstream . Bolkestein refused to answer any questions by the newspaper .\nOn 18 May 2010 , Bolkestein advocated for the legalization of all drugs in an article called ; Red het land , sta drugs toe which translates to ; save the nation , allow drugs in the NRC Handelsblad , a Dutch newspaper . The article is endorsed by many professionals ranging from Els Borst , former Dutch minister of public health , to many jurists , professors and drug experts .\nIn Het Verval ( The Decline ) , a book about Jews in the Netherlands written by Manfred Gerstenfeld , a Holocaust survivor and senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs , Bolkestein is quoted as having said that practicing Jews had no future in the Netherlands , due to antisemitism among Turkish and particularly Moroccan immigrants , and that they should emigrate to the United States or Israel . Bolkesteins remarks , after having been published in a Dutch newspaper , raised a storm of criticism in December 2010 . According to Ronny Naftaniel , head of the Jewish organisation CIDI , this was not the first time Bolkestein has expressed this view .\nPublished books .\n- ( 1976 ) Floris , Count of Holland as Niels Kobet\n- ( 1982 ) Modern Liberalism\n- ( 1990 ) De Engel en het Beest\n- ( 1992 ) Woorden hebben hun betekenis\n- ( 1994 ) Islam en Democratie with Mohammed Arkoun\n- ( 1995 ) Het Heft in Handen\n- ( 1997 ) Moslim in de Polder\n- ( 1998 ) Boren in hard Hout\n- ( 1998 ) Onverwerkt Verleden\n- ( 2004 ) De Grenzen van Europa\n- ( 2005 ) Grensverkenningen\n- ( 2006 ) De twee lampen van de staatsman\n- ( 2006 ) Peut-on réformer la France ?\n- ( 2008 ) Overmoed en onverstand\n- ( 2009 ) De politiek der dingen\n- ( 2011 ) De goede vreemdeling\n- ( 2011 ) De intellectuele verleiding ( The Intellectual Temptation )\n- ( 2013 ) Cassandra tegen wil en dank\n- ( 2015 ) De succesvolle mislukking van Europa , co-edited with Paul Cliteur and Meindert Fennema\nExternal links .\n- Frits Bolkestein at the European Commission\n- Frits Bolkestein at Leiden University",

Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S . Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles . Watts father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party , but supported him . Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990 for a six-year term as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma . He served as a member of the commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995 .\nU.S . House of Representatives .\n1994 congressional election .\nWatts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy , who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate . He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative , favoring the death penalty , school prayer , a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform , and opposing abortion , gay rights , and reduced defense spending . After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple , Watts won 49 percent to Apples 48 percent of the vote in August 1994 , and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston . Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee , David Perryman , a white lawyer from Chickasha , with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll . Watts hosted former President George H . W . Bush , U.S . Senator Bob Dole , and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains , as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks . Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race , but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win . On November 8 , 1994 , Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S . Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction . He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House . Oklahomas Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922 .\nAs Congressman , Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee . Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrichs agenda , the Contract with America , and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus . He initially supported ending affirmative action , declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality , but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government . Watts focused on promoting his party , attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges . In 1995 , Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole .\nReelection and successive terms .\nWatts 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate in a negative campaign . Crocker questioned Watts business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner , and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock . Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives . Watts denied the charge , took the test , and accused Crocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the center of the West Coast drug culture . Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S . House election .\nFollowing the election , Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee . He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clintons State of the Union address in February 1997 , the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so . In his response , Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values . Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing race-hustling poverty pimps as keeping African-Americans dependent on government . These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington , D.C . mayor Marion Barry , and Jesse Jackson Jr . demanded a public apology . Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about some of the leadership in the black community .\nIn his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom , Watts faced accusations about debts , unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991 , where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission . Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts , and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma . Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s . He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote .\nFrom 1995 until 1997 , Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress ( along with Gary Franks of Connecticut ) . From 1997 until 2003 , Watts was the only black Republican Congressman . There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011 .\nLeadership position and retirement .\nIn Congress , Watts had established himself as a devoted conservative . He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union and a lifetime liberal quotient of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action , and was regarded as a team player by Republicans . Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998 , replacing John Boehner , after a vote of 121–93 . Watts assumed the position in 1999 and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post .\nIn his leadership position , Watts opposed government regulations and President Clintons attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products . He voted to impeach Bill Clinton , was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues , and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W . Bush . Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education , job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings , and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work . Watts worked to make his party more inclusive , promoted African trade , supported historically black colleges and universities , and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research .\nTo keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election , Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of family values that excluded single mothers . Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas . By then , Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership , including Tom DeLay , over control of the partys message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000 , due to strains on his family , who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington , but changed his mind after consultations with constituents , Hastert , and his family . He ran , despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms . Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford .\nAfter George W . Bush took office as president , Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs , and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bushs tax cut plan , targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty . Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks .\nIn 2002 , Watts stated he would not seek reelection , citing a desire to spend more time with his family , but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay . Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration , which Watts denied . Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole , who won the election to fill his seat .\nPost-congressional career .\nAfter he left Congress , Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30 , 2003 . Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm , J . C . Watts Companies , in Washington , D.C. , to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress . The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal . Watts wrote an autobiography , wrote regular opinion columns for the Las Vegas Review-Journal , and joined the boards of several companies , including Dillards , Terex , Clear Channel Communications , and CSX Transportation , and served as chairman of GOPAC .\nWatts supported the Iraq War in 2003 , stating : America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils . He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN and following the 2006 House election , Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message . He stated : We lost our way , pure and simple .\nIn 2008 , Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast , focusing on an African-American audience , and that he considered voting for Barack Obama , criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community . Reports showed he contributed to John McCain , but not to Obama .\nWatts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election , but declined in May 2009 , citing his business and contractual obligations .\nOn April 7 , 2015 , Watts joined U.S . Senator Rand Paul on stage during Pauls announcement speech for U.S . president . Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid .\nFor most of 2016 , Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children ( FTC ) . The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21 . On November 15 , the organization and Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles . The following April , Watts sued both FTC and its Board of Directors for wrongful termination . According to Watts , he was fired after uncovering rampant financial mismanagement at the charity and notifying the states Attorney General Office of potentially illegal practices . Feed The Children denied there was any validity to Watts’ claims and preceded to file a counter-suit against him . The case was settled in 2019 , after FTC agreed to drop their counter-suit and pay Watts $1 million to resolve all his claims against them .\nIn 2019 Watts began plans to start the Black News Channel , which launched on February 10 , 2020 as a 24-hour news channel aimed at an African American audience .",

    "story": "Brian Cowen\nBrian Bernard Cowen ( born 10 January 1960 ) is an Irish former politician who served as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil from 2008 to 2011 .\nCowen was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1984 , for the constituency of Laois–Offaly and served in a number of ministerial roles , including Minister for Labour from 1992 to 1993 , Minister for Transport , Energy and Communications from 1993 to 1994 , Minister for Health and Children from 1997 to 2000 , Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2000 to 2004 , Minister for Finance from 2004 to 2008 and Tánaiste from 2007 to 2008 .\nCowen was elected Leader of Fianna Fáil in May 2008 , upon the resignation of Bertie Ahern , and was nominated by Dáil Éireann to replace him as Taoiseach . Weeks after taking office , his administration faced the Irish financial and banking crises . He received substantial criticism for his failure to stem the tide of either crisis , ultimately culminating in the Irish Governments formal request for financial aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund , which was widely regarded in Ireland as a national humiliation . His leadership subsequently saw public support for Fianna Fáil plunge to record lows , and Cowen set a record for the lowest approval rating in the history of Irish opinion polling , at one point reaching an approval rating of 8 percent . In January 2011 , following a failed attempt at a cabinet reshuffle , and facing growing political pressure , Cowen resigned as Leader of Fianna Fáil , but remained as Taoiseach until the general election held months later ; Cowen stood down from politics at that election .\nThe Sunday Times described Cowens tenure as Taoiseach as a dismal failure . In 2011 , the Irish Independent called Cowen the worst Taoiseach in the history of the State .\nEarly and private life .\nBrian Cowen was born to a Catholic family , in Tullamore , County Offaly , on 10 January 1960 . He was raised in Clara by his parents , May and Bernard Cowen , a former Fianna Fáil TD and Senator . The family owned a public house , butcher shop and undertaking business in Clara , beside the family home . His father also worked as an auctioneer . Cowen often worked as a barman in his fathers pub when he was growing up . He has two brothers , Christopher and Barry . Barry Cowen is a TD for Laois–Offaly since 2011 .\nCowen was educated at Clara National School , Árd Scoil Naomh Chiaráin , in Clara and the Cistercian College of Mount St . Joseph in Roscrea , County Tipperary . He was twelve years old when he entered Mount St . Joseph College , as a boarder . After secondary school , he attended University College Dublin where he studied law . He subsequently qualified as a solicitor from the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland , Dublin .\nHe is a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association and continues to serve as president of Clara club . He also played with the Offaly Gaelic football team in the early 1980s . Cowen likes to socialise with his constituents in some of the local pubs in his native Offaly . In May 2003 , he took part in a charity CD project organised by The Brewery Tap pub in Tullamore . The CD featured 28 songs , including Cowen singing the Phil Coulter song , The Town I Loved So Well .\nIn May 2007 , Cowen told Jason OToole of Hot Press that , as a student : I would say there were a couple of occasions when marijuana was passed around – and , unlike President Clinton , I did inhale . There wasnt a whole lot in it really .\nCowen is married to Mary Molloy and they have two daughters . In 2017 , Cowen was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the National University of Ireland .\nEarly political career .\nCowen was elected to Dáil Éireann in the Laois–Offaly by-election of 1984 , caused by the death of his father Bernard Cowen . At the time Cowen , at the age of 24 , became the youngest member of the 24th Dáil . He was also elected to Offaly County Council in the same year , taking over the seat vacated by his late father . He served on that authority until 1992 .\nCowen remained on the backbenches of Fianna Fáil for the next seven years . Following the 1989 general election when Fianna Fáil formed a coalition government , with the Progressive Democrats , for the first time , Cowen was one of a number of TDs who were vehemently opposed to the move . Two years later in November 1991 , the then Minister for Finance , Albert Reynolds , challenged Charles Haughey , for the leadership of the party . Cowen firmly aligned himself behind Reynolds and quickly became associated with the partys so-called Country and Western wing . ( Reynoldss supporters earned this nickname due to the fact that the vast majority were rural TDs and that Reynolds had made a lot of money in the dance hall business in the 1960s. ) Reynolds became leader on his second attempt , when Haughey was forced to retire as Taoiseach in 1992 .\nReynolds appointed Cowen , aged 32 , to his first cabinet position as Minister for Labour . In spite of being a member of the cabinet , Cowen was openly hostile toward the PDs . This was evident at the Fianna Fáil partys Ardfheis in March 1992 . In the warm-up speech before the leaders address , Cowen remarked , What about the PDs ? When in doubt , leave them out . He fought with the PDs , being furious at their interference with Fianna Fáils view that , as majority partner , they should have wielded the power .\nThe 1992 general election produced a hung Dáil and resulted in negotiations between all the main parties . Cowen , along with Noel Dempsey and Bertie Ahern , negotiated on behalf of Fianna Fáil in an attempt to form a government with the Labour Party . A deal was reached between the two parties , and Cowen was again appointed Minister for Transport , Energy and Communications . In that role , he implemented the controversial decision to relax the so-called stopover at Shannon Airport , which allowed limited direct trans-Atlantic flights from Dublin Airport . The decision proved divisive and saw one Fianna Fáil TD , Síle de Valera , resign from the party in protest .\nIn October 1994 , it was revealed that Cowen had 1,000 shares in Arcon , a company to which he was in the process of awarding a mining licence . He quickly sold the shares and apologised in the Dáil for causing himself and his colleagues some embarrassment .\nLater in 1994 , Albert Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil . Bertie Ahern became the new leader , and initially appeared set to replace Reynolds as Taosieach . However , Labour chose to end the coalition with Fianna Fáil and took part in a new coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left , consigning Fianna Fáil to opposition . Cowen was appointed to the front bench , first as Spokesperson on Agriculture , Food and Forestry ( 1994 ) , and later as Spokesperson on Health ( 1997 ) .\nCabinet career : 1997–2008 .\nMinister for Health and Children .\nWhen Fianna Fáil returned to power following the 1997 general election , Cowen was appointed as Minister for Health and Children . He described his period there as like being in Angola because administrative landmines could detonate without warning . During his tenure , he had to deal with problems of bed shortages and overcrowding in hospitals , as well as a prolonged nurses strike in 1999 . It came as a relief to Cowen when he was moved to the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs in a cabinet reshuffle in January 2000 .\nMinister for Foreign Affairs .\nCowens tenure as Foreign Minister saw extensive negotiations continue regarding the Northern Ireland peace process and other international activities , particularly when Ireland gained a place on the United Nations Security Council . In 2003 , he was the victim of a personal attack by the leader of Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party , Ian Paisley , a former outspoken critic of Ireland and its government . In front of a crowd of party supporters and in the presence of television cameras and radio reporters , Paisley uttered a diatribe about Cowens personal appearance and also insulted his mother . In 2004 , Cowen played a key role during Irelands Presidency of the European Council and the simultaneous expansion of the European Union .\nMinister for Finance .\nFollowing the departure of Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy , upon his nomination as Irelands European Commissioner in September 2004 , Cowen was appointed as Minister for Finance . On 1 December 2004 , he announced his first budget , one that was viewed as a give-away budget in which spending was increased by 9% .\nCowens second budget in 2005 was dominated by a new childcare package , and measures to take tax-free millionaires back into the tax net from 2007 by restricting tax breaks . A readjustment of income-tax measures were designed to take 52,000 low earners out of the tax net and remove 90,000 middle earners from the higher tax band .\nCowens third budget in 2007 , in anticipation of the 2007 general election , was regarded as one of the biggest spending sprees in the history of the state . The €3.7 billion package included increases in pension and social welfare allowances , a marked green agenda , as well as a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 42% to 41% . Cowen has been criticised for alleged complacency during the economic turmoil in January 2008 .\nLeader of Fianna Fáil .\nDuring his ministerial career , Cowen was often identified in the media as the front-runner to succeed Ahern as leader of Fianna Fáil . Cowens position was strengthened when he succeeded Mary ORourke as deputy leader of the party in 2002 . In 2004 , he was appointed Minister for Finance . Following the 2007 general election , Cowen became Tánaiste ( deputy prime minister ) in a coalition between Fianna Fáil , the PDs , and the Green Party .\nOn 4 April 2008 , two days after Ahern announced his intention to resign as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil , Cowen was nominated by Brian Lenihan and Mary Coughlan to be his successor . The following day he was confirmed as the sole nominee for the position . He was acclaimed as the seventh leader of Fianna Fáil on 9 April 2008 , and assumed office upon Aherns resignation becoming effective on 6 May 2008 .\nOn 7 May 2008 , Cowen was nominated by Dáil Éireann as Taoiseach , by 88 votes to 76 , and was appointed by President of Ireland Mary McAleese .\nOn 22 January 2011 , despite winning a secret confidence motion the week before , Cowen announced he was stepping down as leader , in advance of the 2011 election , in order to put the party in the best possible position .\n12th Taoiseach ( 2008–2011 ) .\nUpon appointment , Cowen formed the 28th Government of Ireland , a coalition between Fianna Fáil , the Greens and the PDs , which initially had the support of three independent TDs . His choices of Mary Coughlan for Tánaiste and Brian Lenihan Jnr as Minister for Finance were criticised as inappropriate by The Irish Times for their distressing lack of experience .\nTreaty of Lisbon .\nThe Irish electorates rejection of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon on 12 June 2008 , was viewed by some media and political observers as a protest against Cowen and his government . The Irish Independent called the failed referendums aftermath the governments biggest political crisis in decades . Columnist Brendan OConnor called the outcome a humiliating failure for Cowen and the people who put him there . The Taoiseach himself arguably dealt a damaging blow to his own side when , on 12 May 2008 , he admitted in a radio interview that he had not read the Treaty of Lisbon in its entirety . The treaty was eventually approved by Irish voters when the successful Twenty-eighth Amendment of the constitution was approved in the second Lisbon referendum , held in October 2009 .\n2009 Budget .\nCowen delivered the Irish government budget for 2009 on 14 October 2008 , brought forward from its usual December date due to the global financial crisis . The budget , labelled the toughest in many years , included a number of controversial measures , such as a proposed income levy and the withdrawal of previously promised HPV vaccines for schoolgirls . Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of a number of military barracks near the border with Northern Ireland .\nPublic outcry arose over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the reinstatement of university fees . A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers , whilst on 22 October 2008 , at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on government buildings at Leinster House , Kildare Street , Dublin and outside the Department of the Taoiseach in Merrion Street . Some of the pensioners were even seen to cheer on the students as the protests passed each other on the streets of Dublin . Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops over what was viewed as a disproportionate level of cuts to be suffered by Protestant Secondary schools . Separately representatives of the Roman Catholic Church were assured by OKeeffe that it would continue to be able to provide religious instruction to pupils in primary schools not under the patronage of the Church .\nRebellion within the ranks of the government led to a number of defections of disenchanted coalition members . County Wicklow TD Joe Behan , resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes . He , alongside two other government deputies , later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial Dáil votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines . These defections reduced the Irish governments majority of twelve by one quarter . Finian McGrath , an Independent TD , who agreed to support the government after the 2007 election , also withdrew his support from the government . A senior political source said : The Budget was an accident waiting to happen .\nUnder the European Union stability and growth pact , EU states are required to keep their budget deficit-to-GDP ratio below a three percent limit and maintain a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent . On 31 October 2008 , the European Commission opened an excessive deficit procedure against the Government of Ireland , for allowing its budget deficit to exceed the required EU deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3 percent . The Irish deficit was expected to be 5.5 percent in 2008 , and 6.5 percent in 2009 . This response forced reversals of proposed changes in several areas , contributing to perceived weakness in his Government .\n2008 Pork crisis .\nOn 6 December 2008 , the Food Safety Authority of Ireland ordered the recall , withdrawal and destruction of all Irish pork products dating back to 1 September , due to the discovery of toxic levels of dioxin in a small percentage of the pig stock . Cowen additionally approved a five-day withdrawal of Irish pork from the market . Within days thousands of jobs were either lost or under threat at pig processing plants across the country , as processors refused to resume slaughter of pigs until they received financial compensation ; the crisis ultimately cost taxpayers approximately €180 million . Cowens government received heavy criticism for overreaction in its handling of the incident , with Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny calling the governments response as an unmitigated disaster .\nAnglo Irish Bank .\nThe heavy exposure of Anglo Irish Bank to property lending , with most of its loan book being to builders and property developers , meant that it was badly affected by the downturn in the Irish property market in 2008 . On 15 January 2009 , after attempting to salvage the Bank by injecting €1.5bn into its coffers , the Government announced that it would take steps that would enable the Bank to be taken into State ownership . The Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act , 2009 provided for the transfer of all the shares of the Bank to the Minister for Finance and was enacted under Irish law on 21 January 2009 . On the same date , the Bank was re-registered as a private limited company .\nObservers at the time commented that the government had been slow to respond to the collapse of the Bank , with the Sunday Times stating that Nationalisation was good enough for other European governments but Brian Cowens administration avoided the inevitable until its back was to the wall . Too frequently , it is seen to be reacting to events , not controlling them .\n2009 Emergency budget .\nIn a second emergency budget , delivered in April 2009 , a fiscal deficit of 10.75 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was addressed . The budgets initiatives included a doubling of the previous years income levy to 2% , 4% and 6% ; increases on the excise duties on a regular packet of cigarettes ( 25 cents ) and a litre of diesel ( 5 cents ) ; a new asset management agency established to remove bad loans from Irish banks ; the gradual elimination of early childcare supplement by 2010 , to be replaced by a subsidy towards pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds ; and no further increases in social welfare for at least two years . Cowen defended the emergency measures as necessary .\nFirst no confidence vote .\nNational and international press reactions to the budget were largely favourable , with the economics editor of the BBC reported that there were lessons for the United Kingdom to learn from this emergency procedure and the European Commission hailing the budget as a form of decisive action . However , it did little to revive the political fortunes of Cowens government . After Fianna Fáil performed badly in the elections of 5 June 2009 , losing half its European Parliament seats , Fine Gael tabled a motion of no confidence against Cowen on 9 June . He survived the vote by a margin of 85–79 . Support for the government continued to fall : on 3 September 2009 , an Irish Times/TNS mrbi poll , opinion poll reported that Cowens satisfaction rating had dropped six points to 15 percent , with 77 percent of voters saying they were dissatisfied with the way he was doing his job .\n2010 Budget and NAMA controversy .\nCowens governments third budget within 14 months , delivered on 9 December 2009 , saw the government facing the reality of the country nearly becoming insolvent .\nIn February 2010 , Cowen defended his claim that the National Asset Management Agency ( NAMA ) would increase the supply of credit into the economy despite the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , saying it would not lead to any significant increase . People should contemplate what level of credit accessibility wed have in this economy without NAMA , he said .\nIts not just sufficient in itself obviously for credit flow , its certainly an important and necessary part of restructuring our banking system , of that theres no doubt , in terms of improving as a location for funding of banking operations , said Cowen . He previously said that the Governments objective in restructuring the banks through NAMA was to generate more access to credit for Irish business at this critical time . In September 2009 , the Minister for Finance , Brian Lenihan , expressed a similar view , saying it would lead to more lending for business and households . Cowen was responding to reports published on 8 February , that the IMF had told Brian Lenihan in April 2009 , that the NAMA would not lead to a significant increase in lending by the banks .\nThe comments , which appear in internal Department of Finance documents released under the Freedom of Information Act , were made by senior IMF official , Steven Seelig , who was to join the board of NAMA in May 2010 . Minutes of a private meeting at the department between Brian Lenihan and IMF officials on 29 April 2009 , state that the IMF ( Mr . Seelig ) do not believe that Nama will result in significant increase in bank lending in Ireland . The Government has maintained that NAMAs purchase of bad loans from the banks with State bonds would increase the flow of credit in the economy since the plan was unveiled April 2009 . Speaking at the publication of the NAMA legislation in September 2009 , Mr . Lenihan said it would strengthen and improve the funding positions of the banks so that they can lend to viable businesses and households . The IMF estimated in their published report that domestic banks would face losses of up to €35 billion , though the department pointed out this would be partly funded from operating profits and provisions already taken against some loan losses .\nSecond no confidence vote .\nSpeaking on RTÉ on 15 May 2010 , Cowen said that , in hindsight , he should have introduced a property tax to cool the property boom . Responding to the Taoiseachs defence of his actions as minister for finance , Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny accused him of washing his hands of his role in Irelands economic crisis . Speaking during a front bench meeting in Cork , Kenny also claimed Fianna Fáil was spreading fear by considering cuts to the old age pension . Sorry is a word that Fianna Fáil do not recognise , they dont understand , Kenny told party colleagues . Kenny said Taoiseach Cowen , in defending his own personal handling of events , was refusing to acknowledge that he drove the economy up on the rocks for four years when he was Minister for Finance . He expects everybody else to accept responsibility for it but not him . Its another example of hands being washed by those in charge , a refusal to accept responsibility for their part in destroying the Irish economy and heaping economic woes . . . upon so many people . The Fine Gael leader said the best thing the Taoiseach could do was to hold the three pending by-elections , or a general election , so the people could have their say .\nOn 15 June 2010 , Cowen faced his second no-confidence motion in just over a year , tabled by Fine Gael after the publication of two reports that criticised government policies in the run-up to Irelands banking crisis . He again survived the motion , 82-77 .\nEU and IMF rescue .\nOn the evening of 21 November 2010 , Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Unions European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , after long resisting pressure from other eurozone nations , particularly France and Germany.<ref 21/11></ref> On 28 November 2010 , the European Commission agreed to an €85 billion rescue deal of which €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Mechanism ( EFSM ) , €22.5 billion from the IMF , €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) and bilateral loans from the United Kingdom , Denmark and Sweden . The remaining €17.5 billion will come from a state contribution from the National Pension Reserve Fund ( NPRF ) and other domestic cash resources .\nThe bailout was widely seen in Ireland as a national humiliation , a betrayal of the long-fought struggle for Irish independence whose legacy forms a major part of the Irish identity . The Irish Times asked\nOn 24 November 2010 , Cowen unveiled a four-year plan to stabilise the economy by 2014 . The plan was met with great protest as it included deeply unpopular elements , including drastic cuts in social welfare , the lowering of the minimum wage , and an increase in the value added tax while maintaining the states low corporate tax rate . In recognition of the political disaster this would inflict on his government , Cowen indicated that the election would take place in early 2011 , after the 2011 budgetary process has been completed , though at the time he would not set a specific date .\nFall from power .\nMeeting with Seán FitzPatrick .\nIt was revealed following the publication of the book , The Fitzpatrick Tapes by Tom Lyons and Brian Carey , that two previously undisclosed meetings had occurred between Seán FitzPatrick , the Chairman of Anglo Irish Bank , and Brian Cowen .\nThe first was a telephone call in March 2008 , while Cowen was overseas in Vietnam and when Cowen was then Minister of Finance . The second meeting took place on 28 July 2008 , at Druids Glen , County Wicklow .\nAt that time Anglo Irish Bank was badly affected by the downturn in the property market . On 28 September 2008 , the Irish government made the decision to introduce a bank guarantee to cover Anglo Irish Bank , Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland . Seán FitzPatrick was forced to resign in January 2009 , over the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy . The meeting , over a seven-hour period , took place over a round of golf and a subsequent dinner with Fitzpatrick and two other directors of Anglo Irish Bank .\nDuring a heated Leaders Question session in Dáil Éireann , which ran over the allotted time considerably , Cowen denied that Anglo Irish Bank had been discussed . However , when questioned by the Sinn Féin Dáil leader Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin ( who had been attending a wedding at the hotel and by chance had encountered Cowen and Fitzpatrick ) , Cowen was forced to admit that there were two other people at the meeting , Gary McGann , a director of Anglo Irish Bank and Alan Gray , a director of the Central Bank and currently managing director of a consultancy company Indecon . Brian Cowen has claimed that the meeting was a social event , while Gray has stated that he was invited to provide economic advice on stimulating the economy . Tánaiste Mary Coughlan , described the purpose of the meeting as a fundraiser for Fianna Fáil .\nCowen has subsequently threatened to sue Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin , if he repeated the accusation outside the Dáil . Ó Caoláin responded by repeating the accusation in public and inviting Cowen to take him to court .\nJanuary cabinet reshuffle .\nIn the stir created by the revelations of Cowens meetings with Fitzpatrick , Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore , announced his plan to table a third motion of no confidence in Cowens government . At the time , however , Cowens more immediate concern was pressure from within his own party to step down as leader of Fianna Fáil . Cowen announced on 16 January 2011 , that he would not resign as party leader of his own accord ; however , he would put down a motion of confidence in his leadership at Fianna Fáils parliamentary party meeting on 18 January 2011 , to be decided by secret ballot . Foreign Minister Micheál Martin , publicly announced that he would vote against the motion , effectively presenting himself as a challenger to Cowens leadership . On the evening of 18 January 2011 , Government Chief Whip John Curran , announced that Cowen had prevailed in the confidence vote , although the exact counts were to remain secret and the ballots had been shredded . Cowen also announced that he had reluctantly accepted Martins resignation from his government .\nThe following day , however , Cowen forced the resignations of four more Ministers , Noel Dempsey , Dermot Ahern , Tony Killeen and Mary Harney ; the day after that , another Minister , Batt OKeefe , resigned . The Ministers who resigned had already declined to contest the 2011 general election . The resignations were engineered to allow Cowen to appoint new Ministers , who might strengthen his partys position for the election . However , the junior coalition partner , the Green Party , expressed outrage that they had not been consulted about the reshuffle . The Greens accordingly refused to endorse Cowens intended replacements , forcing Cowen to reassign the vacant portfolios to incumbent Ministers . The Green Party also threatened to pull out of the government unless Cowen set a firm date for the general election ; Cowen subsequently announced it would take place on 11 March 2011 . When Cowen addressed the Dáil to announce the reshuffle , the Green Party were absent and had not taken their seats in the Dáil that day . The Independent later concluded that the failed reshuffle left Cowen an isolated , hugely damaged figure .\nMoreover , Green Party leader John Gormley publicly stated that trust between the coalition parties had been greatly eroded , perhaps irreparably . At that point , members of Fianna Fáil , including many of those who had previously announced support for Cowen in the partys confidence motion , began questioning his leadership and pressing for his resignation from the leadership of the party before the election . The press , meanwhile , compared the attempted reshuffle and its fallout to the GUBU political disaster of the early 1980s Charles Haughey government , up to that point the most sensational political scandal in the history of Ireland . Fianna Fáil , already at a record low 14% approval rating , slid in the wake of the botched reshuffle to 8% .\nResignation as leader .\nFaced with a fractured coalition , rebellion within his own party , and an acknowledged public relations disaster , Cowen announced his resignation as leader of Fianna Fáil on 22 January 2011 . He insisted , however , that he would continue as Taoiseach , until the election , in order to complete legislation for the 2011 budget .\nThe resignation did not quell the consequences of Cowens actions . Labour leader Eamon Gilmore announced that he would go forward with his no-confidence motion on Wednesday , 26 January 2011 . Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny also announced that if Cowen did not ask President Mary McAleese for an immediate dissolution of the Dáil , his own party would table a no-confidence motion in the Taoiseach on Tuesday , ahead of Labours motion . Then , on Sunday the 23rd , less than 24 hours after Cowen announced his resignation , the Greens tore up the coalition agreement and pulled its two ministers , Gormley and Eamon Ryan , from the government . Cowen accepted their resignations . This left Cowen at the head of a minority government , with seven Ministers ( the absolute minimum mandated by the constitution of Ireland ) , and facing two consecutive no-confidence votes in the Dáil .\nFinance Bill , dissolution and retirement .\nOn 24 January 2011 , Finance Minister Brian Lenihan met with delegations from Fine Gael , Labour , and the Greens , striking a final deal . Labour and Fine Gael agreed to drop their no-confidence motions in exchange for an agreement that the finance bill would be finalised in the Dáil by Friday the 28th ( with the Seanad to finalise on Saturday ) , upon which Cowen would immediately request that President McAleese dissolve the Dáil .\nThe Dáil passed the finance bill on 27 January 2011 , with the Seanad following on 29 January . Accordingly , Cowen asked McAleese to dissolve the Dáil on 1 February 2011 . In accordance with Irish constitutional practice , McAleese duly granted the dissolution . Cowen subsequently confirmed that the general election would be brought forward to 25 February 2011 . Cowen also announced that he would not contest his Dáil seat . He said he would retire from politics , after 27 years .\nThe pent-up resentment at Cowens government resulted in a debacle for Fianna Fáil at the general election . The party suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state , falling to only 20 seats for third place—the first time since 1927 that it was not the largest party in the chamber . Cowen was succeeded by Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny as Taoiseach , leading a Fine Gael-Labour coalition , which took office on 9 March 2011 . As Cowen was no longer a TD when the new Dáil convened , he was unable to preside over the opening , and Fianna Fáil Leader Micheál Martin and outgoing Finance Minister Brian Lenihan appeared on the government front bench in his place .\nPublic image .\nCowen was often referred to in Irish satirical and tabloid media as BIFFO , a nickname applied to people from Offaly . BIFFO is an acronym for Big Ignorant Fecker/Fucker From Offaly . Cowen has said that BIFFO stands for Beautiful Intelligent Fellow From Offaly . An unnamed journalist described Cowen as subtle as a JCB .\nWikiLeaks cables from Ireland to the US revealed , that US diplomats in Ireland reported that the nickname BIFFO applied especially well to former Taoiseach Brian Cowen , as described in leaked US embassy dispatches .\nIn a candid profile from WikiLeaks , of Cowen as the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader , then US Ambassador Thomas Foley described Cowen as burly and brusque saying that he had a reputation of not being much concerned with his public image .\nThe Ambassador also described Mr Cowens fondness for frequenting pubs and singing , saying he would likely be more approachable than his predecessor Bertie Ahern .\nCowen was accused of conduct unbecoming , over comments he made in the Dáil when , at the end of a heated exchange , he sat down and spoke to Tánaiste Mary Coughlan ; Dáil microphones picked up the Taoiseach using the word fuckers , though he was not referring to any opposition politician . He later apologised for his remark .\nCowen has been openly criticised by his parliamentary party colleagues including one who said in an interview that Cowen has suffered from poor communications and consultation and expressed concern about the emergence of a perceived triumvirate ( comprising the Taoiseach , Tánaiste and Minister for Finance ) within the Cabinet .\nIn a novel criticism , artist and teacher Conor Casby placed unflattering nude portraits of Cowen in the National Gallery of Ireland and the gallery of the Royal Hibernian Academy . The pictures were reported in a television news bulletin and caused considerable debate in the media .\nCowen was criticised as being inept during the approach to the third budget , in December 2009 . He said , our priority is to stabilise the public finances , a year after the Irish public was told that this was the priority for 2008 .\nMorning Ireland interview .\nOn 14 September 2010 , after an interview on RTÉs Morning Ireland , Cowen was described by Deputy Simon Coveney of Fine Gael as sounding as if he was intoxicated or hungover . The interview was on the morning of day two of his partys annual pre-Dáil meeting held at the Ardilaun Hotel in Galway . Cowen rejected the allegations , describing them as pathetic . However , this incident has been unfavourably commented upon by the international press , and dubbed Garglegate by the domestic media . A brief sketch about Cowen that appeared on a subsequent episode of the American talk show The Tonight Show With Jay Leno , in which host Jay Leno described Cowen as a drunken moron and acted with incredulity towards his status as Taoiseach , received coverage in the Irish media and further damaged Cowens public image .\nHe apologised for his interview performance the following day saying , It wasnt my best performance and I would like to apologise for that . I would hate to think the reputation of the country or the office of Taoiseach would in any way be affected by what I had to say . He claimed that there was a hoarseness in his voice and denied that he had been hungover . His version of this event was substantiated in 2017 , by his interviewer who stated that Cowen was weary and not drunk or hungover .\nApproval ratings .\nAlthough Cowens satisfaction rating had sunk to 18% in Ireland , by August 2010 , he was listed as one of the top ten leaders in the world by Newsweek magazine , which praised his handling of the Irish economy . While The Wall Street Journal stated that Cowen has presided over the worst economic crisis in modern times , Newsweek ranked him fifth in the world after David Cameron , Mohamed Nasheed , Nicolas Sarkozy , and Wen Jiabao .\nAccording to TheJournal.ie , Cowen was the least popular incumbent in the history of [ Irish ] opinion polling , with approval between 8 and 10 percent of the electorate . As of January 2011 , Fianna Fáils popularity had fallen to a record low and was tied with Sinn Féin on 14% in joint third place .\nLegacy and later life .\nCowen became leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach without ever facing an election in either capacity ; he is the only Fianna Fáil leader to have left the post without ever taking the party into an election . Under his stewardship of the country , his party Fianna Fáil , saw its electoral support base diminished by 75% in the general election of February 2011 , as a reaction to the intervention , in the running of the Irish economy , of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in November 2010 .\nCowen was criticised for being a poor communicator and for his perceived failure to connect with the electorate . Historian Diarmaid Ferriter described Cowens appalling communication skills and self-destructive stubbornness as inflicting most damage to Fianna Fáil .\nAs the scale of the partys electoral defeat became evident , Cowen accepted responsibility for decisions taken in government .\nFrom my point of view as Taoiseach and as a Minister in the past I take full responsibility . Ive never quibbled or suggested otherwise .\nIn November 2011 , a review of Cowens governance was broadcast on RTÉ television over two episodes entitled Crisis : Inside the Cowen Government . Cowen did not contribute to the series , but many of his former ministerial colleagues critiqued his performance as Taoiseach .\nOn 21 March 2012 , Cowen delivered a speech at the BMW Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University , Washington , D.C. , entitled The Euro : From Crisis to Resolution ? Some Reflections from Ireland on the Road Thus Far . In his first public comments since leaving office , he defended his governments blanket bank guarantee in 2008 , but admitted that his government should have increased taxes and cut spending . He also admitted that his government should accept some blame for Irelands economic downfall . He compared the start of the 2008 economic crisis to a series of plane crashes , all taking place at the same time and each for different reasons . He receives annual pension payments of over €150,000 .\nIn May 2014 , Cowen became part of the board of Topaz Energy . He was appointed to the board of Beacon Hospital in February 2015 .\nIn April 2015 , Cowen was attacked by protesters in Dublin , in which he was called a scumbag and a traitor .\nIn July 2017 , Cowen was conferred with an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland , an honour bestowed on all but two former Taoisigh . During his 50-minute acceptance speech he criticised the EU for its behaviour towards Ireland during the financial crisis and expressed regret that so many jobs were lost during the recession . Following the conferring ceremony , the NUI faced considerable public criticism for deciding to make the award to Cowen . Former ( and founding ) President of the University of Limerick , Ed Walsh , announced that he would hand back his own honorary doctorate in protest , and did so on 14 November 2018 .\nOn 5 July 2019 , Cowen was admitted to Beacon Hospital after suffering a major brain hemorrhage . He was then transferred to St . Vincents University Hospital where he spent five months before transferring to a physical rehabilitation facility . As of February 2020 , while Cowen is still in hospital following a stroke last year , he has been making steady progress .",

    "story": "Hakan Yakin\nHakan Yakin ( ; born 22 February 1977 ) is a Swiss former footballer who played as a forward or midfielder . He was a member of the Swiss national team for eleven years .\nEarly and personal life .\nYakin was born in Basel , Switzerland , to Turkish parents . He grew up and went to school in suburban Münchenstein , Basel-Landschaft , just outside Basel , and close to the borders of France and Germany . He is the younger brother of international football player Murat Yakin , also a former member of the Swiss national football team , who currently works as a manager . His elder half-brother Ertan Irizik is also a former football professional . Yakins surname is based on the Turkish word Yakın ( meaning close , adjacent ) , however as he is a Swiss resident and citizen , the name which he uses is Yakin .\nClub career .\nAs a child Yakin played in the youth teams of his local side FC Concordia Basel . He signed his first professional contract with hometown club FC Basel in January 1995 . He played his League debut for Basel on 12 April 1995 in the 1994–95 season in the match against Lausanne Sports . He was brought on in the 60th minute as replacement for Alexandre Rey and with his first touch of the ball , just 18 seconds later , he scored the goal to make it 3–0 , a header ( final score 5–0 ) .\nAfter two and a half years in Basel he transferred to Grasshopper Club Zürich , with manager Christian Gross , but could not establish himself , making most of his appearances as substitute , and he was loaned to FC St . Gallen for the second half of the 1997–98 season . He moved immediately into the starting eleven and so the loan was prolonged , before he returned to the Grasshoppers .\nDuring January 2001 he transferred back to Basel . At the end of the 2001–02 season Yakin won the national Double with Basel and a year later won the Swiss Cup again . He recalls the 2002–03 Champions League Group B match on 12 November 2002 against Liverpool in St . Jakob-Park as the match of his life . The game was drawn 3–3 and Yakin gave all three assists as Basel cruised to a 3–0 half-time lead as they qualified , one point above Liverpool , for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League second group stage .\nCuriosity during the championship play-off round of their 2002–03 season was , that in the home match in the St . Jakob-Park on 19 April 2003 , Yakin had a good game and scored a perfect hat-trick during the first half of the game as Basel won 3–0 against Young Boys.<ref championship></ref> Yakin showed his other side in the return match in the Stadion Neufeld in Bern one week later . As YB went a goal up he lost his temper and kicked the ball away , thus collecting a yellow card . Just ten minutes later a committed a rough foul and collecting a second yellow , thus yellow/red , to be sent-off.<ref championship></ref>\nHis career was then overshadowed by some trouble regarding his club transfers , as his engagements outside Switzerland ( Paris Saint-Germain , VfB Stuttgart , and Galatasaray ) were not accompanied by luck . In 2005–06 , Yakin returned to Switzerland , joining BSC Young Boys . In July 2008 , Yakin signed a contract with Qatar champions Al-Gharafa , for a salary of around €2.5 million per year .\nIn March 2009 , it was reported that Yakin had been training with the Grasshopper Club Zürich Under-21 side , coached by his brother Murat , in a bid to get fit . Yakin then signed a contract on 25 June 2009 in his homeland Switzerland with FC Luzern , running through to 30 June 2011 . In summer 2011 his brother Murat became his manager at FC Luzern .\nDuring the mid-season break in January 2012 Yakin transferred to AC Bellinzona in the Challenge League , the second tier of Swiss football . He played his team debut on 26 February in the 2–0 home win against Stade Nyonnais . He scored his first two goals for the club in the 3–2 away win against Aarau on 9 April 2012 .\nInternational career .\nYakin was capped 87 times for Switzerland , the first coming in 2000 . He was offered Turkish nationality before being called up to the Swiss squad , but turned it down for personal reasons . He has played in UEFA Euro 2004 , UEFA Euro 2008 , and both the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup with his country .\nOn 11 June 2008 , he scored the opening goal in the 32nd minute of Switzerlands second Euro 2008 Group A match against Turkey , giving them a 1–0 lead and he refused to celebrate after the goal as a respect for his familys birth country . However , he missed another chance shortly afterward as Turkey scored two second-half goals , resulting in Switzerlands becoming the first team to be mathematically eliminated from their own tournament within five days of its beginning . However , in Switzerlands final group match against Portugal on 15 June , Yakin added two second-half goals , the second a penalty kick , to secure their first ever win at the UEFA European Championship , 2–0 . Yakin finished the tournament as joint-second highest goalscorer with Lukas Podolski , Roman Pavlyuchenko , and Semih Şentürk with three goals each , behind David Villas four goals .\nUnder new national team coach , Ottmar Hitzfeld , Yakin participated in seven of Switzerlands ten qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , starting twice , and making five substitute appearances , scoring one goal in Switzerlands opening qualifier against Israel . He announced his retirement from the Swiss national team on 4 October 2011 .\nHonours .\nClub .\nGrasshoppers\n- Swiss Super League : 2000–01\nBasel\n- Swiss Super League : 2001–02\n- Swiss Cup : 2001–02 , 2002–03\n- Uhrencup : 2003\nGalatasaray\n- Turkish Cup : 2004–05\nYoung Boys\n- Uhrencup : 2007\nIndividual .\n- Axpo Swiss Super League Player of the Year : 2003 , 2008\n- Swiss Super League top scorer : 2007–08 ( 24 goals )\nNotes and references .\n- References :\nExternal links .\n- Profile at Swiss Football League Website\n- Official Yakin brothers website\n- 123 Football profile",

    "story": "Affari tuoi\nAffari tuoi ( ; ) is an Italian game show based upon the internationally popular game show Deal or No Deal . It aired on Rai 1 from 13 October 2003 to 17 March 2017 in the access prime time range . From 26 December 2020 , the program returned to air on Saturday between the access prime time slot and the prime time slot . It is broadcast on public broadcaster Rai 1 , and it is also shown regularly on RAI International , RAIs international television service .\nThe show was hosted in chronological order include : Paolo Bonolis ( October 2003 – May 2005 ) , Pupo ( September 2005 – March 2006 ) , Antonella Clerici ( March – June 2006 ) , Flavio Insinna ( September 2006 – June 2008 ) , Max Giusti ( September 2008 – June 2013 ) and again Flavio Insinna ( September 2013 - 17 March 2017 ) . The re-edition of 2020 sees the conduct of Carlo Conti , who had already conducted the episode of 1 April 2015 , exchanging the management of Leredità , a program that he presented at that time , with Flavio Insinna , to make an April fool to viewers .\nGameplay .\nIn this Italian version , there are 20 boxes ; each person holding a box lives in and represents of one of the twenty regions of Italy .\nThe highest prize is €500,000 , but on some occasions there is a special €1,000,000 prize . In addition to small money prizes , like €0.50 , there are three gag prizes—usually items like salami , a years supply of soap , or stuffed animals like hippos and weasels ( from seasons 2006 to 2007 , a hippo prize took place instead of the €500 one ) .\nThe box named Pacco X , and also a Pacco Y between September 2008 and June 2013 ( both meaning mystery package ) , may contain values between €0.02 and €200,000 ( see below ) .\nThe box named Pacco Matto ( crazy box , February 2011 – June 2013 ) or La Matta ( the madwoman , from September 2013 onwards ) may contain one of the possibilities that may affect the progress of the game , positively or negatively , including doubling the top prize to €1,000,000 , or forcing the player to leave the game ( see below ) .\nThe manager is known as Il Dottore ( the doctor ) and knows the content of the boxes . Therefore , sometimes his offers can give hints as to whether the contestants box contains a high amount of money .\nIn order to give himself further chances , the manager sometimes decides to play Di pacco in pacco ( step by step ) when high prizes are still active .\nIn Affari tuoi , to refuse an offer , instead of saying No Deal! , a contestant says , Rifiuto lofferta e vado avanti , meaning I refuse the offer and go on . To accept , a contestant says Accetto lofferta , meaning , Ill take the offer . Unlike the US version of the show , there is no button to push . ( In fact , international versions of Deal do not use a button and cover. )\nComparison with other versions .\n- The Spanish version of Deal or no Deal , ¡Allá tú! , aired by Mediasets Telecinco is exactly the same format as the Italian version , except that the boxes represent 20 of the 50 provinces of Spain .\n- The British version uses boxes like the Italian one . The syndicated US version uses 22 like the British version , but uses briefcases like the primetime NBC version , and is somewhat different in format .\n- The French version , À prendre ou à laisser , is different in format , but uses a box for each region concept .\nTop prize winners .\nThe first winner of €1 million occurred on April 7 , 2006 , when Maria Giulia Tullo from Fossalto won €1,000,000 . Just ten days later , Vincenzo de Paola from Campobasso won €500,000 . They also received the Tapiro dOro ( Golden Tapir ) from the Canale 5 show Striscia la notizia , due to suspected fraud .\nOn March 17 , 2012 , another million euro winning occurred to Gabriele Calvello , thanks to picking Raddoppia which doubles the top prize after opening Pacco Matto . Calvello , whose father died of cancer , decided to donate part of his winnings for cancer research .\nIn addition , thirteen players won €500,000 in their boxes :\n- Roberto Pepi ( February 4 , 2004 )\n- Francesca Madeddu ( December 16 , 2004 )\n- Clarissa Meneghini ( December 19 , 2007 )\n- Danilo Anderlini ( September 17 , 2008 )\n- Francesca Cataldo ( October 22 , 2008 )\n- Roberto Caterina ( November 23 , 2008 )\n- Mara Ancelotti ( January 1 , 2009 )\n- Stefania Menegazzo ( February 22 , 2010 )\n- Mauro Ghiraldini ( November 21 , 2012 )\n- Patrizia Montalbano ( January 25 , 2013 )\n- Pierangela Zaccaria ( May 29 , 2014 )\n- Alberto Bindi ( May 17 , 2016 )\n- Alessandro Corona ( February 22 , 2017 )\nOn March 16 , 2013 , Cristiana Fraccon from Carugate accepted the offer of €500,000 , which is the biggest offer in the shows history , with €50 and the doubled top prize of €1,000,000 remaining . She had the latter in her box .\nControversy .\nIn the Fall of 2006 , Codacons , an Italian consumers organisation , pointed out how high prize boxes ( pacchi ) seemed to survive up to the end of the game in much more cases than would be statistically expected .\nBox values ( as of September 2016 to March 2017 ) .\nNote : Some small values will be replaced with joke prizes .\nPossible values of Pacco X ( as of September 2013 to June 2015 ) .\nPacco X ( and also Pacco Y from September 2008 to June 2013 ) are unknown content boxes ( the mystery packages ) . At a certain point of the game , the contestant is asked to take one of the ten envelopes ( two of twenty until June 2013 ) contained into a poll and containing a prize from €0.02 to €200,000 . Since September 2015 there is no Pacco X content boxes .\nBrivido .\nPreviously known as Pacco Matto ( crazy box ) until June 2013 , and La Matta ( the madwoman ) until June 2014 and Sgambetto ( trip ) until June 2016 . If the player has not sold his/her box yet and there are more than two unopened boxes , once Brivido ( shiver ) is opened , the player is asked to take one of six cards containing each of the following :\n- Cambio obbligato ( Forced swap ) : The player is forced to swap his/her box with one of other unopened boxes .\n- Niente special ( Nothing special ) : Special ( see below ) is no longer effective when the player reveals 3 blues in a row .\n- Pari o dispari ?

( Swap with two? ) : The player can either keep his/her box , or swap it with two of the other boxes .\n- Paccologia ( Parcelology ) : A screenshot from a past episode of the show with several remaining amounts is shown , and the player is asked to guess which was won . The doctor reveals one of the boxes containing a blue amount if the player guessed correctly .\nBrivido has a value of €200 if it is held by the player .\nThe following were once appeared but were later replaced :\n- Raddoppia ( Double ) : The biggest unrevealed amount is doubled ( except for Pacco X and Pacco Y ) .\n- Apri un blu ( Open a blue ) : The doctor tells the player the number of a box containing a blue amount ( from €0.01 to €250 , except for Pacco X and Pacco Y ) .

The player wins an extra €1,000 for correct guess .\n- Ci penso io ( Ill take care of it ) : The player will temporarily leave the place , and was replaced in the choice of the next 3 boxes with the box holder who opened the scroll .

    "story": "Maplelawn\nMaplelawn is an historic house and former estate located in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada . The house was built between 1831 and 1834 as the centre of a farming estate by the Thomson family . In 1877 the Cole family bought the estate and lived there until 1989 . The house is now owned by the National Capital Commission and it is a designated national historic site . It is particularly noted for the well preserved and rare walled garden next to the house , The Maplelawn Garden . Since 1999 the Maplelawn has been the location of the Keg Manor restaurant . Today the house is located in Westboro at 529 Richmond Road .\nThe architecture of the house reflects a taste for British classicism , but some elements , such as the windows , are in a more local style , favoured in Quebec and the Ottawa Valley . The walled garden is a very rare feature for a Canadian farming estate . Although highly prized in Europe , they were never widespread in Canada . It was intended to be both ornamental and useful .\nHistory .\nAround 1818 William Thomson , a gentleman of Scottish origin , retired from the British army and settled the farm on the road leading from Bytown to the village of Richmond . Thomson and his sons focused on the farming operations of their estate , but also invested peripherally in the lumber trade .\nIn 1877 the Thomsons sold the farm to the Thomas Cole , who had made a fortune in the lumber industry . The Cole family and their descendants retained possession of the house until the death of Frances Rochester , the granddaughter of Thomas Cole in 1989 . Frances and her husband , Lloyd Rochester , lived at Maplelawn and raised their children there ( the Rochesters were another old Ottawa family ) . The most important renovation was conducted in 1936 , when the original summer kitchen and field hands dormitory was replaced by a stone addition to the house at the rear . At this same time the garden was redesigned by a horticulturalist from the Central Experimental Farm . The Federal District Commission , forerunner of the NCC , had bought the house in the 1950s to ensure its preservation .\nThe property was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1989 .\nFor some years the house remained empty and the garden began to deteriorate , but in 1993 , the Friends of Maplelawn Garden , a volunteer group , began to work on the garden . The NCC renovated the building . Shortly thereafter , Peter Fallis leased the property and conducted a massive renovation ; both internally and externally . Mr Fallis invested greatly in transforming the interior of the building from a single-family residence with servants quarters , into a beautiful restaurant .\nThis new restaurant converted the 1933 addition at the back of the building into a bar and sitting ( waiting ) area for guests . The bar had an impressive bar wood and a large fireplace that welcomed visitors to warm themselves in the winter and housed bouquets constructed from donations from the walled garden ( The Friends of Maplelawn ) in the warmer months . The western side of the addition housed French doors that led to a large flagstone patio and outdoor reception area . The patios and reception areas were extensively renovated by a landscape architect who , with the help of their team , did an outstanding job .\nIn the front of the house , on the main floor , there were two dining rooms , both with fireplaces , that shared an elegant design that ran throughout the remainder of the house . All of the dining rooms had some two-person tables and those that could convert from square four-person tables to six-person round tables ; this was quite a unique design at the time . All of the tables had Chippendale chairs ( a variety were purchased both with and without arms and all with beautiful fabric seats ) .\nThere is an impressive main entrance at the front of the house , but it was not used during the operation of the restaurant . The main entrance was situated to the rear of the building off of the newly constructed parking lot . There were sparkling beautiful chandeliers in each room and in the hallways as well . In addition , a local artisan produced wall sconces that provided additional lighting to all of the dining rooms on both levels of the restaurant . All of the rooms in the house had deep-set ( due to the thick stone walls ) , casement windows . They were ( and still are ) outstanding and their sills offered great locations for floral arrangements and candlelight in all of the dining areas and the bar . In order to access the upper dining areas , there was a main , curving staircase . This staircase had an amazing , ornate mural ( painted by Peter Langlois and Dana Wardrop http://www.applieddesigns.ca/about.htm ) painted on the curved wall that led visitors to the equally stunning second storey .\nThe second level housed two dining rooms ( one large and one small ) as well as a unique , one-person washroom . This bathroom also had murals painted on its walls , but the focal point of the room was the original bathtub that was being used as a planter . There were several tropical and flowering plants in the bathtub ( which was filled with earth ) to the point where being in this washroom made you feel as if you were in a garden oasis ; somewhat of an homage to the walled Victorian garden .\nAlso unique to this restaurant , is that the kitchen was created on the second level of the house . The kitchen was fantastic to work in as it had rows of windows that allowed sunlight to fill the kitchen making for a very cheery work environment . Initially , the hope was to send the food down to the main level on an automated dumbwaiter that landed in the bar area . Unfortunately , this idea proved to be less efficient than was expected and the device that was designed and built at great cost was never used for this purpose . The restaurant reverted to using person-power to run the food down the stairs on large oval trays .\nUnfortunately , the Maplelawn Cafe did not survive long enough to allow it to become the outstanding restaurant it should have been . Instead , several setbacks ( including the 1998 ice storm that affected all of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec ) , forced the restaurant into bankruptcy . The NCC benefitted greatly from the leasehold improvements made to the house by Peter Fallis . The conversion of the property from a residence to a restaurant allowed them to lease it to another restaurant that needed to do very little in the way of improvements . In the late 1990s a couple of different businessmen took over the lease and created a franchise of The Keg restaurant , to be called the Keg Manor in the house .",

    "story": "Jake Sedgemore\nJacob Oliver Jake Sedgemore ( born 20 October 1978 in Wolverhampton ) is an English footballer who plays for AFC Wulfrunians . He previously played in the Football League for Shrewsbury Town and Bury . His brother Ben was also a professional footballer .\nFootball career .\nSedgemore began his footballing career at home in the Midlands with West Bromwich Albion , whom he joined as a trainee in August 1997 . In December of that year , he spent a short loan spell with non-league side Hednesford Town . After impressing , the deal was made permanent in October 1998 .\nRenowned for his footballing versatility , he actually spent part of his career with the club playing as a goalkeeper , a far cry from his preferred and arguably specialized position of midfield . He spent just under three years with Hednesford , making around 40 appearances before leaving at the end of the 2000-01 season when they were relegated . He signed briefly for Hereford United making only two appearances in a defensive role , before moving on to join Northwich Victoria early in the season .\nHe played more than 60 matches at Victoria , before joining Shrewsbury Town in July 2003 , and was part of the team that won promotion from the Conference back to the Football League in the 2003–04 season . After making 70 appearances for the Shropshire club , he was released in the summer of 2005 . Despite interest from a number of clubs , he opted to join Bury , where he spent a rather unsuccessful six months .\nOn the flipside , during that time Sedgemore was loaned out to Football Conference club Burton Albion , and whilst there he played a full part in both of the clubs memorable FA Cup matches against Manchester United in January 2006 .\nAfter sealing his release from Bury later that month , Sedgemore opted against a one-year contract with Burton Albion in favour of a two-year deal with Kidderminster Harriers .\nHe made his debut for them in early February 2006 against Halifax Town , but failed to sustain a regular first team place and left at the end of the 2006–07 season .\nSedgemore signed for Conference side Altrincham at the start of July 2007 . However it was a season of disappointment for him and he was released at the end of the season . He then joined Conference North club Solihull Moors , before switching to Nantwich Town in 2009 .\nIn 2011 , Sedgemore signed for Chasetown , before a move to AFC Wulfrunians , where he captained the club to their second West Midlands Regional League Premier Division title in 2013 .\nSedgemores brother , Ben , played football for several clubs including Kings Lynn . Despite both the pair being professional footballers for a number of years , injuries and suspensions always prevented the two from playing against one another .",

    "story": "Ernest Faber\nErnest Anthonius Jacobus Faber ( born 27 August 1971 ) is a Dutch professional football manager and former player . He was most recently head coach of caretaker manager of Eredivisie side PSV Eindhoven .\nFaber grew up in Eindhoven and played youth football at local club DBS until he joined PSV Eindhoven aged 13 . Besides loan spells at NEC , Sparta and Groningen , Faber was part of PSV for 12 seasons and won four Eredivisie titles , a KNVB Cup and four Johan Cruyff Shields . He also played one match for the Netherlands national team in 1998 . Injuries plagued Faber throughout his career and forced him to retire at age 32 .\nAfter his playing career , Faber worked at the PSV youth academy and at FC Eindhoven as assistant coach and manager . From 2011 until UEFA Euro 2012 , he also served as assistant manager for the Netherlands national team . From March 2012 , Faber worked as assistant manager at PSV . On 4 June 2015 , he was appointed manager of Eredivisie side NEC . Faber then moved to fellow top division club Groningen in 2016 .\nEarly career .\nBorn in Geldrop , Faber grew up in the Strijp neighbourhood in Eindhoven , which also included PSVs home ground , the Philips Stadion . At five , he started playing youth football at local amateur club DBS . Fabers performances led to interest from PSV and EVV , with PSV scout Gerrit van Tilburg having discovered him at DBS . He chose to join PSV at 13 . Fabers original position was right winger , but at PSV , he moved to the central defense position under the guidance of former defender and youth coach Huub Stevens .\nClub career .\nLoan spells and first PSV years .\nTo gain first-team experience , PSV loaned Faber out to NEC in 1990 . He made his professional debut on 25 August in a 2–1 away win against MVV . In October , Faber was sent-off during a 7–0 loss to Ajax . NECs season ended in 18th place and relegation ; Faber appeared in 30 league fixtures and three cup games . For the 1991–92 season , Faber was loaned out to Sparta . He played 32 Eredivisie matches . Sparta finished eighth in the league and also reached the semi-finals of the KNVB Cup in which Faber played five games .\nIn 1992 , Faber returned to PSV . In his debut match , he won the Dutch Super Cup after beating Feyenoord with 1–0 . Faber appeared in 18 Eredivisie matches in his first season . He played his first UEFA Champions League match as a substitute against FC Porto . Fabers debut in the starting line-up followed in the home fixture over A.C . Milan , after the PSV squad was struggling with injuries . Coach Hans Westerhof assigned him to Milans Marco van Basten , whom Faber managed to prevent from scoring .\nIn the 1993–94 season , Faber played five league games for PSV before being loaned out to Groningen for the second half of the season . At Groningen , Faber played 11 matches . After finishing third in the 1994–95 season , PSV and Faber reached the second place a year later and also won the KNVB Cup .\nInjury trouble .\nIn 1996 , Faber won his second Super Cup after defeating Ajax with 3–0 . But in September , Faber tore his ankle ligaments after attempting a headed duel with Utrecht’s John van Loen . It turned out to be the first of a long line of injuries that would dominate Faber’s career . Cartilage was removed from Faber’s ankle , sidelining him for a long period . He would play only nine Eredivisie matches in the 1996–97 season , the year that PSV won the league . In the 1997–98 season , Faber played three matches before suffering an achilles tendon injury . He recovered in time for a training camp in Spain , but it was there when he noticed the injury did not completely heal yet . That year , Faber appeared in 21 league games and scored twice . In February , he was sent off in a match against Ajax . In May , Faber tore his right Achilles tendon in a match against Groningen . The injury was called career threatening by the PSV club doctor and forced Faber to recover for months , therefore missing out on a possible World Cup participation .\nIn the 1999–2000 season , Faber suffered new injuries on his hamstring , Achilles tendon and ankle . In February , he underwent an operation on his ankle , which had to be put in a cast . PSV won the Eredivisie that year , but Faber only appeared in three league matches . In the build-up to the 2000–01 season , PSV won the Johan Cruyff Shield after beating Roda JC with 2–0 . Faber scored the second goal in the match . After the match , Faber ended up with an injured left knee . When a few weeks of rest did not solve the troubles , an operation followed in September . PSV clinched the league title again and this time Faber had a bigger contribution with 17 matches . In June 2001 , Faber extended his contract with PSV for another two years . In the following two seasons , Faber played 42 Eredivisie matches and won his fourth league title in 2003 , but was still struggling with his injuries . In the 2001–02 season , Faber received a head wound in the match against Heerenveen and suffered a minor knee injury . Newcastle United showed interest in signing him in early 2002 , but after the new injury a possible deal was cancelled .\nIn February 2003 , Faber signed a new one-year contract extension with PSV . A month later , he had to rest for a few matches to rest his hamstring . In April , Faber broke his metacarpus in a match against De Graafschap . In May 2003 , while playing with a cast due to his metacarpus injury , Faber suffered an inflammation of a bursa near his Achilles tendon . The injury required surgery and continued to provide problems in the 2003–04 season . He finally returned in the Champions League match against AS Monaco in November 2003 , but received a hamstring injury during that game . He returned in an exhibition match against Trabzonspor in January 2004 , but Faber suffered a new hamstring injury . He was sidelined for another month . On 22 April , the verdict from independent medical staff was that Faber could not continue his career . He announced his retirement , effective on that day . During his career , Faber underwent 13 surgeries for his injuries . In May , Faber was granted a fan farewell during the seasons last home game .\nInternational career .\nFaber played four matches for the Netherlands under-21 team . In February 1998 , his good performances with PSV were rewarded with a call-up by coach Guus Hiddink for the senior team trip to the United States . The Netherlands were scheduled to play exhibition matches against the United States and Mexico . After being an unused substitute in the United States match , Faber made a 58th minute appearance in the game against Mexico on 24 February 1998 . The match was played in Miami . He replaced Winston Bogarde when the Netherlands were leading 3–0 . Eventually , the game finished 3–2 , with Faber causing a penalty in favour of Mexico . Faber was one of the players considered by Hiddink to be selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup but after he injured himself before the start of the tournament , he was unable to appear .\nManagerial career .\nIn the summer of 2005 , Faber became coach of PSVs reserve team Jong PSV . In the 2005–06 season of the Beloften Eredivisie , Fabers team narrowly escaped relegation . But in September 2006 , Faber left Jong PSV . He claimed that the team was neglected by PSV and not strengthened as promised . Fabers desire was to remain at the club , but the board did not offer him another position . Faber proceeded to join FC Eindhoven as their assistant manager in December 2006 . In October 2007 , FC Eindhoven sacked their manager Louis Coolen . Faber stepped up as caretaker manager for two months . He went back to his position as assistant when Gerald Vanenburg was appointed as the new manager in December . Seeking a new challenge , Faber announced in February 2008 he would leave FC Eindhoven at the end of the season . Before his departure , Faber had to become FC Eindhovens caretaker manager again after Vanenburg resigned in April . He coached the team in the remaining three matches .\nIn 2008 , Faber returned to PSV to coach the under-19 squad . He signed a two-year contract . In November 2009 , Faber showed interest in becoming the PSV academy director . The other youth coaches favoured Faber as well , but the PSV board decided to appoint Jelle Goes . He decided to leave the club again after the 2009–10 season , even though PSV offered him the position of Jong PSV coach . In February 2010 , he passed his coaching exam , enabling him to be a manager in the Netherlands . Faber simultaneously agreed on a two-year contract as manager of MVV Maastricht . But in June , he retracted his decision after he was unsure about the clubs financial perspectives . MVV accepted Fabers decision . Faber subsequently became the manager of FC Eindhoven after signing a two-year contract . The team performed well in the Eerste Divisie , with a fifth place at the winter break period . In December , Faber was approached by VVV-Venlo to become their manager , but he rejected the offer .\nIn February 2011 , Faber was appointed as assistant manager of Bert van Marwijk at the Netherlands national team . After Faber accepted the national team job , his performances with FC Eindhoven went downhill . With four points from the following eleven matches , FC Eindhoven missed out on a play-off spot . In the 2011–12 season , the FC Eindhoven performances were again above expectations . The team were third in the Eerste Divisie at the time Faber left the club . In March 2012 , Faber returned to PSV as assistant manager after Fred Rutten was sacked as manager . Phillip Cocu was chosen as caretaker . Unlike Cocu , Fabers role was permanent after agreeing on a two-and-a-half-year contract . Faber was present at UEFA Euro 2012 when the Dutch team were knocked out in the group stage . After Van Marwijk resigned in the wake of the elimination , Faber also quit to fully focus on his job at PSV . Despite receiving several managing position offers in 2013 , Faber signed a new two-year contract and continued to work as assistant manager after the appointment of Cocu as PSV manager . After 3 seasons as PSV assistant , in which Faber briefly was interim manager due to Phillip Cocu having an emergency surgery , Faber left to manage newly promoted NEC Nijmegen , where he remained for a season and impressing many clubs by leading the nijmegen side to a top half finish in the league , and proving wrong many pundits alike who believed based on Fabers previous record with PSV in the latter stages of the 2013-14 season that he wouldnt succeed at NEC . His peformances caught the eye of FC Groningen , who appointed him manager in pre-season of the 2016-17 season . Faber remained in Groningen for 2 seasons , before being sacked due to inconsistency in results and a failure to qualify for the European play-offs .\nIn June 2018 , Faber was appointed head of academy under new manager Mark van Bommel .\nIn November 2019 , following the unexpected sacking of Mark van Bommel , Faber was appointed interim manager for the remainder of the 2019-20 season , after a decent 6 wins out of 11 , the season was nul and voided due to the global Covid-19 pandemic , meaning that PSV automatically qualified for the 2020-21 Europa League 3rd qualifying round based on League position at the time , thus classifying Fabers brief second interim spell as an almost success . Faber left PSV eindhoven in July 202 , following the appointment of Roger Schmidt as the new head coach , in a staff rebuild , Faber was also subsequently relieved off his duties as head of academy , despite being the mastermind behind the first team breakthroughs of current stars Donyell Malen and Mohammed Itaharren .\nPersonal life .\nHis son , Cas Faber , plays as a midfielder for FC Eindhoven .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\n- Eredivisie : 1996–97 , 1999–2000 , 2000–01 , 2002–03\n- KNVB Cup : 1995–96\n- Johan Cruyff Shield : 1992 , 1996 , 1998 , 2000\nExternal links .\n- Ernest Faber at PSV Eindhoven",

    "story": "Elisabeth Bik\nElisabeth Margaretha Harbers-Bik ( born 1966 ) is a Dutch microbiologist and scientific integrity consultant . Bik is known for her work detecting photo manipulation in scientific publications , and identifying over 4,000 potential cases of improper research conduct , including 400 research papers published by authors in China from a paper mill company . Bik is the founder of Microbiome Digest , a blog with daily updates on microbiome research , and the Science Integrity Digest blog .\nEarly life and education .\nBik is born in the Netherlands . She attended Utrecht University majoring in biology , and continued there for her doctorate . Her dissertation was about developing vaccines for new classes of Vibrio cholerae involved in cholera epidemics across India and Bangladesh . She conducted her doctorate and her postdoctoral studies at the molecular microbiology department in the National Institute of Health and the Environment in Bilthoven .\nCareer .\nPublic sector .\nAfter receiving her Ph.D. , Bik worked for the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and St . Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein , where she organized the development of new molecular techniques for identifying infectious agents .\nAcademia .\nIn 2001 , Bik moved to California to work at Stanford University in the laboratory of David Relman , where her work focused on human microbiomes , previously unidentified microbial species in them , and their diversity across individuals . Her work explored other mucosal microbiomes , confirming that the human oral microbiota contains distinct genera from the gut microbiota .\nWhile at Stanford , Bik worked on an Office of Naval Research project to study the microbiome of dolphins and sea lions in San Diego . She found that their microbiome was distinct from other mammals , and influenced by the sea they lived in .\nPrivate sector .\nIn 2016 , Bik left Stanford to work for uBiome , a biotech company involved in the sequencing of human microbiomes , before leaving the company in 2018 to work full-time on analyzing scientific papers for image duplication and other malpractices .\nScience integrity .\nIn 2014 , she started the blog Microbiome Digest , where she provided easy-to-understand commentaries on recent scientific papers . The blog soon became a success , and Bik enlisted help from her colleagues on Twitter to manage the content . She is also an active contributor to Retraction Watch and PubPeer , highlighting scientific papers that present falsified , duplicated , and questionable data , such as in western blot images .\nTogether with Arturo Cassadevall and Ferric Fang , Bik published an mBio paper investigating the prevalence of these questionable practices within published scientific papers , where they found nearly 400 papers with intentional figure manipulation ( i.e . about 800 duplicate images ) . She estimates half of these were created with the intention to mislead . Bik is active on the social media micro-blogging platform , Twitter , where she posts potentially duplicated figures for her more than 90,000 Twitter followers ( ) to investigate . Her investigations have exposed significant levels of scientific misconduct in several journals . In 2018 , Bik was featured on the pop science podcast Everything Hertz .\nIn 2019 , Bik announced via Twitter that she was taking a year off paid work to investigate scientific misconduct , the subject on which she coauthored a preregistered test suggesting that academic culture , peer control , cash-based publication incentives and national misconduct policies , but not pressure to publish , may affect scientific integrity , with nationality being a stronger predictor than individual attributes . Her analysis of 960 recent papers published in Molecular and Cellular Biology found that 59 ( 6.1% ) contained inappropriately duplicated images , from which 5 papers were subsequently retracted and 41 papers had corrections published , and led to a pilot image screening program at the journal identifying problems with 14.5% of subsequent submissions .\nIn February 2020 , Science reported that Bik had identified over 400 research papers published in China over the previous three years , apparently all originating from the same paper mill company providing full service production of articles describing fake research for medical students on demand . Bik said , students in China need to have a paper published to get their MD , but they do not have time to do research , so that is an unrealistic goal .\nIn March 2020 , commenting on the publication of the results of a clinical trial by Didier Raoult on the effect of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 , she identified a conflict of interest and strongly criticized the methodology of the study . The learned society that owns the journal in which the results were published admitted that the publication was not at the level expected by the society , in particular due to a lack of justification of the criteria for patient selection and triage . However , the society rebutted allegations of a conflict of interest , stating that the peer review process prior to publication was respected because Jean-Marc Rolain , being one of the co-authors of the article and editor of the journal , did not participate in the evaluation . The publisher Elsevier then announced an additional independent evaluation to determine whether the concerns about the article were well founded .\nOn May 5 , 2021 , the French association Citizen4Science made of scientists and citizens , published a press release including a link to a petition denouncing the harassment of scientists and defenders of science integrity , specifically mentioning Elisabeth Bik and calling on the French authorities to intervene and journalists to look into the matter . The included petition was signed by thousands of citizens throughout the world . On May 22 , 2021 , The Guardian reported that Raoult began legal proceedings against Bik by filing a case with the French state prosecutor . As a result , Lonni Besançon , a French postdoctoral research fellow at Monash University , Australia drafted an open letter in support of Bik and also post‑publication peer review . Within four days , the letter had attracted 500signatories and currently counts more than 1000 .\nAwards .\nIn November 2020 Bik was awarded the Peter Wildy Prize by the Microbiology Society for communication of microbiology in education and to the public .\nExternal links .\n- Microbiome Digest blog",

    "story": "Red Hat Linux\nRed Hat Linux , created by the company Red Hat , was a widely used Linux distribution until its discontinuation in 2004 .\nEarly releases of Red Hat Linux were called Red Hat Commercial Linux . Red Hat published the first non-beta release in May 1995 . It was the first Linux distribution to use the RPM Package Manager as its packaging format , and over time has served as the starting point for several other distributions , such as Mandriva Linux and Yellow Dog Linux .\nIn 2003 , Red Hat discontinued the Red Hat Linux line in favor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) for enterprise environments . Fedora , developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat , is a free-of-cost alternative intended for home use . Red Hat Linux 9 , the final release , hit its official end-of-life on April 30 , 2004 , although updates were published for it through 2006 by the Fedora Legacy project until that shut down in early 2007 .\nFeatures .\nVersion 3.0.3 was one of the first Linux distributions to support ELF ( Executable and Linkable Format ) binaries instead of the older a.out format .\nRed Hat Linux introduced a graphical installer called Anaconda developed by Ketan Bagal , intended to be easy to use for novices , and which has since been adopted by some other Linux distributions . It also introduced a built-in tool called Lokkit for configuring the firewall capabilities .\nIn version 6 Red Hat moved to glibc 2.1 , egcs-1.2 , and to the 2.2 kernel . It also introduced Kudzu , a software library for automatic discovery and configuration of hardware .\nVersion 7 was released in preparation for the 2.4 kernel , although the first release still used the stable 2.2 kernel . Glibc was updated to version 2.1.92 , which was a beta of the upcoming version 2.2 and Red Hat used a patched version of GCC from CVS that they called 2.96 . The decision to ship an unstable GCC version was due to GCC 2.95s bad performance on non-i386 platforms , especially DEC Alpha . Newer GCCs had also improved support for the C++ standard , which caused much of the existing code not to compile .\nIn particular , the use of a non-released version of GCC caused some criticism , e.g . from Linus Torvalds and the GCC Steering Committee ; Red Hat was forced to defend their decision .\nGCC 2.96 failed to compile the Linux kernel , and some other software used in Red Hat , due to stricter checks . It also had an incompatible C++ ABI with other compilers . The distribution included a previous version of GCC for compiling the kernel , called kgcc .\nAs of Red Hat Linux 7.0 , UTF-8 was enabled as the default character encoding for the system . This had little effect on English-speaking users , but enabled much easier internationalisation and seamless support for multiple languages , including ideographic , bi-directional , and complex script languages along with European languages . However , this did cause some negative reactions among existing Western European users , whose legacy ISO-8859–based setups were broken by the change .\nVersion 8.0 was also the second to include the Bluecurve desktop theme . It used a common theme for GNOME-2 and KDE 3.0.2 desktops , as well as OpenOffice-1.0 . KDE members did not appreciate the change , claiming that it was not in the best interests of KDE .\nVersion 9 supported the Native POSIX Thread Library , which was ported to the 2.4 series kernels by Red Hat .\nRed Hat Linux lacked many features due to possible copyright and patent problems . For example , MP3 support was disabled in both Rhythmbox and XMMS ; instead , Red Hat recommended using Ogg Vorbis , which has no patents . MP3 support , however , could be installed afterwards , although royalties are required everywhere MP3 is patented . Support for Microsofts NTFS file system was also missing , but could be freely installed as well .\nFedora .\nRed Hat Linux was originally developed exclusively inside Red Hat , with the only feedback from users coming through bug reports and contributions to the included software packages – not contributions to the distribution as such . This was changed in late 2003 when Red Hat Linux merged with the community-based Fedora Project . The new plan was to draw most of the codebase from Fedora when creating new Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions . Fedora replaced the original Red Hat Linux download and retail version . The model is similar to the relationship between Netscape Communicator and Mozilla , or StarOffice and OpenOffice.org , although in this case the resulting commercial product is also fully free software .\nVersion history .\nRelease dates were drawn from announcements on comp.os.linux.announce . Version names are chosen as to be cognitively related to the prior release , yet not related in the same way as the release before that .\nThe Fedora and Red Hat Projects were merged on September 22 , 2003 .",

    "story": "Ernst Ocwirk\nErnst Ocwirk ( 7 March 1926 – 23 January 1980 ) was an Austrian football player and coach . He is regarded as one of the greatest Austrian footballers of all time .\nHe spent the majority of his playing and coaching years between Austria and Italy , being both player and manager for FK Austria Vienna and Serie A club Sampdoria . He also went on to become a member of the Austria national team , which he led to a third-place finish at the 1954 World Cup as its captain .\nNicknamed Clockwork by the British for his midfield consistency , as well as the nickname being suggested by his surname , he is often cited as the last of the old-fashioned attacking centre-halves ; he was known for his aesthetic and technical style of playing , his heading ability , excellent timing ( both in offensive and defensive tasks ) and his passing range ; particularly his long passing ability . The fans loved him for his modest and fair personality . The international media of the era saw Ocwirk as the best centerhalf in the world . He is considered one of the greatest central midfielders of all time .\nClub career .\nBorn in Vienna , Ocwirk began his career as a striker . He joined his first club , the local FC Stadlau , in 1938 . He then played for Floridsdorfer AC , where he was spotted by former Austrian international Josef Smistik , who moved Ocwirk to centre midfield . Smistik tried to bring him to his former team , Rapid Vienna , but it was rivals FK Austria who won the race for his services and , in 1947 , signed him .\nIn a decade at Austria Vienna , Ocwirk became one of the most prominent players for the club , helping them to win five Austrian League championships and three domestic cups .\nBrought to Sampdoria by Alberto Ravano , he was the second Austrian footballer ever to play in Serie A after Engelbert König had done it in the 1940s . He also remained the last Austrian in Serie A until 1980 , when Herbert Prohaska played for Internazionale . Ocwirk would play five seasons at the Genova club , of which he became the captain . In 1961 , he returned to FK Austria to play the final season of his career , winning the double in 1961/62 .\nOcwirk was chosen in Austrias Team of the Century in 2001 .\nInternational career .\nOcwirk won 62 caps and scored six goals for his country . He made his debut for his country in 1945 before appearing at the 1948 Olympic Games in London .\nBy 1953 the stopper centre-back had taken over , so Ocwirk was selected as a wing-half for a Rest-of-the-World team which drew 4–4 with England to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Football Association . His international successes earned him the honour of twice being named captain of the FIFA World team .\nAt the 1954 World Cup , Ocwirk captained Austria and played in all five of his team matches , helping it achieve its best ever World Cup finish , third place . The centre-half scored two goals during the tournament : the one that gave Austria the lead after trailing 0–3 in the memorable quarter-final against hosts Switzerland , and the 3–1 in the third-place match against reigning champions Uruguay .\nCoaching .\nImmediately after retiring from playing , Ocwirk became a manager , and Sampdoria was the first team he coached , from 1962 to 1965 . He also managed German side 1 . FC Köln one year , taking them to the final of the DFB Cup .\nDeath and legacy .\nIn January 1980 , at the age of 53 , he died of multiple sclerosis , in Klein-Pöchlarn , Lower Austria . His death occurred on the same date that Matthias Sindelar died 41 years before .\nA friendly tournament was played in July 1981 in homage to Ernst Ocwirk at Wiener Stadion .

    "story": "Technical University Leuna-Merseburg\nTechnical University Leuna-Merseburg ( German : Technische Hochschule „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg , abbreviated : THLM ) was an institution of tertiary education in the city of Merseburg in todays Saxony-Anhalt , Germany . It was founded on 1 September 1954 as Technische Hochschule für Chemie Leuna-Merseburg ( THC ) and closed on 31 March 1993 . Hochschule Merseburg was founded on the grounds of THLM in 1992 .\nHistory .\nTechnische Hochschule für Chemie Leuna-Merseburg was founded in a ceremony held in Halle ( Saale ) on 1 September 1954 . The first 207 students were registered on 19 October 1954 in the club house of Leuna chemical works , the mathematician Herbert Dallmann ( 1909–1996 ) was appointed as the first rector on this occasion , and the foundation stone of the Merseburg campus was laid . Despite the name of the new institution , it never had any facilities in Leuna ; the name only referred to the largest chemical plant in the GDR .\nThe institution was founded with the aim of creating a Technische Hochschule ( TH ) that offered an application-oriented education in chemistry-related sciences and technology and supported the chemical industry in Central Germany . It can be regarded as a late consequence of the World Wars in the 20th century , and of the economical and political situation of the GDR that required an accelerated development of the industry . Several other institutions of tertiary education were founded at the same time .\nOriginally intended to be located in Leipzig , the new TH was finally established in the smaller and quieter city of Merseburg , situated between two major chemical plants ( Leunawerke with ca . 30000 employees and Buna Werke Schkopau with ca . 20000 employees ) . It was originally attached to the Ministry of Heavy Industries , in December 1955 it was transferred to the newly founded Ministry of Chemical Industry and finally in February 1958 to the State Secretariat and later Ministry of Higher and Technical Education .\nStudents accommodation was provided in dormitories on the campus or in a short distance thereof . Dormitory places not used by THLM students were used for students of the associated specialist Abitur classes or the Industrieinstitut ( which prepared industry workers without Abitur for studies at university level ) and also for younger staff members .\nA festival week was held every five years following the foundation of the THLM . On occasion of its tenth anniversary it was awarded the new name Technische Hochschule für Chemie „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg by the Council of Ministers of the GDR , from 1975 on the name was shortened to Technische Hochschule „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg .\nThe library of THLM was the first in the new states of Germany after German Reunification that joined the data network Deutsches Wissenschaftsnetz founded in May 1990 . In November 1990 THLM became a member of German Rectors Conference . The government of Saxony-Anhalt decided in December 1990 to liquidate the institution . The result of an evaluation by the German Council of Science and Humanities in March 1991 was published in June . According to it , the departments of chemistry , process engineering and materials and processing technology were found to perform efficiently and competitively , and should join Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg ( MLU ) . Integration was completed in 1993 , when the employees of THLM became employees of MLU . Closure of THLM was\nlegally stipulated on 28 February 1992 and juridically completed on 31 March 1993 . Incidentally , the last rector , Alfred Göpfert , who had only assumed the office on 14 December 1992 , was also a mathematician .\nRectors .\n- Herbert Dallmann ( 1909–1996 ) , mathematician , 1954 - 1955\n- Eberhard Leibnitz ( 1910–1986 ) , chemist , 1955 - 1958\n- Heinz Schmellenmeier ( 1909–1994 ) , physicist , 1958 - 1961\n- Elmar Profft ( 1905–1978 ) , chemist , March 1961 - December 1961\n- Rolf Landsberg ( 1920–2003 ) , chemist , 1962 - 1964\n- Hans-Joachim Bittrich ( 1923–2010 ) , chemist , 1964 - 1968\n- Hans-Heinz Emons ( born 1930 ) , chemist , 1968 - 1975\n- Gert Naue ( born 1934 ) , engineer in fluid mechanics , 1975 - 1981\n- Margit T . Rätzsch ( born 1934 ) , physical chemist , 1981 - 1989\n- Egon Fanghänel ( born 1935 ) , chemist , 1990 - 1992\n- Alfred Göpfert ( born 1934 ) , mathematician , 1992 - 1993\nStructure .\nFaculties and institutes .\nOriginally , THC was organised into faculties .\nAfter the academic senate had constituted itself in December 1955 , Faculty II for Sciences and Supplementary Technological Subjects was founded . It was the predecessor of the later Faculty for Process Engineering and Fundamental Sciences which was formed in September 1958 and was awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in August 1959 .\nThe Faculty for Material Sciences was formed in July 1956 and awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in November 1957 . The first doctorate was awarded to Hans-Jürgen Papenfuß in January 1958 , the first honorary doctorate in November 1958 to H . H . Franck .\nThe Faculty for Engineering Economics was also formed in 1956 and was awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in April 1961 .\nThe faculties were subdivided into institutes . Among them were ( in order of their opening ) :\n- 1954 : Institute of Anorganic Chemistry ; Institute of Mathematics ; Division of Social Sciences ; university library ( initially with 3000 books )\n- 1955 : Institute of Organic Chemistry ; Institute of Analytical Chemistry ( the only one of its kind in the GDR ) ; Institute of Physical Chemistry ; Division of Language Education ; Division of Studentical Sports\n- 1956 : Institute of Technical Physics ; Institute of Political Economy ; Institute of Organisation and Planning of Chemical Plants ; Institute of Normatives and Standardisation ; Institute of Accountancy and Finances ; Industrial Institute\n- 1958 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Polymers\n- 1959 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Mineral Salts ; Institute of Petroleum Chemistry ; Institute of Chemical Metals ; Institute of Marxism–Leninism ; Institute of Material Sciences and Mechanical Technologies\n- 1960 : Institute of Economy of the Chemical Industry ; Institute of Process Engineering\n- 1962 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Fundamental and Intermediate Organic Chemical Products\n- 1964 : Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering , Apparatus Technology and Project Designing ; the Institute of Technical Physics was divided into the Institute of Automatisation of Chemical Processes and the Institute of Technical Mechanics and Fluid Mechanics\n- 1967 : Institute of Socialist Economic Management ; the Institute of Petroleum Chemistry and Organic Intermediates was formed from the Institutes of Petroleum Chemistry and of Chemistry and Technology of Fundamental and Intermediate Organic Chemical Products ; the Institute of Anorganic and Technical Chemistry was formed from the Institutes of Chemical Metals and of Chemistry and Technology of Mineral Salts\nThe research department of the pharmaceutical works Fahlberg-List in Magdeburg was attached to THC as Forschungsinstitut Magdeburg in 1955 .\nSpecialist classes for chemistry .\nTHC was the first institution of tertiary education in the GDR to establish specialist Abitur classes in 1964 , with a specialist focus on chemistry . There , students who had passed an entrance exam were accepted after finishing the ten-year secondary school , and received specialist instruction in the sciences , in particular in chemistry , on top of the ordinary extended secondary school curriculum . They were already integrated into the university structures , attended lectures and seminars and practical classes in the laboratory , and were to a large extent educated by university teachers .\nRestructuring .\nThe university reforms of the late 1960s in the GDR caused changes in the organisational structure towards greater centralisation . Institutes were transformed into sub-departments ( Wissenschaftsbereich ) and grouped into sections ( Sektion ) ( comparable to departments ) . The following sections were formed :\n- Chemistry\n- Process Chemistry\n- Process Engineering\n- Polymer Sciences ( Hochpolymere )\n- Socialist Economic Management ( SBW )\n- Cybernetics/Mathematics/Data Processing ( KMD )\nNew sections were formed in 1972 from the latter two :\n- Economics\n- Mathematics and Computing Technology\nIn 1976 , the Sections of Process Chemistry and of Polymer Sciences were dissolved and partly attached to the Section of Chemistry . At the same time two new sections were formed :\n- Physics\n- Materials Sciences\nThere existed also a Section of Marxism–Leninism which had no students of its own , but provided the then obligatory education in Marxism–Leninism for the students of all other sections .\nAfter the German reunification , the faculty structure was reintroduced . In 1991 , the following faculties existed :\n- Faculty of Sciences\n- Department of Chemistry\n- Institute of Analytical and Environmental Chemistry\n- Institute of Anorganic Chemistry\n- Institute of Organic Chemistry\n- Institute of Physical Chemistry\n- Institute of Technical Chemistry\n- Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\n- Department of Physics\n- Institute of Theoretical Physica\n- Institute of Experimental Physics\n- Institute of Applied Physics\n- Faculty of Technological Sciences and Mathematics\n- Department of Mathematics and Infoematics\n- Institute of Analysis\n- Institute of Applied Mathematics\n- Institute of Informatics\n- Computer centre\n- Department of Process Engineering\n- Institute of Technical Fluid Mechanics\n- Institute of Fundamentals of Process Engineering\n- Institute of Thermal Process Engineering\n- Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering\n- Institute of Reaction Technology\n- Institute of System Process Engineering\n- Institute of Thechnical Thermodynamics and Energy Management\n- Institute of Automatisation and Electrical Engineering\n- Institute of Technology of Environmental Protection\n- Institute of Biotechnology\n- Department of Materials and Processing Technology\n- Institute of Plastics and Rubber Technology\n- Institute of Processing Technology and Rheology\n- Institute of Materials Technology\n- Institute of Technical Mechanics\n- Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences\n- Department of Economy\n- Institute of Business Management\n- Institute of Interdisciplinary Technological Research\n- Institute of Foreign Languages\nLiterature .\n- Dietrich Werner , D .

On July 30 , 2015 , MSNBC President Phil Griffin announced that the series had been canceled in an effort to transition the networks daytime programming to more breaking news reporting and less political commentary and opinion .\nFormat .\nThe Cycle was an ensemble program , with all four hosts appearing on every broadcast , each one taking turns to facilitating the discussion . Usually , the segment was named after the host leading the discussion : Touré TV , Abbys Road , Aris Angle , and Krystal Clear . Spin Cycle was a segment in which each host discusses a story ( usually political ) from their point of view . Guest Spot was a topical discussion with a featured guest of the day . The format was similar to The Five on rival news network Fox News , although the hosts and producers have denied that The Cycle is derivative . Ball , Melber and Touré are self-proclaimed liberal commentators while Huntsman is a self-proclaimed conservative .\nHistory .\nDylan Ratigans departure from MSNBC in June 2012 left a vacancy to fill in the networks schedule . Reports emerged that MSNBC planned to replace his show with a rotating group of hosts from the networks regular contributors .\nOn June 21 , 2012 , MSNBC announced the shows name , format and hosts , which included former Congressional candidate Krystal Ball , author Touré , Salon writer Steve Kornacki , and Daily News columnist S .

Cupp\nControversy .\nOn the June 27 , 2012 , broadcast of the program , co-host Touré hinted that U.S . Army Ranger and former professional American football player Pat Tillmans death was suspicious , due to the fact that the U.S . Military wouldnt have wanted such a high-profile soldier criticizing the mission in Afghanistan in 2004 .\nOn the July 5 , 2012 , broadcast , atheist co-host S.E . Cupp said that she would never vote for an atheist president . When asked to explain , Cupp said she felt that a president must not represent only 10 to 15 percent of the American populace and that faith served as a check on presidential power .\nOn the July 6 , 2012 , broadcast , Cupp accused Ann Romney , wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , of lying about her husbands potential running mate picks .\nOn the August 16 , 2012 , broadcast , Touré caused a controversy by stating that by calling President Barack Obama angry , Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was engaging in the niggerization of the president .

During his first two years with De Graafschap , Huntelaar played in various positions including left wing , attacking midfield , left back , and even goalkeeper ; only in his third year was he deployed as a striker .\nIn the 1997–98 season , the 14-year-old Huntelaar was the main striker for the C-team at De Graafschap and scored 33 goals in 20 matches .

However , this turned out to be his only appearance for PSV .\nDe Graafschap .\nBy the start of 2003 , it was clear that Huntelaars path into the first team was blocked , therefore he was sent out on loan to his previous club De Graafschap , where his uncle was financial director .

In the previous 25 years , only Dennis Bergkamp and Dirk Kuyt had managed that feat before their 25th birthday . Huntelaar finished the season with 33 goals in 34 appearances , becoming top scorer in the Eredivisie and the first Ajax player to score 30 league goals in a season for 21 years , since Marco van Basten in 1986–87 .\nAt the start of the 2008–09 season , Marco van Basten was appointed as Ajax coach and named Huntelaar permanent first team captain . Huntelaar scored nine goals in 15 appearances in all competitions before suffering torn ankle ligaments on 9 November 2008 in a league match against Sparta Rotterdam . He would not play again for fully eight weeks later and it turned out to be his last game for Ajax .\nReal Madrid .\nAt the start of December 2008 , Real Madrid reached an agreement with Ajax to sign Huntelaar in the mid-season transfer window in January .

UEFA rules would allow only one of the pair to be registered by 1 February 2009 and Diarra was selected to play in the competition .

Milan .\nOn 6 August 2009 , Huntelaar transferred to Serie A club A.C . Milan for €17.75 million , signing a four-year contract .

However , Huntelaar only appeared as a substitute for the next few matches , and because of the great form of teammate Marco Borriello , Huntelaar did not even appear as a substitute very often until Borriellos injury . Huntelaar capitalized on the opportunity by scoring his second brace of the season , helping Milan to a 3–2 defeat of Udinese . When Borriello hit bad form , Huntelaar was expected to play more often , but Leonardo chose to play veteran Filippo Inzaghi instead . On 3 April , Huntelaar started the match against Cagliari and scored from 30 meters out to stretch his goal tally to seven .\nSchalke 04 .\nOn 31 August 2010 , Bundesliga club Schalke 04 signed Huntelaar for a fee of €12 million .

    "story": "416th Flight Test Squadron\nThe 416th Flight Test Squadron is a United States Air Force squadron . It is assigned to the 412th Operations Group , Air Force Materiel Command , stationed at Edwards Air Force Base , California .\nDuring World War II , the 416th Bombardment Squadron was a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress squadron , assigned to the 99th Bombardment Group of Fifteenth Air Force . It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its performance in combat .\nMission .\nThe 416th performs flight testing on General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft .\nHistory .\nWorld War II .\nThe 416th was established in early 1942 as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress reconnaissance squadron but was redesignated as a heavy bomb squadron before activation in June . It trained under II Bomber Command in the Pacific Northwest , being deployed with B-17Es directly to the XII Bomber Command in North Africa shortly after the Operation Torch landings in March 1943 . In Algeria , the squadron engaged in combat operations in support of American ground forces in Algeria and Tunisia during the 1943 North African campaign .\nIn June 1943 , the 416th helped force the capitulation of Pantelleria Island . It bombed in preparation for and in support of the invasions of Sicily and southern Italy in the summer and fall of 1943 . In October 1943 the 416th was reassigned to the new Mediterranean Theater of Operations Fifteenth Air Force . Until the German capitulation in May 1945 , the unit engaged in strategic bombardment of enemy targets in Italy , France , Germany , Czechoslovakia , Austria , Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria , Yugoslavia , and Greece , attacking oil refineries , marshaling yards , aircraft factories , and other strategic objectives .\nAfter V-E Day , it was assigned to Air Transport Command Green Project , which was the movement of troops from Italy to staging areas in French Morocco . B-17s were dearmed with flooring and seats for 25 passengers installed . Each crew consisted of pilot , copilot , navigator and flight engineer . The 416th carried passengers from Tortorella and later from Marcianise Airfields to Port Lyautey Airfield , French Morocco , where transports moved them across the Atlantic or to Dakar for movement via the South Atlantic Transport Route .\nThe squadron was demobilized in Italy in late 1945 , and inactivated in November .\nReserves .\nThe unit was activated in the reserves in 1947 and possibly assigned some B-29 Superfortresses ; however , it was never fully equipped or manned , and was inactivated in 1949 due to budget restraints .\nF-16 flight testing .\nThe squadron was reactivated for flight testing of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1989 , after an inactivity of 43 years . The unit inherited the role of the 6516th TS that was also based at Edwards AFB . As the 6516th , the 416th was tasked with testing different weapon systems and specialized equipment on the F-16 in different production versions ( blocks ) .\nWeapons testing forms only a small part of the units task . Most weapons testing is conducted together with the Eglin AFB based testing squadrons . Some F-16s are painted in a regular gray USAF scheme for weapons testing , but other color schemes are used , such as white aircraft with red tails and ventral fins . These aircraft are often used as chase planes for other aircraft test programs .\nA variety of 416th F-16s are used to chase F-22s and F-35s . These aircraft are also relocated to other airbases all over the country , mostly going to Eglin AFB for testing assistance or to Fort Worth JRB for assistance to the Lockheed F-35 program .\nIn the 1990s the 416th helped in the development of the MLU upgrade package for older ( mainly European NATO countries ) F-16A/B models . The USAF eventually didnt get involved in the production process but did provide test aircraft #80-584 for this purpose . It is still flying with the squadron to test further enhancement packages for both MLU Vipers as for the USAF CCIP program\nIn the 1990s the 416th led the flight test effort in the development of the AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System . The performance of this interim solution was instrumental in the retirement of the F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft in the mid 1990s . The Air Force planned to replace the F-4G but the program was cancelled and the AN/ASQ-213 remains the primary F-16 SEAD mission sensor for the HARM missile more than 25 years later .\nThe unit briefly gained the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle test mission ( 2004-2005 ) . The F-15 fleet was sent to Eglin Air Force Base when the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters arrived in 2006 .\nDuring early 2009 , the squadron deployed to Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada and participated in a Red Flag exercise . This was the first of this type of deployment for any Air Force Material Command unit . Red Flag 09-2 ran from 26 January to 6 February 2009 . The reason for the deployment was to perform operational testing for the latest operating system M5.1+ software which is specific for the F-16 . The squadron took five aircraft all equipped with this latest software and flew 54 sorties .\nAnother deployment was organized for 23 January to 4 February 2012 , to test software for the 6.1+ operating system . The new software allows several improvements , such as ability to carry the Small Diameter Bomb . This will allow the F-16 to carry more weapons and deliver this munition from farther away . Although primary deployed to test , the 416th was also a participant with one pilot taking top Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ( SEAD ) pilot .\nFormer members of the 416th who have been hired by NASA to be astronauts include Mike Bloomfield , Duane Carey , Rex Walheim , Jim Dutton and Nick Hague .\nLineage .\n- 416th Bombardment Squadron\n- Constituted as the 26th Reconnaissance Squadron ( Heavy ) on 28 January 1942\n- Redesignated : 416th Bombardment Squadron , Very Heavy on 3 July 1947\n- Consolidated with the 6516th Test Squadron as the 6516th Test Squadron on 1 October 1992\n- 416th Test Squadron\n- Designated as the 6516th Test Squadron and activated on 10 March 1989\nAssignments .\n- 99th Bombardment Group , 1 June 1942 – 8 November 1945\n- 99th Bombardment Group , 17 July 1947 – 27 June 1949\n- 6510th Test Wing ( later 412th Test Wing ) , 10 March 1989\n- 412th Operations Group , 1 October 1993 – present\nStations .\n- MacDill Field , Florida , 1 June 1942\n- Pendleton Field , Oregon , 29 June 1942\n- Gowen Field , Idaho , 28 August 1942\n- Walla Walla Army Air Base , Washington , 30 September 1942\n- Sioux City Army Air Base , Iowa , 17 November 1942 – 3 January 1943\n- Navarin Airfield , Algeria , 25 March 1943\n- Oudna Airfield , Tunisia , 5 August 1943\n- Tortorella Airfield , Italy , 14 December 1943\n- Marcianise Airfield , Italy , c . 27 October–8 November 1945\n- Robins Field ( later Robins Air Force Base ) , Georgia , 17 July 1947 – 27 June 1949\n- Edwards Air Force Base , California , 10 March 1989 – present\nAircraft .\n- Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress , 1942–1945\n- Boeing B-29 Superfortress , 1947-1949\n- General Dynamics ( Lockheed-Martin ) F-16 Fighting Falcon , 1989–present\n- McDonnell Douglas F-15A/B/C/D/E Eagle/Strike Eagle , 2004-2005",

    "story": "Dries van Agt\nAndreas Antonius Maria Dries van Agt ( ; born 2 February 1931 ) is a Dutch politician and diplomat of the defunct Catholic Peoples Party ( KVP ) and later the Christian Democratic Appeal ( CDA ) party and jurist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 19 December 1977 until 4 November 1982 .\nVan Agt studied Law at the Radboud University Nijmegen obtaining a Master of Laws degree and worked as a criminal defense lawyer in Eindhoven from September 1955 until December 1957 and as a civil servant at the Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries and Justice from December 1957 until January 1968 . Van Agt worked as a professor of Criminal law and Criminal procedure at his alma mater from January 1968 until July 1971 and served as a judge at the district court of Arnhem from April 1970 until May 1971 . After the election of 1971 Van Agt was appointed as Minister of Justice in the Cabinet Biesheuvel I and taking office on 6 July 1971 . Van Agt was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1972 serving from on 23 January 1973 until 22 April 1973 . Following the cabinet formation of 1973 Van Agt continued as Minister of Justice in the Cabinet Den Uyl and also became Deputy Prime Minister taking office on 11 May 1973 . On 10 December 1976 Van Agt was selected as the first Leader and Lijsttrekker ( top candidate ) of the newly formed Christian Democratic Appeal for the election of 1977 . After the election Van Agt returned as a Member of the House of Representatives and became the Parliamentary leader taking office on 8 June 1977 and subsequently resigned from the cabinet on 8 September 1977 . Following a successful cabinet formation with Liberal Leader Hans Wiegel Van Agt formed the Cabinet Van Agt I and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office 19 December 1977 .\nFor the election of 1981 Van Agt again served as Lijsttrekker and following a cabinet formation with his predecessor as Prime Minister Labour Leader Joop den Uyl formed the Cabinet Van Agt II and continued as Prime Minister for a second term . The cabinet fell just seven months into its term and was replaced with the caretaker Cabinet Van Agt III with Van Agt continuing as Prime Minister and also serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs taking office on 29 May 1982 . For the election of 1982 Van Agt once again served as Lijsttrekker but shortly thereafter unexpectedly announced he was stepping down as Leader and that he wouldnt serve another term as Prime Minister . Van Agt left office following the installation of the Cabinet Lubbers I on 4 November 1982 but continued to serve in the House of Representatives as a backbencher .\nVan Agt continued to be active in politics and in May 1983 was nominated as the next Queens Commissioner of North Brabant taking office on 1 June 1983 . In December 1986 Van Agt was appointed as Ambassador of the European Union to Japan serving from 1 January 1987 until 1 January 1990 when he named as Ambassador of the European Union to the United States serving until 1 April 1995 . Van Agt retired from active politics at 64 and became active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served on several and councils on behalf of the government , he also served as a distinguished visiting professor of International relations , Peace and conflict studies and Governmental studies at the United Nations University , Kwansei Gakuin University , Kyoto University and Ritsumeikan University from February 1996 until May 2004 . Following his retirement Van Agt continued to be active public sector and worked as an advocate , lobbyist and activist for the Anti-war movement , Human Rights and the Two-State solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict .\nVan Agt was known for his abilities as a skillful Debater and negotiator . During his premiership , his cabinets were responsible for several major public sector and civil service reforms and further reducing the deficit following the recession in the 1980s . Van Agt continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until he suffered a major stroke in May 2019 which forced him to undergo rehabilitation . He holds the distinction as the oldest living and earliest serving former Prime Minister following the death of Piet de Jong in July 2016 and his premiership is consistently considered both by scholars and the public to have been average .\nEarly life .\nAndreas Antonius Maria van Agt was born on 2 February 1931 in Geldrop in the Netherlands Province of North Brabant in a Roman Catholic family . After receiving his diploma Gymnasium-A at the Augustinianum he studied at the Catholic University of Nijmegen , where he received his Doctorate in Law in 1955 . After graduating , he practiced law in Eindhoven until 1957 , after which he worked in the office of legal and business affairs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries until 1962 . From 1962 to 1968 , he worked for the Ministry of Justice .\nPolitics .\nMinister and Deputy Prime Minister .\nVan Agt entered politics as a member of the Catholic Peoples Party , which merged with the other two major Christian Democratic parties in 1980 to form the Christian Democratic Appeal ( CDA ) . From 1968 to 1971 , Van Agt was Professor of Criminal Law at the Catholic University of Nijmegen . From 1971 to 1973 , he was Minister of Justice in the government of Barend Biesheuvel . He caused outrage when he tried to pardon the last three Nazi war criminals still in Dutch prisons in 1972 . From 1973 to 1977 he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in the government of Joop den Uyl .\nLeader of the Christian Democratic Appeal .\nIn 1976 , Van Agt was elected the first Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal , then still a federation of the three religious parties Christian Historical Union , Catholic Peoples Party and Anti-Revolutionary Party , which first ran in 1977 with a united list ( the merger followed in 1980 ) . With Van Agt as top candidate , the Christian Democratic Appeal reversed in 1977 years of decline to return to power .\nPrime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt I .\nIn the parliamentary elections of May 1977 the Labour Party obtained their largest number of seats , so a second Den Uyl coalition looked likely . However , the tension between the Catholic Peoples Party and the Labour Party in the last reign , combined with the fact that a coalition between Christian Democratic Appeal and the Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy was possible , the talks failed after a period of seven months . Eventually Van Agt negotiated a deal with Hans Wiegel , leader of the Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy . From 19 December 1977 to 11 September 1981 Van Agt was Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs in the Cabinet Van Agt I .\nPrime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt II .\nIn 1981 , the Christian Democratic Appeal , Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy and Labour Party lost parliamentary seats , so a continuation of a Christian Democratic Appeal-Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy coalition was not possible . Van Agt , leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal , was forced to go in coalition with the Labour Party . Also Democrats 66 ( which , under Jan Terlouw gained a significant number of seats ) participated in the coalition talks , after 3 months of difficult negotiations that resulted in the Cabinet Van Agt II ( 11 September 1981 – 29 May 1982 ) . In this composition Van Agt worked with Joop den Uyl again as Den Uyl was made Deputy Prime Minister and super minister of Social Affairs and Employment . The characterological and political differences led to several divisions , and in May 1982 the government fell .\nThe personal strife between Van Agt and Den Uyl were so deteriorated that when Den Uyl died from a brain tumor in 1987 , Van Agt was not invited to the memorial by the family . Den Uyls wife Liesbeth argued that Van Agt had prevented the second Den Uyl coalition from forming in 1977 .\nPrime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt III .\nThe caretaker government went through as a minority cabinet , with only ministers from the parties Christian Democratic Appeal and Democrats 66 , in the Cabinet Van Agt III . For replacing the six Labour Party ministers , five new Christian Democratic Appeal and Democrats 66 ministers were in place , while van Agt in the cabinet , as well as being Prime Minister was also Minister of Foreign Affairs .\nNew parliamentary elections were organized for September 1982 . Although Van Agt , by this point was worn out , he was persuaded again to be Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal but shortly after the election he withdrew as a candidate for prime minister and was succeeded by Ruud Lubbers .\nAfter politics .\nDiplomat .\nDries van Agt served as Ambassador of the European Community to Japan from 1987 to 1990 and to the United States from 1990 to 1995 . From 1995 to 1996 , he was a Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Kyoto .\nProfessor .\nHe is currently Prime Counsellor for the International Forum for Justice and Peace , a foundation under Dutch law , registered at the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam . Chaired by retired international businessman Ben Smoes , they are currently focused on justice and peace in regard to the Israel/Palestine conflict\nActivist .\nVan Agt lectured in May 2006 in Cairo at the invitation of the Egyptian electronic magazine Arab-West Report about great changes in the cultural climate of north-western Europe in the past decades , becoming more hostile to religion , including Islam . Muslims , he argued , need to understand those changes to be able to respond better to European criticism on Islam and the Muslim world .\nVan Agt has also spoken against the Council of State in Egypt for continuous delay in granting the Center for Arab-West Understanding ( CAWU ) the NGO status . He met with prominent figures in Egypt to persuade them to do so . The Egyptian Council of State , after van Agts visit to Cairo in 2006 , ruled on 18 February 2007 that the center should be recognized as an NGO under Egyptian law , ending its three-year struggle to obtain this status . Egypt is known for its reluctance in granting NGO status to discourage political participation . Cornelis Hulsman , a Dutch sociologist , the editor-in-chief of Arab-West Report , and the head of CAWU , stated that van Agts effort significantly impacted the realization of their goals , which usually requires a lengthy amount of time and scrutiny in its political purposes .\nFor some years he has taken an outspoken stance regarding the Middle East , resulting in a fierce criticism of the policies undertaken by the government of Israel with regard to the Palestinians . When in office , van Agt was a staunch supporter of Israel , but after he stepped down in 1982 he changed his mind . According to his own words an important turning point was a visit at the late nineties at Bethlehem University on the Israeli-occupied West Bank . He has accused Israel of state terrorism and turning the Palestinian Authority territories into bantustans . In 2012 , Van Agt said that Jews should have a state in Germany instead of Israel . In September 2016 , in reference to the visit of Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netenyahu to the Netherlands , van Agt argued that the ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the building of settlements there constituted a war crime under the Rome Statute and suggested that Netenyahu should have been sent to the International Criminal Court .\nPersonal life .\nVan Agt is known for his use of archaic language and complicated phrasing , as well as for his love for cycling . He married his wife Eugenie Krekelberg in 1958 , and they have three children and seven grandchildren . In 2012 , he joined the Advisory Board of the International Museum for Family History .\nExternal links .\n- Official\n- Mr . A.A.M .

    "story": "Burton Cummings Theatre\nThe Burton Cummings Theatre is a theatre located in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada . Built by local impresario Corliss Powers Walker , it was originally known as the Walker Theatre . The building was renamed after singer-songwriter and Winnipeg native Burton Cummings in 2002 .\nHistory .\nWalker owned a number of South Dakota theatres along the Northern Pacific Railway route , which terminated at Winnipeg . Walker allied himself with a New York theatrical syndicate run by a Broadway firm called Klaw and Erlanger . The positioning of Walkers chain of theatres along the railway route helped bring big Broadway shows , and the chain was known as the Red River Valley Theatre Circuit .\nLots for the theatre were purchased in July 1905 . The theatre was constructed in 1906-07 , and might have opened in December 1906 if there had not been a labour strike . The Walker Theatre had a grand opening on 18 February 1907 featuring Puccinis Madame Butterfly . The theatre was designed by Montreal architect Howard C . Stone who was instructed to design a fireproof theatre following the principles of Chicagos Auditorium theatre . The theatre was originally planned as part of a hotel/office/retail complex , but of the plans , only the Walker Theatre was completed . This is why the external walls are plain - the original plans called for other attached buildings to abut all but the front of the theatre . The initial construction of the theatre cost $250,000 .\nThe buildings auditorium , lobby and lounges were decorated with Italian marble , plasterwork , gilt trim , velvet carpets , silk tapestries , murals and crystal chandeliers . The auditorium seated 1,798 people . The interior features vaulted ceilings , reaching a maximum of in height , huge sidewall arches , 2 curving balconies , a fly tower and broad wings . The top balcony was built for inexpensive ticket holders : it was steeply raked and furnished with wooden pew-like benches . The seat prices in the theatre ranged from 25 cents for seats in the balcony , up to $2.00 for seats in the orchestra . The two balconies were built without support posts or pillars , which allowed upper-level seats a clear view of the stage . The stage area was nearly wide , deep , and high . Behind the stage was a 3-storey block with hand elevator dedicated to dressing rooms , property rooms and scenery dock .\nThe theatre was built to be fireproof on account of the disastrous theatre fires in North America during that period , Walker having been impressed by the 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire . Fireproofing features included a steel cage system , many structural members being encased in concrete or terracotta , concrete floors ( covered with fire-resistant wool carpet ) , fire-retarding metal doors between spaces , brick and terracotta firewalls , and slate-covered metal stairways . Walker claimed it to be the first fireproof theatre in Canada .\nThe first performance in the theatre was performed before the grand opening , by Pollards Lilliputian Opera Company on 17 December 1906 , before the building had even reached completion . The building was used for live theatrical performances until 1933 . It was also used during this period for political rallies , including the labour and womens suffrage movements such as debates and a mock parliament that Nellie McClung took part in . The theatre was host to a 1918 political meeting of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council and the Socialist Party of Canada that led to the Winnipeg General Strike .\nIn 1933 , the theatre closed on account of the Great Depression , and in 1936 it was seized by the City of Winnipeg due to unpaid taxes . In 1944 , the theatre was purchased by theatre owner Henry Morton . Odeon Cinemas Canadian subsidiary converted the theatre to a cinema in 1945 . During the conversion to a cinema , many of the original surfaces were masked , and a false ceiling was put in to close off the upper balcony . The first film to play at the converted theatre was Blood on the Sun on 3 November 1945 .\nIn 1990 , the theatre was purchased by the not-for-profit Walker Theatre Performing Arts Group . The buildings original architectural features were restored , and it reopened as a venue for live performances in March 1991 . In 2002 , it was renamed after local musician Burton Cummings .\nThe theatre was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1991 . It was also designated a Provincial Heritage Site that same year .\nSignage on the front of the building was updated in 2017 by SRS Signs & Service , following a concept by Josh Dudych , the director of creative and marketing services at True North Sports and Entertainment .\nAcquisition by True North Sports & Entertainment .\nIn May 2014 , the theatre was leased to locally based True North Sports & Entertainment , who assumed management of the theatre and undertook critical repairs to the building . As part of the deal , a new board was formed to run the theatre , including members from True North , CentreVenture , Forks North Portage Partnership , and the former theatre board . In Spring 2016 , True North exercised its option to purchase the building from the Walker Theatre Performing Arts Group .",

    "story": "Jodi McKay\nJodi Leyanne McKay ( born 16 August 1969 ) is an Australian politician who was the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of New South Wales from June 2019 until May 2021 . She is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly , representing Strathfield for the Labor Party since 2015 , having previously represented Newcastle for one term from 2007 until her defeat at the 2011 election . Between 2008 and 2011 , McKay held a number of junior ministerial responsibilities in the Rees and Keneally governments , including serving as the Minister for the Hunter , Tourism , Small Business , Science and Medical Research , Commerce , and Women , and Minister Assisting the Minister for Health ( Cancer ) .\nEarly years and background .\nMcKay began her career as a journalist , eventually becoming a news anchor for NBN Television . She was among the first Australian news presenters to cover the September 11 attacks in the United States . She later entered the private sector in corporate communications and marketing . McKay also served on the Board of Hunter Medical Research Institute , the University of Newcastle Research Associates and Hunter Manufacturers Association , prior to entering politics .\nPolitical career .\nA member of Labor Right , McKay was installed as Labors candidate for Newcastle over the sitting member Bryce Gaudry , after Premier Morris Iemma intervened to ensure her selection . The controversy around the selection led to around 130 members of the Newcastle ALP branches , then the largest in the state , leaving or being expelled .\nThe subsequent election became a tight three-way contest between McKay , Gaudry , running as an independent , and the independent Newcastle lord mayor John Tate , with McKay winning on Gaudrys preferences .\nIn April 2008 , the NSW Greens were critical of McKay for failing to declare a political donation from a property developer group , Buildev , owned by Nathan Tinkler , to help pay for printing costs during her campaign . Buildev declared $50,000 in electoral donations to McKay , but McKay only declared a $1,000 donation from Buildev . At the time , Buildev was seeking support from the Minister for Planning , Frank Sartor , for a development at Medowie , near Newcastle Airport . McKay denied knowledge of the donation . The donation was made to Labors New South Wales head office . In 2011 , following a controversial proposal by another Tinkler company , Newcastle Ports , to build a coal loader at the port , McKay declined to meet company representatives , citing her need to remain uninvolved in the process .\nIn September 2008 , McKay was appointed to cabinet as the Minister for Tourism and Minister for the Hunter . She immediately distanced herself from the style of her predecessor Michael Costa , and committed to greater engagement with local government and community groups . Her appointment was welcomed by local tourism and business groups , including the Hunter Chamber of Commerce . McKay was also appointed as the Minister for Science and Medical Research , Minister assisting on Health , Minister for Commerce , Minister for Small Business , and Minister for Women .\nIn 2011 , McKay was reaffirmed as the Labor candidate for Newcastle by the partys national executive . At the 2011 election , McKay recorded a 31.0% share of the primary vote , her Liberal opponent received 36.4% , Tate had 11.5% and the Greens 14.6% . On a two-party preferred basis that translated into 52.4% for the Liberals Tim Owen and 47.6% for McKay .\nIn 2014 , McKay gave evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) that she was asked to accept an alleged bribe and reported the matter to the NSW Police , the ICAC and the Election Funding Authority . McKay told the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Tinkler had offered to bankroll her 2011 election campaign , in exchange for her support of his $1 billion coal loader project . Ms McKay gave evidence that she reported Mr Tinklers alleged bribe offer to police , ICAC , the Electoral Commission and the Electoral Funding Authority . McKay told him she could not accept his money because he was a banned donor . The ICAC inquiry revealed that after McKay knocked back the alleged bribe , Tinklers Buildev company , her colleague and senior Labor MP Joe Tripodi , and former Labor staffer Ann Wills , were involved in a pamphlet smear campaign that she believed contributed to her election loss . McKay was in tears in the ICAC witness box as confirmation of what she had long suspected came to light—they could not control me and they did not want me in the seat .\nCareer during political hiatus .\nAfter her election defeat , McKay held an executive role with Family Planning NSW and was a non-executive director of both Australian Science Innovations and Epilepsy Action Australia .\nAfter the first ICAC hearing , McKay said she would never return to politics . However , in October 2014 , McKay was installed as the Labor candidate for the seat of Strathfield for the next state election and , following her endorsement , was quoted as saying that she realised if you want change , it has to come from within .\nIn January 2015 , although she was not a member of Parliament , leader of the opposition Luke Foley appointed McKay to the shadow ministry as opposition planning spokeswoman .\nReturn to politics .\nAt the 2015 state election , McKay was elected as the member for Strathfield with an 8.2-point swing to Labor . In April 2015 , she was appointed as Shadow Minister for Police and Roads , Maritime and Freight . In 2016 , she was promoted to Shadow Minister for Transport and Shadow Minister for Roads , Maritime and Freight . In 2017 , she was preselected again as the Labor candidate for Strathfield for the 2019 state election , winning the seat with 55.1% on a two-party-preferred basis .\nLeader of the Opposition .\nFollowing Labors defeat in the 2019 election , the party leader , Michael Daley , resigned , and McKay expressed interest in running for the leadership . A leadership election was held in June 2019 , and McKay was elected as the leader of the NSW Labor Party , defeating Kogarah MP Chris Minns , winning 58.0% of the Labor caucus vote , and 63.0% of rank and file party membership vote . She thereby became the 39th NSW Leader of the Opposition . It was the first time that the premier and opposition leader in New South Wales were both women . McKay revealed her shadow ministry on 3 July 2019 .\nFollowing Labors defeat at the Upper Hunter by-election in May 2021 , McKay faced a possible leadership challenge . On 25 May 2021 , Shadow Treasurer Walt Secord resigned from her shadow cabinet , saying that it was well-known that Jodi McKay and [ he ] have disagreed on key policy , parliamentary and strategic decisions and directions and that he can no longer serve under her . The following day , a file titled Why Chris Minns and Jamie Clements can never run the NSW Labor Party was circulated from the office of the party deputy leader , Yasmin Catley . Minns , who was the Shadow Minister for Transport , was disappointed with the lack of explanation or communication from McKay and Catley over the file circulation and also resigned from the shadow cabinet . Facing pressure to unite the party , McKay resigned as party leader on 28 May 2021 .",

    "story": "Connie Morella\nConstance Morella ( ; née Albanese ; born February 12 , 1931 ) is an American politician and diplomat . She represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2003 . She served as Permanent Representative from the U.S . to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) from 2003 to 2007 . She is on American Universitys faculty as an Ambassador in Residence for the Women & Politics Institute . She was appointed to the American Battle Monuments Commission ( ABMC ) by President Barack Obama in 2010 .\nEarly life .\nShe was born Constance Albanese in Somerville , Massachusetts . After graduating from Somerville High School in 1948 , she attended Boston University , where she earned an Associate of Arts in 1950 and a Bachelor of Arts in 1954 . Although she was raised in a family of blue-collar Democrats , she became a Republican after meeting Anthony C . Morella , who had worked for liberal Republicans John Lindsay , Nelson Rockefeller , Charles Mathias , and others . After they wed , the couple moved to Bethesda , Maryland . After Connie Morellas sister died of cancer , Tony and Connie Morella adopted her six children to join their own three children .\nMorella became a secondary school teacher in the Montgomery County , Maryland public schools from 1957 to 1961 . She graduated from American University with an M.A . in 1967 and was an instructor there from 1968 to 1970 , when she became a professor at Montgomery College in Rockville , Maryland . She continued to teach until 1985 , then her political career gradually displaced her educational one .\nPolitical career .\nIn 1971 Morella was appointed as a founding member to the Montgomery County Commission for Women , an advisory womens advocacy body , and she was elected its president in 1973 . She became active in the League of Women Voters . In 1974 , she ran for the Maryland House of Delegates from the 16th District ( Bethesda ) , but did not win . She ran again in 1978 , winning the seat and receiving more votes than the three previous incumbents . She was reelected for an additional term , before running for United States Congress .\nCongressional career .\nIn 1986 , Morella ran for the open Congressional seat in Marylands 8th congressional district . The district was being vacated by Democrat Michael Barnes , who was running for the Democratic nomination to the U.S . Senate . Morellas opponent in the general election was State Senator Stewart Bainum , a multimillionaire business executive who consistently outpolled her throughout most of the campaign .\nA major turning point came when Morella unexpectedly won endorsements from The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post , an unusual feat for a Republican candidate in the race for an open Congressional seat in Maryland . Many analysts credit the endorsements for Morellas narrow victory in November . She was the first woman to hold this seat . Although a Republican in an area that had become heavily Democratic , she proved highly popular among her constituents and won re-election seven times , serving until 2002 .\nMorella opposes her partys positions on abortion , gun control , gay rights , and the environmental movement , voted for government funding of contraceptives and needle exchange programs for drug addicts , and favored the legalization of medical marijuana . She received some support from organized labor and opposed many tax cuts . Morella , however , voted against President Clintons 1993 budget , as all other Congressional Republicans did . She voted against declaring English the official language of the United States and , in 1996 , against a bill overwhelmingly approved by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton to combat illegal immigration .\nIn 1996 , Morella was one of only five Republicans to vote against the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act . In 1998 , she was one of only three Republicans to vote against renaming the Washington National Airport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport . Morella was the only Republican in the entire Congress to have voted against approving the use of military force in Iraq in 1991 and again in 2002 . She was active in human rights , womens health , and domestic violence issues in Congress , and served on the Science and Government Reform Committees .\nMorella was U.S . representative to the 1994 U.N . International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and co-chair of the Congressional delegation to the 1995 U.N . Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing . Among the legislation she sponsored were the 1992 Battered Womens Testimony Act , which provided funds for indigent women to hire expert testimony in domestic abuse cases , and the Judicial Training Act , which funded programs to educate judges about domestic violence , especially in child custody cases .\nMorella came under greater pressure after her party took control of the House in 1994 Congressional elections . Although she signed the Contract with America developed by Newt Gingrich , she had a mixed record supporting the subsequent Republican majority in Congress . She did not openly challenge the new House leadership until 1997 when she voted present for Speaker of the House instead of for the incumbent , Newt Gingrich . In 1998 , she was one of four Republicans , along with Amo Houghton and Peter T . King of New York and Chris Shays of Connecticut , to oppose all four articles of impeachment against Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal .\nAs a Republican representing an affluent Democratic district in an increasingly Democratic state , Morella faced a succession of increasingly strong Democratic challengers . While she managed to fend them all off , even in the big Democratic years of 1992 , 1996 , and 1998 , the low popularity of the Republican-controlled Congress gradually undermined her . She tried to portray herself as giving her district a place at the table , but over time , Morellas Democratic opponents claimed that a vote for Morella was a vote to keep Tom DeLay and other Republicans unpopular to district voters in power . It was taken for granted that Morella would be succeeded by a Democrat if she retired . It was also taken for granted that if Morella retired or was defeated in an election , Republicans would have great difficulty taking back the seat .\nElectoral challenges .\nMaryland Senate President Thomas V . Mike Miller stated that he intended to draw Morellas district out from under her after her relatively narrow reelection in 2000 . The Democrats controlled both the State Legislature and the Governors Office in 2000 , thus controlling the redistricting for the 2000 Census . Staffers from Senate President Miller , House Speaker Cas Taylor , and Governor Parris Glendening drew new maps to gerrymander out Morella and fellow moderate Republican Bob Ehrlich . One proposal went so far as to divide her district in two , effectively giving one to State Senator Chris Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular Delegate and Kennedy political family member Mark Shriver .\nThe final redistricting plan was less ambitious but still made the already heavily Democratic 8th district even more Democratic . It restored a heavily Democratic spur of eastern Montgomery County removed in the 1990 redistricting and added nine precincts in Prince Georges County from Al Wynns heavily Democratic . Although it forced Van Hollen and Shriver to run against each other in an expensive primary , Van Hollen defeated Morella in 2002 with 52 percent of the vote to Morellas 47 percent ( Morella would have narrowly won re-election in her previous district , according to election returns ) . Proving just how Democratic this new district is , the Republicans have only put up nominal challengers in the 8th since Morellas defeat ; none of them have ever won more than 40 percent of the vote .\nIn 2013 , Morella signed an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v . Perry case .\nAmbassador to the OECD .\nPresident George W . Bush appointed her United States Permanent Representative to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) on July 11 , 2003 .\nShe was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on July 31 and sworn in on October 8 of that year , becoming the first former member of Congress to serve as ambassador to the OECD . She is an honorary board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women who declared Morella a Feminina Excelente .\nShe officially served as Ambassador from August 1 , 2003 to August 6 , 2007 . In November 2007 , she was succeeded by Christopher Egan , son of Richard Egan .\nAwards and honors .\nMorella has received honorary doctorates from American University , 1988 ; Norwich University , 1989 ; Dickinson College , 1989 ; Mt . Vernon College , 1995 ; University of Maryland University College , 1996 ; University of Maryland , 1997 ; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences , 1997 ; Elizabethtown College , 1999 ; Washington College , 2000 ; and National Labor College , 2004 .\nHer numerous awards and recognitions include induction into the Maryland Womens Hall of Fame , the Ron Brown Standards Leadership Award , and public service awards from the American Medical Association , the American Bar Association , and the Hubert H . Humphrey Civil Rights Award from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights for selfless and devoted service in the cause of equality . The Republic of Italy awarded her the Medal of the Legion of Merit . She received the Foremother Award by The National Center for Health Research in 2008 .\nIn 2013 , she was awarded the Knight Commanders Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for putting energy and enthusiasm into growing the Congressional Study Group on Germany , which is the oldest and most active parliamentary exchange involving Congress and the legislative branch of another country during her tenure as President of the United States Association of Former Members of Congress .\nIn 2016 , she was conferred with Imperial Decorations by the Japanese government . For her contributions to deepen the U.S.-Japan alliance in the U.S . Congress , she was awarded with the Order of the Rising Sun , Gold and Silver Star .\nOn April 14 , 2018 , the Bethesda Library branch of the Montgomery County Public Libraries system was renamed the Connie Morella Library .\nElectoral history .\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Write-in and minor candidate notes : In 1996 , write-ins received 379 votes .

He also works as the club ambassador and youth team coach for Championship side Swansea City .\nTrundles career began in the English non-league system , where he played for Burscough , Chorley , Stalybridge Celtic , Southport and Bamber Bridge , before signing for Welsh Premier League side Rhyl . He managed to net 15 goals in 18 matches for Rhyl , and his performances earned him a move to Football League side Wrexham in 2001 . Trundle made a name for himself in professional football during a four-year spell for Swansea City , where he scored 78 goals in 146 appearances between 2003 and 2007 . In July 2007 , he left Swansea and signed with Bristol City , though he only scored 8 times in 3 seasons and was loaned out to both Leeds United and back to Swansea .\nIn 2010 , following his release from Bristol City , Trundle returned to the top tier of Welsh football and signed for Neath . He spent two years with the club , scoring 26 goals in 59 matches , but found himself a free agent once more when Neath were liquidated in 2012 . In a surprise move , Trundle rejoined the Football League in the summer of 2012 at the age of 35 , signing for League One side Preston North End . However , a lengthy injury saw him lose out on a first team position , and he left Preston in February 2013 through a mutual termination of his contract . Stints with non-league clubs Chester and Marine followed before Trundle retired from football at the age of 36 . However , in August 2016 , he came out of retirement to sign for Welsh Division Two club Llanelli Town , scoring 86 goals in 59 appearances during back-to-back promotions . In May 2018 , Trundle signed for Welsh Division One side Haverfordwest County on a week-by-week basis .\nEarly life .\nBorn in Liverpool , Merseyside , Trundle attended St Edmund of Canterbury Catholic High School in Huyton .\nPlaying career .\nEarly career .\nTrundle was a late entrant into professional and league football , playing for non-league teams Burscough , Stalybridge Celtic , Southport , Bamber Bridge and Chorley before joining Welsh Premier League club Rhyl in 2000 .\nWrexham .\nWithin six months , he had been snapped up by Brian Flynn to play for Wrexham where he played 78 matches ( plus a further 24 as substitute ) in all competitions and scored 30 goals in a little over two years . A goalscoring account which was started by a bicycle kick to start a second half comeback from 2–0 which culminated in a 3–2 victory for Wrexham against Walsall on 24 February 2001 .\nSwansea City .\nIn the summer of 2003 , Trundle received a free transfer and moved south to link up with Flynn who had now become manager of Swansea City . He instantly became a North Bank favourite with his goalscoring exploits and extraordinary tricks , scoring on his debut at the Vetch against Bury , and netting his first hat-trick for the club in the following match at Cheltenham , becoming the last of the three Swansea players who scored hat-tricks in three consecutive league matches , the only time this has happened for the club . Trundle scored 78 goals in 146 appearances for Swansea , making it by far the most prolific period of his career .\nIn his time at Swansea , Trundle became a minor celebrity in the match , with his extrovert displays of skill ( or showboating ) bringing him to national attention via the Soccer AM television show on Sky Sports .

He was believed to be the first player outside the Premier League to do so .\nBristol City .\nDespite the best efforts of Swansea City , Trundle agreed to sign for Bristol City on 27 July 2007 , although the deal was not officially completed until 30 July due to an administrative error . He was given permission by Swansea and the Welsh FA to play in Bristol Citys pre-season friendly against Yeovil Town before he officially completed the deal , scoring and providing an assist in a 2–2 draw at Ashton Gate . It is believed Bristol City made four offers for the striker . Their final offer of £1,000,000 was accepted after Trundle handed in a transfer request . Trundle scored his first goals , a brace , for Bristol City against Scunthorpe on 25 August 2007 .\nLeeds United .\nTrundle joined Leeds United on a one-month loan on 9 January 2009 and was allocated the number 35 shirt .

He scored his only goal for the club on his first starting appearance , in a 2–0 win at Brighton on 17 January .

Trundle subsequently refused the role .\nNeath .\nIn July 2010 , Trundle returned to the Welsh Premier League with Neath , making his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2010–11 season in a 2–1 defeat to Bangor City .\nNeath were wound up at the end of the 2011–12 season due to ongoing financial problems , leaving Trundle without a club .\nPreston North End .\nOn 20 July 2012 , Trundle signed a one-year deal with Preston North End . Trundle had impressed on trial at Deepdale after being invited to join up with the club for pre-season training . The 35-year-old featured for North End in their pre-season friendlies against Southport and Chorley and scored a superb solo goal in the draw against Chorley . However , shortly after signing for the Lilywhites , it was announced he had suffered a knee injury which manager Graham Westley believed would keep Trundle out for around 4 months . On 1 December , he appeared on the bench for a Second Round FA Cup tie at home against Gillingham , and he came off the bench in injury time during the 2–0 win for the Lilywhites .\nHe left Preston on 8 February through a mutual termination of his contract .\nChester .\nIt was announced on 18 February 2013 that the 36-year-old signed for Conference North side Chester until the end of the 2012–2013 season .\nMarine .\nOn 28 March 2013 , Northern Premier League side Marine confirmed that they had completed the signing of Trundle for an undisclosed fee . On 30 March 2013 he scored on his debut on against Nantwich Town . Trundle left Marine and retired from competitive football at the end of the season .\nLlanelli Town .\nOn 21 August 2016 , Trundle came out of retirement to sign for Welsh Football League Division Two club Llanelli Town . On 27 August 2016 , he scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 3–2 win against Aberdare Town . This was the first of nine hat-tricks across the season in all competitions for the veteran striker , as Llanelli went on to lift both the Division Two title and the Welsh Football League Challenge Cup . Trundle continued his impressive form in his second season at the club , scoring 33 goals in 28 appearances across all competitions as Llanelli won the Division One title by 15 points . However , the team missed out on a double-double by losing 2–1 to third-tier Trefelin BGC in the final of the Welsh Football League Challenge Cup . Following Llanellis promotion to the Welsh Premier League , Trundle announced on Twitter that he would be leaving the club as his work commitments as club ambassador for Swansea City would prevent him from travelling to away games further afield .\nHaverfordwest County .\nOn 29 May 2018 , Welsh Division One side Haverfordwest County announced that Trundle had agreed to join them for the 2018–19 season .

He led Bournemouth to victory in the inaugural Associate Members Cup by beating Hull City in the final . Bournemouth won the Third Division title in 1987 with 97 points , breaking the clubs record for the most points accumulated in a season .\nAfter two years at this level , Bournemouth were relegated at the end of their third season . Bournemouth were in 13th position on 3 March , but injuries which depleted the squad , combined with a catastrophic loss of form , meant they won only one more match that season , and were relegated on 5 May after a 1–0 defeat at Dean Court against Leeds United .\nRoad accident .\nIn June 1990 , while in Italy to watch the 1990 FIFA World Cup , Redknapp was involved in a road accident along with Michael Sinclair , the chairman of York City , Fred Whitehouse , the chairman of Aston Villa , and Bournemouths managing director , Brian Tiler . Travelling through Latina , south of Rome , at night , their chauffeur-driven minibus was in a head-on collision with a car containing three Italian soldiers . The minibus was flipped onto its roof and skidded 50 yards along the road . Sitting in the seat where Redknapp had usually sat during the trip , Tiler was killed , as were the three occupants of the other vehicle . Redknapp was doused in petrol and pulled clear of the accident by Sinclair . Redknapp suffered a fractured skull , a broken nose , cracked ribs and a gash in his left leg . Ambulance services arriving at the scene believed him dead and placed a blanket over his head . Unconscious for two days , Redknapp was flown home two weeks later in a special air ambulance paid for by Bournemouth . Though he made a full recovery , apart from losing his sense of smell and gaining a facial tic , he eventually quit Bournemouth at the end of the 1991–92 season .\nWest Ham United .\nFor the next season , Redknapp was appointed assistant manager to Billy Bonds at West Ham , another of his former clubs . However , in August 1994 , the club board of directors opted to turn control of the team over to Redknapp and move Bonds into an administrative role . Bonds eventually resigned outright from the club , leaving Redknapp solely in charge .\nJust months before being promoted to the managers seat at Upton Park , Redknapp was linked with the managerial vacancy at Southampton after the departure of previous manager Ian Branfoot , but the job went to Alan Ball instead .\nRedknapp helped to establish the club in the FA Premier League and introduced a number of young players from the clubs academy , including Michael Carrick , Joe Cole , Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard . The signings of Stuart Pearce , Paolo Di Canio and Trevor Sinclair helped them re-establish their careers having been signed by Redknapp . He also made mistakes in the transfer market , particularly with overseas players , including Marco Boogers , Florin Raducioiu and Paulo Futre .\nNevertheless , West Ham finished in eighth position in 1998 and fifth in 1999 , which saw them qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup in what was their second-best ever season in the top division . In the 1999–2000 season , West Ham won the Intertoto Cup and qualified for the UEFA Cup but failed to match their performances in the Premier League . Redknapp left West Ham on 9 May 2001 , one match before the end of the 2000–01 season . For some time , it was unconfirmed whether he resigned or was sacked but Redknapp shed new light on the true circumstances in October 2007 :\nPortsmouth .\nRedknapp became director of football for Portsmouth in 2001 , and when the Leicester City managers job became vacant with the dismissal of Peter Taylor that autumn , Redknapp was widely tipped to take over at the East Midlands club , but stayed loyal to Pompey , with the Leicester job going to Dave Bassett . Ironically , it was reported in the national media that had Redknapp taken over , Bassett would have been on his coaching staff at the East Midlands club .\nHowever , after the clubs poor form , he replaced manager Graham Rix in March 2002 . Redknapp managed the club to the Division One title in the 2002–03 season , gaining promotion to the Premier League , replacing his former club West Ham .\nRedknapp kept Portsmouth in the Premier League in the 2003–04 season , but had a dispute with Portsmouth owner Milan Mandarić over his assistant Jim Smith . Redknapp had another disagreement with Mandarić over the appointment of Velimir Zajec as director of football and resigned as manager in November 2004 .\nSouthampton .\nA few weeks after his departure at Portsmouth , Redknapp became manager of Southampton , a move which infuriated Portsmouths supporters , as the two clubs are fierce local rivals . Some fans even bore T-shirts which referred to Redknapp as Scummer and Judas and called for him to Rot in Hell .\nRedknapp was tasked with keeping Southampton in the Premier League – a similar task to the one Redknapp was facing with Portsmouth , and a familiar one at the club over the previous 15 years , which he would have faced had he accepted the offer to take over a decade earlier – but ultimately was unable to achieve this , ending Southamptons 27-year spell in the top flight . Redknapp remained in charge for the 2005–06 Championship season but was unable to establish consistency needed to make Southampton promotion contenders . Redknapp was also unhappy with chairman Rupert Lowes appointment of Clive Woodward to the clubs coaching staff . After being repeatedly linked with a return to Portsmouth after they sacked Alain Perrin , Redknapp resigned as Southamptons manager in early December 2005 . Lowe quoted Redknapp as referring to Portsmouth as his spiritual home .\nReturn to Portsmouth .\nRedknapp returned to Portsmouth on 7 December 2005 with the club threatened by relegation to the Championship , although not in the relegation zone . At first it looked like Redknapp would be heading for a second successive relegation , but a fine run of form at the end of the season , aided by the takeover of Portsmouth by Alexandre Gaydamak ( which provided Redknapp with more money ) , ensured Portsmouths survival . In the following season , Redknapp led Portsmouth to a ninth-placed finish which was the clubs highest league finish since the 1950s . In October 2007 , Redknapp signed a new contract at Portsmouth lasting until 2011 .\nIn January 2008 , it emerged through the media that Redknapp was offered the vacant managers job at Newcastle United following the sacking of Sam Allardyce . Redknapp had apparently declined the job , stating , I have a job to do to take this club forward and to walk away would not have been the right thing to do . It was later stated by Newcastle chairman Christopher Mort that Redknapp was interviewed for the job but he was only one of a number of people we were speaking to at that time , and at the time of Redknapps interview the club had already been in secret talks with the eventual appointee , Kevin Keegan , for a week .\nOn 8 March 2008 , Redknapp led Portsmouth to an FA Cup quarter-final victory over Manchester United , completing a hat-trick of FA Cup wins over Manchester United , and followed this with a semi-final victory over West Bromwich Albion at Wembley Stadium on 5 April . He guided the club to their first FA Cup Final in 69 years , where they defeated Cardiff City on 17 May 2008 to win The FA Cup 1–0 , thanks to a goal scored by Nwankwo Kanu . He is the last English manager to win a major English trophy .\nRedknapp returned to Portsmouth to receive the Freedom of the City in a ceremony on 28 October 2008 . As this event took place two days after his departure for Tottenham Hotspur , he received a mixed reception from the Portsmouth fans , despite having led the club to a long-awaited trophy in the 2008 FA Cup .\nTottenham Hotspur .\nIn October 2008 , following the sacking of Juande Ramos by Tottenham Hotspur , the club announced Redknapp had agreed to take over as the new manager at Spurs , the club where he began his playing career . Tottenham paid £5 million in compensation to Portsmouth for releasing Redknapp . Spurs had secured only two points from the first eight matches of the season prior to Redknapps arrival and lay bottom of the Premier League table , but in his first two weeks in charge , he took the club out of the relegation zone , winning 10 out of the 12 points available after wins against Bolton Wanderers , Liverpool and Manchester City , as well as a remarkable 4–4 draw against North London rivals Arsenal .\nIn January 2009 , Redknapp signed five new players in order to add quality and much-needed depth to his squad . He brought back Jermain Defoe from his old club Portsmouth for £15.75 million and Honduran midfielder Wilson Palacios from Wigan Athletic for £12 million . Long-serving Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini also joined on a free transfer ; former Spurs player Pascal Chimbonda returned to White Hart Lane from Sunderland for a fee in the region of £3 million ; and Robbie Keane , who like Chimbonda and Defoe had only left Spurs within the last year , re-joined after an unsuccessful spell at Liverpool for an initial fee of £12 million .\nIn the second half of the season , Spurs gradually moved up the league table after a significant improvement in form . In March 2009 , Redknapp led Spurs to the League Cup final , which they lost on penalties to Manchester United . Spurs eventually finished in eighth position with 51 points , narrowly missing out on a UEFA Europa League place .\nRedknapp made significant alterations to the squad in the summer of 2009 . Striker Darren Bent was sold to Sunderland for an initial fee of £10 million , while midfielder Didier Zokora departed for Sevilla for £7.75 million . In came England international striker Peter Crouch and Croatia midfielder Niko Kranjčar from Portsmouth for £9 million and £2 million respectively along with defender Sébastien Bassong from Newcastle United for £8 million .\nIn 2009–10 , his first full campaign with the club , Redknapp guided Spurs to one of their most successful Premier League campaigns to date . Beginning with four consecutive wins , Spurs went on to finish in fourth place with 70 points , therefore gaining the chance to qualify for the UEFA Champions League via a play-off . As a result of his efforts , he won the Premier League Manager of the Year award , only the second manager to do so in a season when his side did not win the title .\nOn 13 July 2010 , it was confirmed Spurs had extended Redknapps contract until the end of the 2013 season .\nOn 25 August 2010 , Spurs confirmed their position in the Champions League group stage by overturning a first-leg deficit to defeat Swiss team Young Boys at White Hart Lane in the Champions League play-off . After a surprising run to the quarter-finals , Spurs were eliminated in April 2011 after a 5–0 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid . Spurs ended the Premier League season in fifth position with 62 points . Although not enough to secure a second year of Champions League football , this finish instead meant that Redknapps Spurs qualified for the Europa League .\nIn the 2011–12 season , Redknapp signed 40-year-old goalkeeper Brad Friedel after his contract expired with Aston Villa . He also made a season-long loan move for Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor . On transfer deadline day , he signed English midfielder Scott Parker for an undisclosed fee from West Ham . Redknapp then went on to win the Premier League Manager of the Month award for September and November .\nDespite leading Tottenham to their second fourth-placed finish in three years and missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification only due to Chelsea winning the competition , Redknapp was sacked by Tottenham on 13 June 2012 , after reportedly failing to agree terms on a new contract .\nQueens Park Rangers .\nOn 24 November 2012 , Redknapp , who had been working at former club Bournemouth in an advisory role , was appointed as manager of Queens Park Rangers , taking over from Mark Hughes , whose contract was terminated the previous day . QPR were bottom with only four points from 12 matches . His first match in charge of QPR came on 27 November , a 0–0 draw away to Sunderland . Redknapp earned his first win as QPR manager , and the clubs first Premier League victory of the 2012–13 season , on 15 December after defeating Fulham 2–1 at Loftus Road .\nOn 2 January 2013 , Redknapp led QPR to a 1–0 victory away from home against reigning European champions Chelsea . This was QPRs first away win in the Premier League since November 2011 and their first top flight victory at Stamford Bridge since March 1979 . His first match against Tottenham since being sacked by the North London club came on 12 January 2013 , with Redknapp leading QPR to a 0–0 draw at Loftus Road .\nOn 28 April 2013 , after a 0–0 draw against fellow relegation rivals Reading , and with three matches of the season to play , QPR were relegated from the Premier League to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight . After a single season in the Championship , Redknapp managed QPR to a 1–0 victory in the Play-off Final against Derby County on 24 May 2014 at Wembley Stadium , returning the club to the Premier League . On 3 February 2015 , Redknapp resigned as manager of QPR . With an imminent knee operation , Redknapp said that he could not give 100% to the job and that it would be better for someone else to take over as manager . Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey were placed in temporary charge . In April 2015 , Redknapp expanded on his reasons for leaving QPR , stating he had also left the club because he no longer knew who was on my side . At his time of departure , QPR were in second-last position in the Premier League with 19 points from 23 matches and a record zero points from away matches .\nJordan .\nIn March 2016 , Redknapp was appointed manager of Jordan national team alongside his former assistant , Kevin Bond , for the countrys next two qualifying matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup . Redknapps first match as Jordan manager , on 24 March , ended in an 8–0 win over Bangladesh . This was followed by a 5–1 defeat to Australia .\nBirmingham City and retirement .\nOn 18 April 2017 , Redknapp was announced as the manager of Birmingham City until the end of the season after the resignation of Gianfranco Zola . His first match in charge was a 1–0 loss to local rivals Aston Villa . The final two matches of the season saw Redknapps team beat Huddersfield Town 2–0 , followed by a 1–0 away win at Bristol City , allowing Birmingham to escape any threat of relegation .\nIn May 2017 , Redknapp signed a one-year deal to continue as Birmingham manager for another season . Kevin Bond was reunited with Redknapp as assistant manager , replacing the outgoing Steve Cotterill . His first signings were David Stockdale , Marc Roberts and Cheikh NDoye .\nOn 16 September 2017 , after five straight league defeats that left the team second bottom in the table , a statement from Birmingham City said the club were left with no choice but to terminate the contract of the manager with immediate effect . After his sacking , Redknapp said that there was every chance his role as Birmingham manager would be his last managerial job . A month later , Redknapp confirmed his retirement from management after 34 years in the dugout .\nOther roles .\nIn January 2016 , Redknapp made a return to football as a director at Wimborne Town . In March 2016 , he was named as a football advisor for Derby County until the end of the 2015–16 season .\nOn 29 April 2016 , it was announced that Redknapp was to join Australian side Central Coast Mariners as a football consultant .\nIn October 2017 , following his departure from Birmingham City , Redknapp briefly joined League Two club Yeovil Town in a voluntary advisory role to manager Darren Way .\nOn 8 February 2021 , Redknapp returned to Bournemouth to assist caretaker manager Jonathan Woodgate .\nCorruption allegations and arrest .\nOn 19 September 2006 , Redknapp was shown on camera by BBC Panorama taking part in what appeared to be an interest in approaching a player in a manner forbidden by FA rules . Redknapp denied that his conversation about then-Blackburn Rovers player Andy Todd with the football agent Peter Harrison amounted to tapping up or improperly approaching the player . Redknapp referred to Todd as a tough bastard during the conversation and suggested he would be interested in signing the player on a full-time basis if he was available . Redknapp told the BBC he has never taken a bung and had given Kevin Bond no reason to think otherwise and that he considers himself to be one million percent innocent .\nIn the final report of the Stevens inquiry , published in June 2007 , the only criticism of Redknapp concerned his ownership of a racehorse named Double Fantasy thought to have been given to him by the agent Willie McKay , which has aroused some suspicion . Redknapp told the inquiry it was possible he did own the horse but insisted he had not made any money out of it because the horse was a failure and never won a race .\nOn 28 November 2007 , Redknapp , along with Portsmouths managing director Peter Storrie , former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić , agent Willie McKay and footballer Amdy Faye had been arrested by City of London Police on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting . Redknapp was later released without charge and announced his intention to sue the police because of his arrest , considering it as the reason for the failure of the FA to consider him for manager of the England national team after the sacking of Steve McClaren . The High Court ruled in May 2008 that the raid by City of London Police officers , on Redknapps home in Poole , was illegal and quashed the search warrants , calling their actions wholly unacceptable and ordering them to pay £1,000 damages to Redknapp as well as part of his legal costs .\nFollowing further investigation by HM Revenue & Customs as part of the corruption enquiry , in January 2010 , Redknapp was charged with two counts of cheating the public revenue , along with Milan Mandarić . The charge related to a £189,000 payment from Mandarić to Redknapp via a bank account in Monaco . The trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 23 January 2012 . Part of Redknapps defence was that he was both dyscalculic and dyslexic and therefore had difficulty in dealing with transfer contracts . He was found not guilty on both counts on 8 February 2012 .\nEngland managers job .\nRedknapps acquittal came just hours before the resignation of England national team head coach Fabio Capello . Two days later , he refused to rule himself out of the running for the job , but said it would be very difficult to combine the role with his then position as Tottenham manager . A few weeks later , the FA appointed Roy Hodgson as manager .\nPersonal life .\nRedknapp and his wife Sandra have two sons : Jamie , a football pundit and former professional footballer ; and Mark , a model . Jamie made his professional debut under his father at Bournemouth in 1990 before moving on to Liverpool and later Tottenham Hotspur and lastly Southampton before retiring in 2005 . Harrys grandson via his son Mark , also called Harry Redknapp , signed for Bournemouth during May 2014 . His nephew is former England midfielder Frank Lampard , Jr . whose parents are Sandras late twin sister , Patricia , and Harrys former teammate and managerial assistant Frank Lampard , Sr .\nRedknapp and his wife are the fundraising presidents for the Southampton-based charity Leukaemia Busters , a role they took over in 2004 previously held by former cricketer David Gower and his wife Thorunn .\nRedknapp and his wife also own a property development company , Pierfront Developments . In August 2011 , it was announced that a housing development their company was building in Southsea , Hampshire , would go ahead without affordable housing . The £600,000 they offered to the council to build affordable homes elsewhere , was accepted by the council . Opponents of the scheme estimated this will only be enough to build eight homes instead of the 28 that council policy says they should be building in this development . In October 2019 , planning permission was granted for the company to convert a homeless shelter in Bournemouth into flats , despite pleas from residents who told planning authorities that the development would exacerbate homelessness and put their welfare at risk .\nIn January 2011 , Redknapp was mugged while attending a football match in Madrid . On 2 November 2011 , he had an operation to unblock coronary arteries . Redknapp wrote for the online gambling company , Betfair , as its Euro 2012 columnist .\nIn 1998 Redknapp published his autobiography , Harry Redknapp : My Autobiography . It was co-written with Derek McGovern . His second autobiography , Always Managing , was published in 2013 . It was ghostwritten by journalist Martin Samuel .\nRedknapp was a contestant in the 2018 series of Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here ! He subsequently won the show , and was crowned King of the Jungle .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\nEngland U18\n- UEFA European Under-18 Championship : 1964\nManager .\nAFC Bournemouth\n- Associate Members Cup : 1983–84\nWest Ham United\n- UEFA Intertoto Cup : 1999\nPortsmouth\n- Football League First Division : 2002–03\n- FA Cup : 2007–08\nTottenham Hotspur\n- Football League Cup runner-up : 2008–09\nQueens Park Rangers\n- Football League Championship play-offs : 2014\nIndividual\n- Premier League Manager of the Season : 2009–10\n- Premier League Manager of the Month : November 1998 , April 2004 , October 2004 , March 2005 , April 2006 , August 2009 , September 2011 , November 2011\nBibliography .\nAutobiography .\n- Harry Redknapp : My Autobiography ( CollinsWillow , 1998 )\n- Always Managing : My Autobiography ( Ebury Press , 2013 )\n- A Man Walks On To a Pitch : Stories from a Life in Football ( Ebury Press , 2014 )\n- It Shouldnt Happen to a Manager ( Ebury Press , 2016 )\nExternal links .\n- Harry Redknapp West Ham United statistics\n- Harry Hotspur – The Start of a revolution Shelfside Spurs",

    "story": "LNER Class A4 4488 Union of South Africa\n60009 Union of South Africa is a LNER Class A4 steam locomotive built at Doncaster Works in 1937 . It is one of six surviving A4s . Its mainline certification expired in April 2020 . As the locomotive is subject to a boiler inspection , it will be moved to the East Lancashire Railway until 2022 , when it will be permanently withdrawn and placed on static display . It was briefly renamed Osprey during part of the 1980s and 1990s due to political opposition against apartheid in South Africa at the time .\nNames .\nBuilt by the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) in 1937 at Doncaster Works and originally numbered 4488 , it was named after the then newly formed Union of South Africa . It had previously been allocated the name Osprey on 17 April 1937 , but was renamed to operate The Coronation . It eventually carried the name Osprey in the 1980s and 1990s . This was due to the contemporary political opposition against South Africa , which undertook a controversial policy of racial apartheid from 1948 to 1994 . The name Osprey had previously been carried by A4 No . 4494 ( renamed after the LNER director Andrew K . McCosh after 1942 ) and LNER Peppercorn Class A1 No . 60131 from 1949 to 1965 . 60009s name has since reverted to Union of South Africa . The works number was 1853 ; the plaques are located in the cab itself and not on the exterior cab sides as is the usual practice .\nPlaque .\nThe springbok plaque on the side of the locomotive was donated on 12 April 1954 by a Bloemfontein newspaper proprietor . Only the one plaque was fitted on the left hand side of the locomotive . Two cast Springbok plaques were given to John Cameron in the mid 1970s and these were mounted on the cabsides . They have since been removed during overhauls but the original boiler side plaque remains . 60009 is fitted with an American , Crosby chime whistle in common with other members of its class .\nLiveries .\nUnion of South Africa has worn many liveries throughout its career . The first livery it wore was as 4488 in garter blue , applied on 19 April 1937 . The next livery applied was LNER wartime black on 21 March 1942 . This livery was amended on 14 August 1943 when the L and R were removed to confuse potential spies , leaving the all-black locomotive with just NE on the tender . 21 February 1947 saw Union of South Africa regain garter blue with red and white lining . Its number was changed to just 9 on 12 January 1946 , under the renumbering scheme of Nigel Gresleys successor , Edward Thompson . It gained a stainless steel number 9 during this repaint . On 4 August 1949 , 60009 was repainted in the standard British Railways express passenger blue livery as 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley . Finally on 2 October 1952 , Union of South Africa was painted in British Railways green livery . It has worn this livery throughout preservation to date .\nTechnical details .\nAs with all 35 of the Gresley A4 pacific steam locomotives , Union of South Africa was fitted with streamlined valances , or side skirting , when it was built . This was found to hinder maintenance and , as with the rest of the class , it was removed . 4488 lost its valances during a works visit 21 March 1942 .\nBoilers .\n60009 has been fitted with 14 boilers during ts career : 8951 , 9129 ( a new-build boiler fitted 9 November 1940 ) , 8955 ( from 4492 Dominion of New Zealand , 13 January 1945 ) , 9128 ( from 2512 Silver Fox , 9 February 1946 ) , 8957 ( from 4490 Empire of India , 5 May 1948 ) , 9027 ( from 60028 Walter K Whigham , 4 August 1949 - this boiler was renumbered 29279 on 23 November 1950 ) , 29285 ( from 60032 Gannet , 22 April 1954 ) , 29278 ( from 60013 Dominion of New Zealand , 18 November 1958 ) , 27965 ( a new-build boiler , 17 February 1960 ) , 27961 ( from 60024 Kingfisher , 19 July 1961 ) and 29337 ( from 60023 Golden Eagle , 6 November 1963 ) .\nTenders .\n60009 has had five tenders through its career , of two differing types . The first tender it had was a 1928 pattern streamlined corridor tender . This was a rebuild of a tender fitted to a Class A1 or A3 beforehand , being streamlined and fitted to 4488 from new . This was later changed for a new-build streamlined corridor tender from 1948 - 1963 . After its withdrawal , 60009 donated its tender for conversion to a second , water carrying only tender for 4472 Flying Scotsman . Currently 60009 is fitted with a 1928 pattern streamlined corridor tender , allowing its cab crew to be changed whilst the locomotive is hauling passenger trains . This tender was originally fitted to the LNERs experimental high-pressure Nº 10000 . The tenders it has had were : 5325 ( 17 April 1937 – 22 March 1948 ) , 5636 ( 5 May 1948 – 14 May 1948 ) , 5591 ( 14 May 1948 – 16 July 1963 ) , 5332 ( 6 November 1963 – 1 June 1966 ) and 5484 ( 17 July 1966 – 10 September 1966 ) .\n60009 had a double chimney fitted on 18 November 1958 . This feature was first fitted to 4468 Mallard back in 1938 . As the safety requirements were tightened after the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash , Automatic Warning Systems was fitted to all locomotives . 60009 was so fitted on 17 February 1960 . At the same time this was done , a Stone-Smith type speed recorder was also fitted .\nCareer .\nUnion of South Africa was allocated to Haymarket shed in Edinburgh from new and 20 May 1962 it had its only shed transfer to Aberdeen .\nOn 24 October 1964 it hauled the last booked steam-hauled train from London Kings Cross . It was twenty minutes late through Grantham owing to a broken rail at High Dyke . It was the last steam locomotive to be overhauled at Doncaster whilst in service in November 1963 . It was withdrawn from British Railways service on 1 June 1966 .\nPreservation .\nPurchased by John Cameron in July 1966 , 60009 was preserved on the now-defunct Lochty Private Railway in Fife , Scotland , travelling the of track near Anstruther .\nIn 1973 , the loco left the Lochty Private Railway by road and was taken to Ladybank to be placed back on the National Network , from there it was taken to Kirkcaldy and was based in the former goods shed and worked occasional tours based from the Fife town . After a few years at Kirkcaldy , it moved to Markinch and took up residency in the former goods shed where it stayed until May 1994 with the exception of a couple of years in a shed in the yard at nearby Thornton .\nFollowing the 1989 overhaul , it started to work railtours all over the United Kingdom . These have ranged from Plymouth in the south-west to Inverness in the north , from Holyhead in the west to Norwich in the east , it has also visited numerous main line connected preserved railways . It has since accumulated the highest mileage of any locomotive in the class .\nIn May 1994 , the locomotive left its Markinch base for the last time albeit on the back of a low loader bound for the Severn Valley Railway , Bridgnorth for repairs . Its route took it over the Forth Road Bridge and in doing so became the only steam locomotive to cross both the Forth Bridge and the adjacent road bridge .\nAfter a repair in January 2007 , it left the Severn Valley Railway and went to Crewe for fitment of on-train monitoring recorder ( OTMR ) equipment . In April 2007 it returned home to Scotland , with the Railway Touring Companys The Great Britain railtour being the first work and thence to its new base at Thornton . During 2007 , it hauled the regular Scarborough Spa Express from York to Scarborough via Knaresborough , Harrogate and Leeds .\nIn 2008 , it was continuing to work with the Railway Touring Company , scheduled to pull trains running between York and Edinburgh on several occasions during the first half of 2008 . Union of South Africa appeared at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway LNER Festival 2008 , along with 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley and 60019 Bittern , the first time that all three locomotives were together in preservation .\nIn light of the expiration of its boiler certificate , Union of South Africa arrived at Pete Watermans LNWR Workshops at Crewe in 2010 , undergoing an extensive overhaul . It returned to steam in mid-2012 , hauling its first tours for the West Coast Railways on 22 and 23 July .\nOn 9 September 2015 , 60009 hauled a train carrying Queen Elizabeth II along with Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to re-open officially the Borders Railway between Edinburgh Waverley and Tweedbank .

    "story": "Helmut Brandt ( CDU politician in East Germany )\nHelmut Alfred Brandt ( 16 July 1911 - 31 October 1998 ) was a Berlin city councillor and a leading German politician in the Christian Democratic Union ( Christlich-Demokratische Union / CDU ) , a political party of the centre right .\nAfter 1945 the eastern part of Berlin , where Brandt lived and worked , was administered as the Soviet occupation zone of what had been Germany . By 1949 , when the occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) , it was in the process of becoming a second German one-party dictatorship . Helmut Brandt opposed of this development : he was ousted from his job with the ministry of Justice and his position as a member of the CDU party leadership team . On 6 September 1950 he was arrested , although he would have to wait another four years for any sort of trial . He was accused of activities hostile to the state ( staatsfeindlicher Arbeit ) and he spent the years between 1950 and 1964 in prison .\nLife .\nEarly years .\nBrandt was born in Berlins Spandau quarter . At university he studied jurisprudence and , obtaining doctorates in both related disciplines , following which he took a job with Deutsche Bank . In the meantime , in 1929 he joined the German Peoples Party ( Deutsche Volkspartei / DVP ) , undertaking secretarial duties for the party in the Reichstag from 1931 until 1933 , when a change of regime led to the DVP being outlawed . Following a brief period working at the , in 1938 Brandt joined a legal firm that specialised in matters involving international civil law .\nWar broke out in 1939 and Brandt fought as a member of the German army on both the eastern and western fronts . For some of the time he was based in Berlin , however , working at the Ministry for Military Procurement . War ended in May 1945 and almost immediately , in June 1945 , he was able to return to Berlin and set himself up as a freelance lawyer , also taking a part-time teaching post at Berlin University .\nSoviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic .\nIn 1945 there was a widespread assumption that the destruction of Nazi Germany should open the way for a return to multi-party democracy . Helmut Brandt was a founder member of the Christian Democratic Union ( Christlich-Demokratische Union / CDU ) , intended as a slightly more broadly based version of the DVP that had existed before the abolition , in 1933 , of parliamentary democracy . He quickly became the partys expert on legal issues . The next year , however , April 1946 saw the creation of a new political party within the Soviet occupation zone , the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED ) , formed through a contentious merger of the old German Communist Party and ( many of the elements of ) the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party . During the next few years the authorities sought to move towards a new one-party dictatorship , not by banning the other political parties but by controlling them . This was achieved by placing them all into an umbrella organisation known as the National Front and itself controlled by the SED ( party ) . In the end it was only in the Soviet occupation zone ( reinvented , formally in October 1949 , as the German Democratic Republic / East Germany ) that a return to single-party dictatorship was achieved , and even here implementation of the strategy was far from smooth , and stretched out over several years . With the CDU in his part of Germany increasingly under state pressure from without and infiltrated within , in 1948 Helmut Brandt joined the pro-Soviet District Federation ( Landesverband ) in the eastern sector of Berlin . In West Berlin this led to accusations that he was leading a split of the CDU which still saw itself as a single political party across all the allied occupation zones in what was left of Germany after 1945 . It was also in 1948 that Helmut Brandt was appointed as one of the 45 CDU members of the first and co-opted as a member of the assembly committee charged with drawing up a new constitution . By this time . however , the CDU leadership in the Soviet occupation zone was undergoing internal fragmentation , dividing those who , for various reasons , were prepared to collaborate , whether willingly or not , with the constitutional developments being implemented by the ruling SED ( party ) from those , such as Georg Dertinger and Helmut Brandt , who were less so . On account of his bourgeois-conservative propensities Brandt now found himself forced out of positions of influence within the CDU , notably by Arnold Gohr of the East German partys collaborationist wing . It was Gohr who replaced him as chairman of the District Federation ( Landesverband ) in what was becoming known as the Soviet sector of Berlin .\nIn October 1949 Helmut Brandt was appointed as a secretary of state in the new countrys Justice Ministry . In May 1950 he protested to his minister Max Fechner ( SED ) and to his own party leader in East Germany , Otto Nuschke ( CDU ) over the , a succession of rapid legal hearings of 3,324 of people who had survived and been released from the hitherto unacknowledged Soviet controlled concentration camps . These now had their cases processed and were sentenced in fast-track hearings at which Brandt ( and others ) felt that justice was poorly served .\nArrest and imprisonment .\nIn September 1950 he was arrested by people working for the Ministry for State Security ( Stasi ) . Four years of pre-trial detention ensued , most of which he spent in an underground cell at the Stasi Hohenschönhausen detention centre . In 1953 he found himself arbitrarily linked by the Stasi with the group of conspirators connected with Georg Dertinger who was arrested at the start of that year , and in June 1954 the Supreme Court of East Germany sentenced Brandt , during a secret trial , to ten years of imprisonment for working against the state ( staatsfeindlicher Arbeit ) . The ten-year sentence was later reduced , formally , to eight years , though as matters turned out he remained in prison , apart from a few days in 1958 till 1964 .\nBy 1958 Brandt had been transferred to the from where he was released as an act of clemency in September . However , he was issued with a residency permit which required him to remain in the Dresden area . Thirty-six hours later he was re-arrested by the Stasi while trying to escape to West Berlin : his arrest resulted from a concern on the part of the authorities that he was about to speak to western journalists . A further trial took place , this time at Frankfurt ( Oder ) on 13 March 1959 , at which Brandt received another ten-year jail sentence for crimes that included espionage , inducing people to escape from the German Democratic Republic , producing propaganda that endangered the state and treason .\nFreedom .\nAfter 5,095 days in prison Helmut Brandt was released in August 1964 . He was one of the first of approximately 34,000 East German political prisoners to have their by the West German government between 1964 and 1989 as part of a ( at the time secret ) scheme to try and compensate for East Germanys desperate shortage of cash . Brandt promptly relocated to the Rhineland region of West Germany , employed by various universities and working , till 1977 , as an expert consultant to the government in Bonn . In the west he was prevented from resuming his political career with the CDU , but in 1977 joined its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union ( Christlich-Soziale Union in Bayern / CSU ) .\nFollowing reunification Brandt devoted time and effort to researching the infamous . In 1998 he died after a long illness at Königswinter , across the river from Bonn .",

Since 2019 he has served as a Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) . A former Mayor of Girona , Puigdemont served as the 130th President of Catalonia from 2016 to 2017 when he was removed from office by the Spanish Government following the unilateral Catalan declaration of independence . He is co-founder of the National Call for the Republic ( CNxR ) , leader of the Together for Catalonia ( JuntsxCat ) electoral alliance and founder of the Together for Catalonia party .\nAfter education in Amer and Girona , he became a journalist in 1982 , writing for various local publications and becoming editor-in-chief of El Punt . He was director of the Catalan News Agency from 1999 to 2002 and director of Gironas House of Culture from 2002 to 2004 . Puigdemonts family were supporters of Catalan independence and Puigdemont became involved in politics as a teenager , joining the nationalist Democratic Convergence of Catalonia ( CDC ) , the predecessor to the PDeCAT , in 1980 . He gave up journalism to pursue a career in politics in 2006 when he was elected as a member of the Parliament of Catalonia for the constituency of Girona . He was elected to the Municipality Council of Girona in 2007 and in 2011 he became Mayor of Girona . On 10 January 2016 , following an agreement between the Junts pel Sí ( JxSí ) , an electoral alliance led by the CDC , and the Popular Unity Candidacy ( CUP ) , the Parliament of Catalonia elected Puigdemont as the 130th President of the Government of Catalonia .\nOn 6–7 September 2017 , he approved laws for permitting an independence referendum , and the juridical transition and foundation of a Republic , a new constitution for Catalonia that would be in place if the referendum supported independence . On 1 October 2017 , the Catalan independence referendum was held in Catalonia despite Spains Constitutional Court ruling that it breached the Spanish constitution . Despite the closing of polling stations and the use of excessive force by Spanish Police 43% of Catalan citizens managed to vote in the referendum , 92% of them supporting independence . The Catalan Parliament declared independence on 27 October 2017 which resulted in the Spanish government imposing direct rule on Catalonia , dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government . The Catalan Parliament was dissolved and the 2017 Catalan regional election was held . On 30 October 2017 charges of rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds were brought against Puigdemont and other members of the Puigdemont Government . Puigdemont , along with others , fled to Belgium and European Arrest Warrants ( EAW ) were issued against them .

Puigdemont called for fresh talks with the then Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy but these were rejected .\nPuigdemont remained in Belgium to avoid arrest if he returned to Spain , with this situation being defined as exile by some , self-imposed exile by some others , and also as fugitive from justice . On 25 March 2018 , he was detained by the Autobahnpolizei ( highway patrol ) acting on his European Arrest Warrant in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein . He was released on bail , with the state high court deciding he could not be extradited for rebellion as German law does not coincide with Spanish law on the definition thereof , a requirement of his EAW . On 10 July 2018 a Spanish Supreme Court judge suspended him as a deputy in the Catalan parliament . On 12 July 2018 , a German court decided that he could be extradited back to Spain for misuse of public funds , but not for the more serious charge of rebellion . Puigdemonts legal team said they would appeal any decision to extradite him . Following the German court decision , on 19 July 2018 , Spain dropped the European arrest warrants against Puigdemont and other Catalan officials in self-exile .\nEarly life and family .\nPuigdemont was born on 29 December 1962 in Amer , a village in the comarca of la Selva in the province of Girona in north-eastern Catalonia , Spain .

In 1983 , aged 21 , Puigdemont was involved in a car accident which left him seriously injured and with a slight scar on his face . It has been suggested that this explains his Beatle haircut but friends deny this .\nJournalism career .\nPuigdemont joined the El Punt , a pro-independence Catalan language newspaper , as a journalist in 1982 . He rose through the ranks to become the papers editor-in-chief . He also wrote a weekly column for the Presència magazine .

He was re-elected at the 2010 , 2012 and 2015 regional elections , the latter as a Junts pel Sí ( JxSí ) electoral alliance candidate .\nPuigdemont contested the 2007 local elections as a CiU candidate in Girona and was elected but the CiU remained in opposition . At the 2011 local elections , in which Puigdemont we re-elected , the CiU ended the Socialistss 32-year rule in Girona . Puigdemont became Mayor of Girona . He was re-elected at the 2015 local elections . He was a member of Executive Committee of the Association of Municipalities for Independence and in July 2015 succeeded Josep Maria Vila dAbadal as its chair .\nFollowing a last-minute agreement between pro-Catalan independence parties Junts pel Sí and Popular Unity Candidacy to replace Artur Mas due in part to the various alleged cases of corruption and the austerity cuts under his government , Puigdemont was elected the 130th President of Catalonia on 10 January 2016 . He resigned as Mayor of Girona on 11 January 2016 as no-one is allowed to be a regional president and a municipal mayor at the same time . He was the first President of Catalonia to refuse to take the oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution and the Spanish monarch .\nConstitutional crisis .\nIn June 2017 Puigdemont announced that the Catalan independence referendum would be held on 1 October 2017 . The Catalan Parliament passed legislation on 6 September 2017 authorising the referendum which would be binding and based on a simple majority without a minimum threshold . The following day Constitutional Court of Spain suspended the legislation , blocking the referendum . The Spanish government put into effect Operation Anubis in order to disrupt the organisation of the referendum and arrested Catalan government officials . Despite this the referendum went ahead though it was boycotted by opponents of secessionism and turnout was only 43% . Among those who voted 92% supported independence . Around 900 people were injured as the Spanish police used violence to try to prevent voting in the referendum .\nOn 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament declared independence in a vote boycotted by opposition MPs . Almost immediately the Senate of Spain invoked article 155 of the constitution , dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government and imposing direct rule on Catalonia . The following day Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for fresh regional elections on 21 December 2017 . On 30 October 2017 Spanish Attorney General José Manuel Maza laid charges of rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds at the Audiencia Nacional against Puigdemont and other members of the Catalan government . The charges carry maximum sentences of 30 , 15 and 6 years in prison respectively .\nPuigdemont and five other Catalan ministers ( Dolors Bassa , Meritxell Borrás , Antoni Comín , Joaquim Forn and Meritxell Serret ) arrived in Belgium on 30 October 2017 . According to Spanish media the group had driven to Marseille shortly after the charges were laid before the Audiencia Nacional and from there flown to Brussels . Puigdemont claimed that he had gone to the capital of Europe to speak from a position of freedom and safety and that he would not return to Spain unless he was guaranteed a fair trial . Earlier Belgiums Secretary of State for Asylum , Migration and Administrative Simplification Theo Francken had stated that prospect of Puigdemont being granted asylum was not unrealistic .\nExile .\nOn 3 November 2017 a Spanish judge issued European Arrest Warrants against Comín , Clara Ponsatí i Obiols , Lluís Puig , Puigdemont and Serret after they failed to attend a high court hearing in Madrid the previous day . On 5 November 2017 the five politicians , accompanied by their lawyers , surrendered to the Belgian police but after a ten-hour hearing a Belgian judge released them all on bail . They were ordered not to leave Belgium without permission and had to provide details of their accommodation . On 5 December 2017 the Supreme Court of Spain withdrew the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) against Puigdemont and four others stating that EAW were not valid for alleged crimes committed by a wider group of people , e.g . the Catalan government . But judge warned that the national arrest warrants remain valid , meaning that the group risked arrest if they returned to Spain .\nWhile remaining self-exiled , Puigdemont contested the 2017 regional election as a Together for Catalonia ( JuntsxCat ) electoral alliance candidate in the Province of Barcelona and was re-elected to Parliament . At the election Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament . After the election Puigdemont called for new unconditional talks with the Spanish government and that he was willing to meet Rajoy outside of Spain . Rajoy rejected the offer , saying that he was only willing to speak with the leader of the Catalan government , whom he considered to be Inés Arrimadas , leader of the unionist Citizens , the largest single party in the Catalan Parliament .\nOn 1 March 2018 , Puigdemont was hoping to be selected by the Catalan Parliament as President of Catalonia again , but the Catalan Parliament heeded warnings from Spains judiciary and postponed the session in which Puigdemont could be selected . Subsequently , Puigdemont announced that he was no longer seeking re-election as leader of Catalonia . Later he announced the creation of a government-in-exile organization named Council of the Republic .\nOn 25 March 2018 , while returning to Brussels from a trip to Finland , Puigdemont was stopped in Germany near the Danish border and arrested pursuant to the European warrant that had been reissued against him two days previously . On 5 April 2018 , the Oberlandesgericht ( Higher State Court ) in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein ruled that Puigdemont would not be extradited on charges of rebellion , and released him on bail while deliberating about the extradition on charges of misuse of public funds . According to that decision , Puigdemont was required to report to police once a week and could not leave Germany without permission of the public prosecutor .\nAfter his release , Puigdemont called on Spains government to release Catalan separatists from imprisonment and establish a dialog with them .\nOn 12 July 2018 the higher court in Schleswig-Holstein confirmed that Puigdemont could not be extradited by the crime of rebellion , but may still be extradited based on charges of misuse of public funds . Puigdemonts legal team said they would appeal any decision to extradite him . Ultimately , though , Spain dropped its European arrest warrant , ending the extradition attempt . Puigdemont was once again free to travel , and chose to return to Belgium .\nIn January 2019 Puigdemont filed a constitutional application for amparo directed against the president of the Catalan parliament , Roger Torrent and the Board of the Chamber . The complaint , presented to the Spanish Constitutional Court , argued Puigdemont had been denied the use of his political rights as Torrent did not allow him to delegate his vote from Belgium after Puigdemonts criminal indictment and suspension of his parliamentary condition by Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena .\nFollowing the April 2019 arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , Puigdemont said that Human rights , and especially freedom of expression , are under attack once again in Europe .\nPuigdemont ran 1st in the list for the 2019 European Parliament election in Spain and he was elected member of the European Parliament . However , he refused to attend the act of observance of the Spanish Constitution before the Junta Electoral Central in Madrid , a requirement to acquire a certificate as a Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) . The consequential absence of Puigdemont and Toni Comín in the list of certificated Spanish MEPs was communicated to them by the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani through a letter ; the letter also explained that , therefore , he could not address them as MEPs . Puigdemont and Comín filed a request before the General Court of the European Union asking for precautionary measures against the decision of the European Parliament , which was dismissed . He spent much of the inaugural session of the European Parliament on 2 July 2019 in the German city of Kehl , across the Rhine from the seat of the European Parliament in the city of Strasbourg , located on French soil and avoided by Puigdemont . Judge Pablo Llarena has reactivated a detention order of Puigdemont both in Europe and also reactivated an international detention order of Puigdemont in October 2019 .\nOn 20 December 2019 , Puigdemont was accredited as an MEP after a ruling from the European Court of Justice said that he was permitted to take on his role as MEP .\nPuigdemont and Comín attended their first EP session on 13 January 2020 as non-attached members . Puigdemont first intervention dealt with a defense of the right of self-determination . Both MEPs asked to join the Greens–European Free Alliance ( EU parliament party political group ) co-president Philippe Lamberts acknowledged the group considered the request a problem for them and , while entertaining internal debate in order to decide on the issue , Lamberts deemed the most logical outcome would be for them to join the group to which their best Belgian friends ( the N-VA ) belong . Also in January 2020 , Spanish Supreme Court judge Manuel Marchena proceeded to file an application before EP President David Sassoli in order to revoke the immunity of Puigdemont and Comín .\nLater in January 2020 , just hours before the scheduled internal vote among the Greens/ALE MEPs on the request filed by Puigdemont and Comín to join the Greens/ALE group , both Puigdemont and Comín withdrew their application .\nOn 30 April 2021 , Morocco granted Puigdemont asylum . According to a source from the Moroccan foreign ministry , the decision was made in due to the principle of reciprocity to host the Catalan independence leader after Sahrawi President Brahim Ghali was allowed to go to Spain to get treated for COVID-19 .\nIdeology and positions .\nOne of the founders of the youth organization of the right-of-centre Democratic Convergence of Catalonia ( CDC ) in the province of Girona , Puigdemont has associated himself since then with the most staunchly pro-independence faction in the party . His tenure as Mayor in Girona was characterised by liberal economic policies . In 2017 , he considered the European Union to be a club of decadent and obsolescent countries that was controlled by a small few , also suggesting that Catalonia should be allowed to vote on its exit from the EU if Catalans wanted it . Although he openly supports the EU and Euro , he has supported the idea that we should work to change it . He has rejected a EU which does not protect human rights and the right of representation . He has denied being europhobic and he has referred to himself and his party not as eurosceptic but as euro-demanding .\nPersonal life .\nPuigdemont married Romanian journalist Marcela Topor in 2000 . They have two daughters , Magali and Maria , and live in Girona . He speaks Catalan , English , French , Romanian and Spanish . Puigdemont is a supporter of Girona FC and FC Barcelona and plays rock guitar and the electric piano . As a youngster Puigdemont played bass in a short-lived Catalan rock band formed about 1980 .\nOn 2 February 2018 , the Belgian commune of Waterloo confirmed that he had rented a villa and planned to establish his official residence there .\nReferences .\n- Informational notes\n- Citations\nExternal links .\n- Catalan Parliament profile ( archive )\n- European Parliament profile\n- Generalitat de Catalunya .

    "story": "Edward Short , Baron Glenamara\nEdward Watson Short , Baron Glenamara , ( 17 December 1912 – 4 May 2012 ) , often known as Ted Short , was a British Labour politician and deputy leader of the Labour Party . He was Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Newcastle upon Tyne Central and served as a minister during the Labour governments under Harold Wilson , before being appointed to the House of Lords shortly after James Callaghan became Prime Minister .\nFollowing the death of James Allason on 16 June 2011 , Short was the oldest living former member of the British House of Commons .

He served as a Captain in the Durham Light Infantry of the British Army during the Second World War . After leaving the army , he returned to teaching , becoming Newcastle branch secretary of the National Union of Teachers and in 1947 , head of Princess Louise Boys School , Blyth .\nHaving joined the Labour Party in 1942 , Short was elected a councillor on Newcastle City Council in 1948 , where he led the Labour Group within two years . He was first elected to Parliament for Newcastle upon Tyne Central at the 1951 general election . He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1964 , and was made a Companion of Honour in 1976 .\nPostmaster General .\nShort was responsible for the outlawing of pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline .

Short was seen at the time as a safe pair of hands . His main rival for the job was the left-winger Michael Foot who was viewed by many on the centre and right of the party as a divisive figure . Short defeated Foot and Anthony Crosland in the same vote .\nLord President of the Council .\nShorts new seniority was reflected in his appointment as Lord President of the Council – though not Deputy Prime Minister – 1974–76 , but he did not have the stature to mount a leadership bid himself on Wilsons retirement . He was not offered a Cabinet post on James Callaghans election as Premier . His resignation letter said that the time had come for him to step aside for a younger man ; this was sarcasm , as he was replaced by Michael Foot , who was only seven months younger than himself . Short was also nine months younger than Callaghan , who had dropped him from the cabinet .\nPeerage .\nHe was made a life peer as Baron Glenamara , of Glenridding in the County of Cumbria on 28 January 1977 , a few months after he had left the Commons .

    "story": "Alexander Strehmel\nAlexander Strehmel ( born 20 March 1968 ) is a German football manager and a former professional player who played as a defender or midfielder . He manages Michigan Stars FC .\nPlaying career .\nStrehmel began his career with VfB Stuttgart , and broke into the first team during the 1986–87 season , in which he made sixteen appearances in the Bundesliga . He continued to play steadily over the next few years , and helped the club to the 1989 UEFA Cup Final , although he missed the entire second half of the 1988–89 season , including final itself ( a defeat against Napoli ) . Three years later came the greatest success of Strehmels career as VfB Stuttgart won the Bundesliga title . He made 25 appearances during the season , as the club overhauled Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund with a 4–2 win over the latter on the last day of the season to become German champions . Strehmel played in the match as a late substitute for Andreas Buck , with the score at 3–1 .\nBy the 1993–94 season , Strehmel was used less frequently ( only thirteen appearances ) , so he left Stuttgart in July 1994 , after over 150 league appearances for the club . He signed for SG Wattenscheid 09 of the 2 . Bundesliga , where he spent two seasons , the second of which saw the club relegated in last place . Strehmel stayed in the second tier , though , signing for SpVgg Unterhaching .\nIn the 1998–99 season , Unterhaching finished in second place , earning promotion to the Bundesliga , where they would spend the next two seasons . The first season they finished a very respectable tenth , and were involved in another dramatic title race - their 2–0 win over Bayer Leverkusen on the last day of the season handing the German championship to their neighbours Bayern Munich . However , Unterhaching finished 16th the following season , and this relegation was followed by another - they finished 15th in the 2 . Bundesliga and were relegated to the Regionalliga Süd . They immediately bounced back as champions , before Strehmel left the club midway through the 2003–04 season , returning to the Regionalliga Süd to join FC Augsburg . He retired from football at the end of the 2004–05 season , after only eight appearances in eighteen months for Augsburg .\nInternational career .\nStrehmel was part of the West Germany under-20 team that went to the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship in Chile . He played in all six matches as West Germany reached the final , scoring once in a group game against Saudi Arabia . He also scored a penalty in the shoot-out in the final against Yugoslavia , but West Germany lost 5–4 . Strehmel also won 8 caps for the under-21 team between 1988 and 1990 .\nCoaching career .\nSince retiring from football , Strehmel has been a coach , usually working as assistant to Lorenz-Günther Köstner , who had been his manager at SpVgg Unterhaching . The pair have worked at Rot-Weiss Essen , TSG 1899 Hoffenheim , and VfL Wolfsburg II .\nHe became coach at Michigan Stars FC of the National Independent Soccer Association , the US third tier .\nHonours .\n- UEFA Cup finalist : 1989\n- Bundesliga : 1992",

    "story": "Leopold Kronecker\nLeopold Kronecker ( ; 7 December 1823 – 29 December 1891 ) was a German mathematician who worked on number theory , algebra and logic . He criticized Georg Cantors work on set theory , and was quoted by as having said , ( God made the integers , all else is the work of man ) . Kronecker was a student and lifelong friend of Ernst Kummer .\nBiography .\nLeopold Kronecker was born on 7 December 1823 in Liegnitz , Prussia ( now Legnica , Poland ) in a wealthy Jewish family . His parents , Isidor and Johanna ( née Prausnitzep ) , took care of their childrens education and provided them with private tutoring at home—Leopolds younger brother Hugo Kronecker would also follow a scientific path , later becoming a notable physiologist . Kronecker then went to the Liegnitz Gymnasium where he was interested in a wide range of topics including science , history and philosophy , while also practicing gymnastics and swimming . At the gymnasium he was taught by Ernst Kummer , who noticed and encouraged the boys interest in mathematics .\nIn 1841 Kronecker became a student at the University of Berlin where his interest did not immediately focus on mathematics , but rather spread over several subjects including astronomy and philosophy . He spent the summer of 1843 at the University of Bonn studying astronomy and 1843–44 at the University of Breslau following his former teacher Kummer . Back in Berlin , Kronecker studied mathematics with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and in 1845 defended his dissertation in algebraic number theory written under Dirichlets supervision .\nAfter obtaining his degree , Kronecker did not follow his interest in research on an academic career path . He went back to his hometown to manage a large farming estate built up by his mothers uncle , a former banker . In 1848 he married his cousin Fanny Prausnitzer , and the couple had six children . For several years Kronecker focused on business , and although he continued to study mathematics as a hobby and corresponded with Kummer , he published no mathematical results . In 1853 he wrote a memoir on the algebraic solvability of equations extending the work of Évariste Galois on the theory of equations .\nDue to his business activity , Kronecker was financially comfortable , and thus he could return to Berlin in 1855 to pursue mathematics as a private scholar . Dirichlet , whose wife Rebecka came from the wealthy Mendelssohn family , had introduced Kronecker to the Berlin elite . He became a close friend of Karl Weierstrass , who had recently joined the university , and his former teacher Kummer who had just taken over Dirichlets mathematics chair . Over the following years Kronecker published numerous papers resulting from his previous years independent research . As a result of this published research , he was elected a member of the Berlin Academy in 1861 .\nAlthough he held no official university position , Kronecker had the right as a member of the Academy to hold classes at the University of Berlin and he decided to do so , starting in 1862 . In 1866 , when Riemann died , Kronecker was offered the mathematics chair at the University of Göttingen ( previously held by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Dirichlet ) , but he refused , preferring to keep his position at the Academy . Only in 1883 , when Kummer retired from the University , was Kronecker invited to succeed him and became an ordinary professor . Kronecker was the supervisor of Kurt Hensel , Adolf Kneser , Mathias Lerch , and Franz Mertens , amongst others .\nHis philosophical view of mathematics put him in conflict with several mathematicians over the years , notably straining his relationship with Weierstrass , who almost decided to leave the University in 1888 . Kronecker died on 29 December 1891 in Berlin , several months after the death of his wife . In the last year of his life , he converted to Christianity . He is buried in the Alter St Matthäus Kirchhof cemetery in Berlin-Schöneberg , close to Gustav Kirchhoff .\nScientific activity .\nMathematics research .\nAn important part of Kroneckers research focused on number theory and algebra . In an 1853 paper on the theory of equations and Galois theory he formulated the Kronecker–Weber theorem , without however offering a definitive proof ( the theorem was proved completely much later by David Hilbert ) . He also introduced the structure theorem for finitely-generated abelian groups . Kronecker studied elliptic functions and conjectured his liebster Jugendtraum ( dearest dream of youth ) , a generalization that was later put forward by Hilbert in a modified form as his twelfth problem . In an 1850 paper , On the Solution of the General Equation of the Fifth Degree , Kronecker solved the quintic equation by applying group theory ( though his solution was not in terms of radicals : that was already proven impossible by the Abel–Ruffini theorem ) .\nIn algebraic number theory Kronecker introduced the theory of divisors as an alternative to Dedekinds theory of ideals , which he did not find acceptable for philosophical reasons . Although the general adoption of Dedekinds approach led Kroneckers theory to be ignored for a long time , his divisors were found useful and were revived by several mathematicians in the 20th century .\nKronecker also contributed to the concept of continuity , reconstructing the form of irrational numbers in real numbers . In analysis , Kronecker rejected the formulation of a continuous , nowhere differentiable function by his colleague , Karl Weierstrass .\nAlso named for Kronecker are the Kronecker limit formula , Kroneckers congruence , Kronecker delta , Kronecker comb , Kronecker symbol , Kronecker product , Kroneckers method for factorizing polynomials , Kronecker substitution , Kroneckers theorem in number theory , Kroneckers lemma , and Eisenstein–Kronecker numbers .\nPhilosophy of mathematics .\nKroneckers finitism made him a forerunner of intuitionism in foundations of mathematics .\nHonours .\nKronecker was elected as a member of several academies :\n- Prussian Academy of Sciences ( 1861 )\n- French Academy of Sciences ( 1868 )\n- Royal Society ( 1884 ) .\nThe 25624 Kronecker asteroid is named after him .",

    "story": "Ruth Boynton\nRuth Boynton ( 1896 – 1977 ) was a physician , researcher , and administrator who spent almost her entire career at the University of Minnesota . She worked in public health and student health services . At that time , there were few women in any of these fields . She was Director of the University Student Health Service from 1936 to 1961 . It was renamed the Boynton Health Service in her honor in 1975 .\nEarly life and education .\nRuth Evelyn Boynton was born in La Crosse , Wisconsin on January 3 , 1896 . She was the daughter of Ervin and Nellie Alice ( Parker ) Boynton . She decided to become a doctor while she was in high school . Her family physician , Dr . Mary P . Houck , was said by an early colleague and friend of Ruth Boynton , William Shepard , to have set an example that influenced Boyntons decision . Dr . Mary P . Houck cared for Boyntons two brothers during their final illnesses , when they were 12 and 20 years old and Nelly Boynton who also died during Ruths youth . She started college at La Crosse State Normal School and transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Madison . She graduated with a major in Medical Sciences and coursework in Latin and French .\nCareer .\nBoynton graduated from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1921 . In the same year , she was hired as one of the first full-time employees at the Student Health Service . Previously , the Health Service was primarily staffed by a single employee , director Dr . Harold S . Diehl , who took her on as an assistant for three years . In her first year she treated patients during serious outbreaks of scarlet fever and influenza . She saw patients with a wide variety of diseases , including tuberculosis . Over the years , tuberculosis became a major focus of her research and publications . Boynton was Director of the Minnesota Department of Health Division of Child Hygiene from 1923 to 1927 . She also spent one year at the University of Chicago , from 1927 to 1928 , as the Chief Medical Advisor for Women and Assistant Professor of Medicine . In 1929 , she returned to the University of Minnesota for the rest of her career . When Diehl was made dean of medical science , he recommended Boynton for the job of Director . In his letter , he commented that he wasnt sure if a woman could do the job , but if there was one who could , it was Ruth Boynton . Because no woman had been in charge of a university health service before her , there was some hesitation to appoint Boynton , so she had to serve only as the acting director for a year .\nBoynton was Director of the Student Health Service from 1936 until her retirement in 1961 . During this time , she expanded it into one of the best and most complete student health services in the country . She started several new programs during her time as Director . They include a special food service for students with diseases such as diabetes , hiring health educators to promote disease prevention , and managing the use of radioactive materials on campus . She also boosted the amount of psychological and psychiatric counseling services . As Director , she served as an administrator , physician , researcher , and teacher . She also ran the U of M School of Public Health during World War II when its Director left to serve in the Army .\nDuring her career , Boynton was active in groups such as the American College Health Association . The association now awards an annual Ruth E . Boynton Award for service to the Association . She served for twenty-two years on the Minnesota State Board of Health , and was twice elected its President , in 1945 and 1951 .\nLater life .\nBoynton retired from the University in 1961 . She moved to Florida where she volunteered her time as the secretary-treasurer of the American College Health Association for several years . In 1975 , the University of Minnesota honored her career and contributions by renaming the Student Health Service to Boynton Health Service , the name it still bears . She died on December 21 , 1977 in Miami after a brief illness . Boynton gave $20,000 to establish the Prudence Catright Scholarship for an outstanding woman graduate student in education to the University of Minnesota in her bequest . To Boynton Health Service she gave $15,000 to establish a learning resources center for the staff .\nExternal links .\n- Ruth Evelyn Boynton Papers , 1931-1962",

    "story": "Declan Devine\nDeclan Devine ( born 15 September 1973 in Derry ) is an Irish football manager and former footballer who has played for and managed his hometown club Derry City in the League of Ireland Premier Division .\nPlaying career .\nDevine began his career with Ipswich Town but was unable to make the breakthrough at Portman Road and returned home . Devine then plied his trade with a number of Irish League clubs as well as Derry City and won the Ulster Young Footballer of the Year Award in 1994 when playing for Roy McCreadies Omagh Town side . Devine was capped right up to U-21 level with Northern Ireland , winning an U-21 cap in a 0–0 draw against Romania in 1994 .\nHe tasted success with Glentoran , helping them to defeat Glenavon in the Irish Cup final in the 1995–96 season . However , at the end of that season Devine moved to the Brandywell for a combined fee of £42,000 which included Liam Coyle , where he provided backup to Tony ODowd as Derry City went on to win the title . Devine was restricted to a limited number of appearances and his highest profile appearance was that in the 1997 FAI Cup final . Derry City , aiming for the double , were rocked with the news of the sudden death of the younger brother of Tony ODowd just days before the final and Devine stepped up to take his place between the sticks . They were defeated 2–0 by Shelbourne in Dalymount Park on a weekend where football very much took a back seat .\nDevine remained at the Brandywell for the start of the 1997–98 season but again found his opportunities limited and returned to Omagh Town . He was on the move again the following season and ended up with Institute , becoming one of the many players who have played for the two clubs in the Derry .\nManagerial career .\nHaving stopped playing at the end of the 2001–02 season , Devine became involved in coaching at an underage level . He returned to Derry City as the Youth Development officer in 2003 and was initially involved in the delivery of the community coaching and Football in the Community programmes which were run by the club at that time . The installation of former teammate , Gavin Dykes , as manager in 2003 meant a promotion for Devine and he took on the role of first team coach . Stephen Kenny opted to retain Devine as first team coach when he arrived at the club the following season , and the back room setup , including Paul Hegarty , guided Derry City to successive second-place finishes as well as success in the FAI Cup , League Cup and memorable European runs . Following this success , Kenny lured Devine to join him at Dunfermline Athletic when he left for East End Park and he was appointed first team coach there on 5 December 2006 . Devine described the move as a massive wrench but felt for personal reasons that he needed to move on . However , after Stephen Kennys return to Derry City in late 2007 , Devine , too followed him back to the club . He was instrumental in guiding the team to the First Division title and a third-place finish in the 2011 season .\nFollowing the departure of Stephen Kenny to Shamrock Rovers in December 2011 , Devine was appointed manager of Derry City on 6 January 2012 , beating off Willie McStay to land the post . He agreed a two-year deal along with Paul Hegarty who was appointed as his assistant manager . In his first season in charge , the club finished 5th in the league , won the FAI Cup , and were runners-up in the Setanta Sports Cup . In the wake of this success , Devine signed a one-year contract extension to keep him at the club until the end of the 2014 season . At the beginning of his second season in charge , after an opening day defeat to Sligo Rovers , Devine guided his team to a 10-match unbeaten run and top of the table until they were defeated again by Sligo in the second series of fixtures . Devine left by mutual consent at the end of the season despite having qualified for Europe and a 6-0 victory against Limerick . Prior to the 2014 League of Ireland season , Devine was linked with the assistant manager post at champions St . Patricks Athletic , however he turned this down in favour of becoming an underage coach in the Elite Performance Club NI scheme . Devine , along with former Derry City player Pascal Vaudequin , will work with youth players in the west of Northern Ireland .\nHonours .\nAs a player .\n- League of Ireland : 1\n- Derry City – 1996–97\n- Irish Cup : 1\n- Glentoran – 1995–96\n- Ulster Young Footballer of the Year\n- Omagh Town – 1994–95\nAs a manager .\n- FAI Cup\n- Derry City F.C . 2012\nManagerial statistics .\nManagerial record .\n.

Salernitana returned to Serie A in 2021 , after a break of 23 seasons , having finished second in Serie B . Previously in 2015 I Granata were promoted to Serie B , having finished first in Lega Pro Prima Divisione - Girone C .\nThe club is the legitimate heir of the former Salernitana Calcio 1919 and there is a sports continuity also with the former Salerno Calcio in the 2011–12 season which restarted from Serie D rather than from Terza Categoria due to Article 52 NOIF of FIGC .\nThe club – named Salerno Calcio – was promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione as it re-obtained the original name of U.S . Salernitana 1919 . It was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione the following season .\nHistory .\nFrom Unione Sportiva Salernitana to Salernitana Calcio 1919 .\nThe Salerno-based club was originally founded in 1919 as the Unione Sportiva Salernitana . The club was known as Società Sportiva Salernitanaudax for a time during the 1920s following a merger with Audax Salerno . In 1978 , the club was renamed Salernitana Sport . The club has spent the majority of their history at the Serie B and Serie C levels of Italian football .\nSalernitana play their home matches at Stadio Arechi .\nIn their early years , Salernitana competed in the regional Italian Football Championship . They played at this level for four seasons during the 1920s . Since that time the club returned to the top level of Italian football twice ; they played in Serie A during 1947–48 and 1998–99 .\nIn 2005 the club went bankrupt but were refounded by Antonio Lombardi , changing the name from Salernitana Sport to Salernitana Calcio 1919 .\nIn summer 2011 , it did not appeal against the exclusion by Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Società di Calcio Professionistiche ( Co.Vi.So.C ) and it is excluded by the Italian football .\nClub refoundation : from Serie D to the top flight .\nOn 21 July 2011 , following the exclusion of the original Salernitana club , Salerno mayor Vincenzo De Luca , in compliance with Article 52 of N.O.I.F. , assigned the new title to Marco Mezzaroma , brother-in-law of Lazio owner and chairman Claudio Lotito . The new club was admitted to Serie D under the denomination of Salerno Calcio .\nIn the 2011–12 season , Salernitana was immediately promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after winning Group G of Serie D .\nOn 12 July 2012 the club was renamed US Salernitana 1919 . In the 2012–13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season , Salernitana finished first in Girone B , and was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione . This was the second consecutive promotion for the team . Finally Salernitana won Group C of Lega Pro and returned Serie B in 2014–15 season .\nAfter several seasons at Serie B level , Salernitana won promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2020–21 Serie B season under the tenure of head coach Fabrizio Castori . Salernitanas promotion in Serie A will however require Lotito and Mezzaroma to sell the club , due to Italian football laws not allowing two clubs from the same owner to play in the same league .\nColours , badge and nicknames .\nSalernitana originally wore light blue and white striped shirts , known in Italy as biancocelesti . The blue on the shirt was chosen to represent the sea , Salerno the city lies right next to the Gulf of Salerno and has a long tradition as a port city .

    "story": "Pirate Party Germany\nThe Pirate Party Germany ( ) , commonly known as Pirates ( German : Piraten ) , is a political party in Germany founded in September 2006 at c-base . It states general agreement with the Swedish Piratpartiet as a party of the information society ; it is part of the international movement of pirate parties and a member of the Pirate Parties International . In 2011-12 , the party succeeded in attaining a high enough vote share to enter four state parliaments ( Berlin , North Rhine-Westphalia , Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein ) and the European Parliament . However , their popularity rapidly declined and by 2017 they had no representation in any of the German state parliaments . Their one European MEP , Patrick Breyer , has joined the Greens/EFA group . Together with Marcel Kolaja , Markéta Gregorová and Mikuláš Peksa from the Czech Pirate Party they build up the European Pirate Party team for the European Parliament in Brussels .\nAccording to political theorist Oskar Niedermayer , the party sees itself as part of an international movement to shape with their term of digital revolution which is a circumscription for the transition into information society . With their focus on freedom in the net and their fight against government regulations of this sphere , they caught the attention especially of the younger generation . Even if the network policy is the core identity of the party , it is now more than just an advocacy party of digital natives and characterises itself as a social-liberal-progressive .\nFormer federal chairman Sebastian Nerz sees the party as social-liberal party of fundamental rights which among other things wants to advocate for political transparency .\nParty platform .\nThe party supports the preservation of current civil rights in telephony and on the Internet ; in particular , it opposes the European data retention policies .\nThe party favors the civil right to information privacy and reforms of copyright , education , genetic patents and drug policy .\nIn particular , it promotes an enhanced transparency of government by implementing open source governance and providing for APIs to allow for electronic inspection and monitoring of government operations by the citizen .\nThe Pirate Party also supports an unconditional basic income for citizens and direct democracy via e-democracy .\nHistory .\nThe party was founded on 10 September 2006 . Thorsten Wirth has been the Party Leader since 30 November 2013 . Previous leaders were , Sebastian Nerz , Dirk Hillbrecht , Christof Leng , and Jens Seipenbusch .\nIn February 2009 , the village spokesperson of Hohenstein and as such city councillor in Strausberg Jens Knoblich joined the Pirate Party Germany . In June 2009 , Bundestag member Jörg Tauss left the SPD and joined the Pirate Party after the Zugangserschwerungsgesetz was passed , but left the Pirate Party in 2010 when he was convicted for possession of child pornography . In late August 2009 , Herbert Rusche , one of the founding members of the German Green Party and , in the 1980s , the first openly homosexual member of parliament in Germany , joined the Pirate Party . During the 2011 Berlin state election , the party entered a state parliament for the first time when the Berlin party chapter received 8.9 percent of the votes for the state parliament of Berlin . , the party had around 35,000 members .\nElection results .\n2009 federal election .\nOn 27 September 2009 , the Pirates received 2.0% ( 845,904 votes ) in the 2009 German federal election , thus not securing any seats in the Bundestag . However , this was still the best result among parties that did not meet the 5% threshold . Among first-time male voters , the party received 13% .\nOn account of the election results in 2009 , the party fulfils the conditions for receiving public allowances . For 2009 , it received €31,504.68 ( the same amount as it received from private contributions ) which was exclusively due to the Pirates state associations Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein . The calculation was made based on the total receipts of the party in 2008 . The possible upper limit of the public allowance matching for the party is a rate of €840,554.51 .\n2009 European Parliament election .\nIt received 229,117 votes in the 2009 European Parliament election , which was 0.9% , but not enough ( at least 5% ) for a seat .\nState and regional elections .\nOn 30 August 2009 , the Pirates received 1.9% in the 2009 Saxony state election . On the same day , the party also received one seat in each council in the local elections of Münster and Aachen , although candidates of the party ran for office only in some constituencies of both cities .\nSupport for The Pirates differs somewhat between States . The party received 1.8% in the 2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election and 1.5% in the 2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election ( though without securing seats ) , but only 0.5% in the 2009 Hesse state election and did not participate in the 2009 Brandenburg and Saarland state elections .\nThe party received 2.1% in the 2011 Hamburg state elections , though it was not yet enough to gain seats in the State parliament . In the 2011 Baden-Württemberg state election the Pirate Party was able to repeat this result . In the 2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election they received 1.4% or 13,828 votes ; in the 2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election they achieved 1.6% of the votes .\nIn the 2011 Berlin state election , with 8.9% of the votes the Pirate Party of Berlin managed for the first time to overcome the 5% threshold and to win seats ( numbering 15 out of 141 seats in the Abgeordnetenhaus ) in a German state parliament . This was quite a surprise for them , since they only had 15 candidates on the ballot . In response to their election , however , Mayor Klaus Wowereit criticized their lack of diversity , most notably the lack of women in the party .\nIn March 2012 , the Pirates received 7.4% of the vote and thus won 4 seats in the Landtag of Saarland .\nSubsequent 2012 polls have shown an increase in popularity in the Party . In May 2012 , they won 8.2% of the vote in Schleswig-Holstein , which was sufficient to enter the state parliament , gaining 6 seats . Also in May 2012 , they won 7.8% of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia , gaining 20 seats .\n2013 federal election .\nAfter those successful state elections , the party was able to score up to 13% in nationwide polls . However , after a string of scandals and internal disputes which were handled unprofessionally and picked up by the media , the party lost the trust of voters and entered a steady decline in polls .\nAs a result , in the Lower Saxony state election in January 2013 , the Pirate Party was only able to gain about 2.1% of the votes , missing the 5% threshold needed to gain actual seats in the state parliament . Six months later during the Bavaria state election of 2013 the Pirates fared similarly , receiving again only 2% of the votes . At the 2013 German federal elections the following weekend , the party suffered another major defeat where it was again only able to achieve 2.2% of the votes , leading to the resignation of party leader .\n2014 European Parliament election .\nIn the 2014 European parliament elections , the Pirate Party received 1.45% of the national vote ( 424,510 votes in total ) and returned a single Member of the European Parliament . The elected MEP , Julia Reda , joined the Greens–European Free Alliance as an independent .\n2016 Berlin state election .\nThe Berlin state election on September witnessed the collapse of support for the Pirate Party in their previous stronghold of Berlin . Their previous vote of 8.9% achieved in 2011 fell to 1.7% and the Pirate Party lost all representation in the Berlin State assembly . The poor result was compounded by the murder suicide of former Pirate Party assembly member Gerwald Claus-Brunner .\n2017 dropout from state parliaments .\nTogether with the satirical party Die PARTEI the Pirate Party nominated as candidate for the German presidential election in February 2017 .\nThe Pirate Party continued to decline in 2017 , dropping out from state parliaments . In the Saarland state election in March 2017 , the Pirate Party received only 0.7% of the voter share and therefore lost all its seats in the Landtag of the Saarland . With the North Rhine-Westphalia state election in which it lost every seat , the Pirate Party is no longer represented in any state parliament .\n2019 European Parliament election .\nIn the 2019 European Parliament election , the Pirate Party retained their MEP seat , with their lead candidate Patrick Breyer being elected .\nExternal links .\n- Junge Piraten ( youth organisation )",

Reyna last played for New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer , where he was team captain .\nEarly life .\nReynas father Miguel moved to the United States in 1968 from Argentina , where he had gone through the youth system of Independiente and played professionally with Los Andes . He settled in Springfield Township , Union County , New Jersey in the 1970s , married a Portuguese American woman , Maria Silva , and raised a family .

In 1999 , he was named by The Star-Ledger as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1990s .\nHighly recruited out of high school , Reyna elected to attend the University of Virginia from 1991 to 1993 on a full scholarship . While at Virginia , he spent three seasons on the mens soccer team , coached by future U.S . national team coach Bruce Arena . The Cavaliers won the NCAA Championship each of his three seasons . On an individual level , Reyna won the Hermann Trophy in 1993 and the MAC Award in 1992 and 1993 ; and was named the 1992 and 1993 Soccer America Player of the Year .

Reyna would remain with Rangers until December 2001 . Despite building his reputation in Germany and on the national team as a creative midfielder , he spent most of his years at Rangers playing right midfield .

In the quarterfinals , the U.S . lost to eventual runner-up Germany . He became only the third American ever ( after Bert Patenaude and John Souza ) named to the World Cup all-tournament team .\nIn 2006 , Reyna again captained the U.S . at the World Cup in Germany . Trailing 1–0 in the opener against the Czech Republic , Reyna fired a 30-yard shot that bounced off the post , the best American chance in the game . In the final group game against Ghana , Reyna suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament when he lost the ball to Haminu Draman who then dribbled in alone and scored Ghanas first goal .\nOn June 23 , 2006 , the day after the U.S . was eliminated from the World Cup , Reyna announced his retirement from the national team .

    "story": "Woolwich Ferry\nThe Woolwich Ferry is a free vehicle and pedestrian ferry across the River Thames in East London , connecting Woolwich on the south bank with North Woolwich on the north . It is licensed and financed by London River Services , the maritime arm of Transport for London ( TfL ) . The service is operated by Briggs Marine under contract to TfL and carries both foot passengers and vehicles . Around two million passengers use the ferry each year .\nA ferry has operated on the Thames at Woolwich since the 14th century , and commercial crossings operated intermittently until the mid-19th . The free service opened in 1889 after tolls were abolished on bridges to the west of London . Traffic increased in the 20th century because of the rise in motor vehicle traffic and it remained popular because of the lack of nearby bridges . Pedestrian use dropped after the construction of a parallel foot tunnel and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich Arsenal station . Alternatives such as the Thames Gateway Bridge and Gallions Reach Crossing have been proposed as replacements , but there are no plans to discontinue the Woolwich Ferry as long as there is demand .\nServices .\nThe service links Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with North Woolwich in the London Borough of Newham . It also links two ends of the inner London orbital road routes : the North Circular and the South Circular .\nOn weekdays , the ferry operates from 6.10 am until 8 pm with a two-boat service ( 10 minutes nominal interval between sailings ) ; on Saturdays , from 6.10 am to 8 pm with a one-boat service ( 15 minutes nominal interval ; the last south-to-north sailing is 15 minutes earlier at 7.45 pm ) ; on Sundays , from 11.30 am to 7.30 pm with a one-boat service ( last south-to-north sailing at 7.15 pm ) . The ferries can carry heavy goods vehicles and other road traffic across the river , up to a maximum height of and width of . The service is free for all traffic ; in 2012 Transport for London ( TfL ) estimated a subsidy cost of 76.5p per passenger .\nNearest alternative crossings .\nThe nearest alternative crossing for pedestrians is the Woolwich foot tunnel about 100 metres ( 110 yds ) to the east . A Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) station , Woolwich Arsenal on the south side of the Thames , was opened in January 2009 as the new terminus of the London City Airport branch . King George V DLR station , on the opposite side of the river , is close to the north ferry dock .\nThe nearest vehicle alternatives are the Blackwall Tunnel about upstream to the west , or the Dartford Crossing around downstream to the east . Both tunnels have height restrictions for heavy goods vehicles , and users of the Dartford Crossing incur toll charges .\nHistory .\nEarly services .\nThere has been a connection across the Thames between what is now Old Woolwich and what would later be North Woolwich since the Norman Conquest . The area was mentioned in Domesday Book as belonging to Hamon , the dapifer ( steward ) , which belong to ( pertinent in ) Woolwich ; the pertinent here refers to the portion of land north of the Thames yet also part of the county of Kent . State papers in 1308 show that a service was running between North Woolwich and Warren Lane . That year , William de Wicton sold the business to William atte Halle for £10 . The ferry was subsequently sold in 1320 for 100 silver marks .\nCross-river traffic increased following the establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671 . To enable movement of troops and supplies , the army established its own ferry in 1810 . The following year an Act of Parliament established a commercial ferry company , but it was dissolved in 1844 . In 1846 , the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch ; eventually three steam ferries operated , but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand . In October 1880 , a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service , but the cost was seen as prohibitive .\nFollowing the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works , which had taken over toll bridges in west London and opened them to free public use , it was suggested that the board should fund a free crossing of the Thames in east London . Proposals were made to provide services at Woolwich and further upstream at Greenwich , but the latter plan was abandoned . In 1884 the board agreed to provide two steam-powered ferries , each costing £10,650 , and asked chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette to lead design and construction . In September 1887 Messrs Mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at £54,900 to build approaches , bridges and pontoons .\nModern service .\nThe service was officially opened on 23 March 1889 , with the paddle steamer Gordon . Two days before the first service , the Metropolitan Board of Works was replaced by the London County Council ( LCC ) , and the opening ceremony was conducted by Lord Rosebery instead of the expected Bazalgette . The sister vessel Duncan was introduced on 20 April .\nBy the end of the 1920s , the rise in motor traffic had put pressure on the ferrys capacity . A proposed bridge between Shooters Hill and East Ham was rejected as too obvious a target for wartime bombings , and a third vessel was introduced instead . Because of the lack of a fixed crossing , the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London , who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river , including the Woolwich Ferry . The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream .\nBy the 1950s it was still quicker for ferry traffic to divert via the Blackwall Tunnel even with all three vessels operating at full capacity . In April 1963 , the paddle steamers were replaced and the ferry service upgraded to a roll-on/roll-off model , reducing waiting times on the approach roads . The LCC continued to operate the ferry until it was replaced by the Greater London Council ( GLC ) on 31 March 1965 . In 1964 , Marples Ridgway started building the current reinforced concrete terminals , which can operate over a tidal range . The current terminals were opened in 1966 .\nAfter the abolition of the GLC in 1986 , the responsibility for operating the service was transferred to the Secretary of State for Transport , who contracted the then London Borough of Greenwich to run the service . Asset ownership and operating rights were subsequently transferred to Transport for London ( TfL ) on the establishment of the Greater London Authority , but the London Borough of Greenwich continued to operate the ferry on behalf of TfL .\nIn March 2008 , the London Borough of Greenwich gave TfL notice that it would cease operating the service from 30 September 2008 . On 12 September TfL announced that the outsourcing group Serco would take over the operation of the service from 1 October 2008 ; the contract ran initially until 31 March 2010 . Control of the crossing passed from Serco to Briggs Marine , which was expanding into public passenger services , in December 2012 . The company was awarded a £50 million seven-year contract , which began in April 2013 .\nIn 2014 , TfL began an upgrade of the ferry service , starting by refurbishing the piers and in 2016 ordering two new boats to replace the existing vessels that were nearing the end of their working life . In early 2017 , it was announced that the new ferries were being built by Polish firm Remontowa to a design by LMG Marin . The diesel-electric hybrid vessels have of space for road vehicles over several lanes and dedicated cyclist accommodation . The vessels are licensed to carry 150 passengers segregated from road traffic . Continuing the tradition of naming the ferries after local people , it was announced in June 2017 that the two new vessels would be named after Dame Vera Lynn , a singer and entertainer from nearby East Ham , and Ben Woollacott , the 19-year-old deckhand on the Woolwich Ferry who drowned after being dragged overboard in a mooring accident in 2011 .\nIn October 2018 , the Woolwich Ferry was suspended for four months in order to undertake major repair work for the piers , and the existing vessels were taken out of service . The foot tunnel remained open . The ferry service resumed on 1 February 2019 .\nUpon the expiry of Briggs Marines contract in December 2020 , the service will be by London River Services .\nIncidents .\nOn 3 August 2011 , 19-year-old ferry worker Ben Woollacott died after falling off the boat into the River Thames . The MAIB report published in August 2012 blamed unseamanlike working practices during the unmooring operation for the death . When two new ships were bought to update the service in 2018 , one was named after him .\nFleet .\nThe first ferries were the side-loading paddle steamers Gordon , Duncan and Hutton , named after General Gordon of Khartoum , Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton . Each was powered by a condensing engine manufactured by John Penn and Sons of Greenwich , producing 100 nominal horsepower .\nThe initial fleet was eventually replaced , starting in 1923 with The Squire ( named after William Squires , a former mayor of Woolwich ) , and in 1930 with the Will Crooks ( Crooks was Labour MP for Woolwich , 1903–21 ) and the John Benn ( Benn was a member of the London County Council , Liberal MP for St George—which included Wapping—and grandfather of Tony Benn ) .\nThree vessels were built in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers , and were each named after prominent local politicians : James Newman ( mayor of Woolwich , 1923–25 ) , John Burns , and Ernest Bevin . These ferries featured Voith Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability . A cycloidal propeller was fitted centrally at either end , each driven by a 500bhp 6-cylinder Mirrlees Blackstone diesel engine . Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme in 2014 , showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels . These vessels ceased operation on 5 October 2018 , after which service was suspended for four months and the ferries sold for demolition .\nTwo new vessels , the Ben Woollacott and the Dame Vera Lynn , were delivered from the Remontowa shipyard in Gdańsk , Poland , to replace the previous fleet in October 2018 . The new vessels entered service on 1 February 2019 .\nPassenger numbers .\nThe ferry typically carries about two million passengers a year ; occupants of vehicles ( including drivers ) are counted as passengers . In 2012 the ferry carried around 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers weekly .\nAt all times of day , but particularly at peak hours , it is common for vehicles to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure . Various improvements have been made to the vehicle queueing arrangements over the years , especially to avoid impacting local traffic .\nFor foot passengers , bus services connect to both terminals . There is a small bus station on the north side , but some cross-river foot passengers take the foot tunnel instead . About 300 foot passengers used the ferry daily between 1983 and 1985 . Further competition arrived in 2009 with the extension to Woolwich of the Docklands Light Railway , which crosses under the river to the east of the crossing and the tunnel , and has led to a reduction in the number of foot passengers using the ferry .\nFuture .\nThe ferry service provides one of the few road crossings of the Thames east of the City of London . As long as there is a demand for a vehicle ferry it is unlikely to be discontinued , and doing so would require changing the Metropolitan Board of Works ( Various Powers ) Act 1885 .\nPlanning applications were submitted for a new bridge , the Thames Gateway Bridge , close to the Woolwich Ferry , in 2004 although the project was cancelled in 2008 . In 2012 , the Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , announced the Gallions Reach Crossing , a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead which was expected to open in 2017 . This did not occur and has been replaced with proposals for either a new bridge or tunnel in the area . TfL planning director Richard de Cani has said that the ferry will continue to operate as long as there are no alternatives , and there are no current plans to discontinue the service .\nTolls cannot be levied on the ferry without changing the 1885 Act of Parliament . However , it is possible that the service may eventually be tolled in conjunction with other projects .\nMedia appearances .\nThe Woolwich ferry has made several appearances on TV and film . The John Benn is seen being destroyed by the titular monster in the film Behemoth , the Sea Monster . A detailed scale model is used to interact with a model of the monsters head , which capsizes the ship in the Thames .",

    "story": "Charles W . Lyons\nCharles William Lyons ( January 31 , 1868 – January 31 , 1939 ) was an American Catholic priest who became the only Jesuit and likely the only educator in the United States to have served as the president of four colleges . Born in Boston , Massachusetts , he attended the local public schools before entering the wool industry . He abandoned his career in industry to enter the Society of Jesus . While a novice in Maryland , he suffered a nervous breakdown and was sent to Georgetown University as prefect . He then resumed his studies at Woodstock College , teaching intermittently at Gonzaga College in Washington , D.C . and Loyola College in Baltimore . After his ordination , he became a professor at St . Francis Xavier College in New York City and at Boston College .\nIn 1908 , Lyons became the rector of Gonzaga College , where he remained for a year before being appointed the president of Saint Josephs College in Philadelphia . While there , he had constructed a new building for the faculty , and his tenure came to an end when he became the president of Boston College in 1914 . He continued the major construction plan of his predecessor , overseeing the completion of St . Marys Hall and Alumni Field . He also dealt with the severe downturn in enrollment due to World War I . His term came to an end in 1919 , and for the next several years , he taught at Boston College , was a priest at the Church of St . Ignatius Loyola in New York , oversaw the construction of Weston College , and led retreats around the country .\nHe was finally appointed president of Georgetown University in 1923 . While he managed construction of the New North building , he was regarded as a poor leader , and his term ended in 1928 . Lyons spent his final years as a missionary , and was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania .\nEarly life and education .\nCharles William Lyons was born on January 31 , 1868 , in Boston , Massachusetts . He was one of seven children , and his brother George also became a priest . As a young boy , he moved to South Boston and became a parishioner of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul . He attended the Boston public schools , including Bigelow Grammar School , and The English High School . Upon graduating from high school , he went to work in the wool industry , where he advanced quickly . During this time , he studied Latin on his own , and joined the Young Mens Catholic Association , which was founded by the Church of the Immaculate Conception . He eventually became a member of the associations board of directors .\nJesuit formation .\nFollowing his exposure to the Jesuits at Immaculate Conception Church , Lyons joined the Society of Jesus , and his application was accepted by the provincial superior , Thomas J . Campbell . He proceeded to the Jesuit novitiate in Frederick , Maryland , on August 14 , 1890 . He found his formation at Frederick difficult , and suffered a nervous breakdown during his juniorate , which affected his eyesight . As a result , he was sent to Georgetown University , where he was appointed prefect of the young students , who were fond of him . He remained in this position for one year , before resuming his studies in Frederick . Lyons completed his juniorate in 1895 and commenced his study of philosophy at Woodstock College . There , he gained a reputation as being a good tenor singer , and he assisted with the annual plays . During this time , he was also a catechist at St . Alphonsus Church in Woodstock , Maryland .\nFollowing his philosophical studies , Lyons was sent to Gonzaga College in Washington , D.C. , were he taught chemistry to the high school students . He was then sent to Loyola College in Baltimore , Maryland in 1901 to teach grammar and mathematics . The following year , Lyons returned to Woodstock for his theological studies . At Woodstock , he was ordained a priest in 1904 . In 1906 , he returned to Georgetown as the prefect of discipline . Lyons then spent his tertianship year at St . Andrew-on-Hudson in Hyde Park , New York .\nFollowing his tertianship , Lyons was appointed a professor of philosophy and political economy at St . Francis Xavier College in New York City . He then transferred to Boston College as a professor of psychology .\nGonzaga College .\nLyons was at Boston College for only a short while , before being appointed the rector of Gonzaga College . He assumed the position on December 27 , 1908 , succeeding Joseph J . Himmel . Shortly after he took office , an earthquake struck Messina , Italy , and the school offered a solemn high requiem mass for the victims , which was celebrated by Bishop Diomede Falconio and sung by Bonaventura Cerretti . In attendance were Bishop Denis J . OConnell , Attorney General Charles Joseph Bonaparte , the Italian ambassador to the United States , Joseph Himmel , and priests from the Dominican , Franciscan , and Paulist orders . A banquet was held to honor the new president on February 10 , which was attended by Congressman William Bourke Cockran . Lyons term came to an end on July 8 , 1909 , when he was succeeded by Eugene DeL . McDonnell .\nSaint Josephs College .\nFollowing his tenure at Gonzaga College , Lyons was appointed the rector and president of Saint Josephs College in Philadelphia in July 1909 , where he succeeded Cornelius Gillespie . Upon his assumption of the presidency , he simultaneously became pastor of the Church of the Gesú . He maintained good relations with the two successive Archbishops of Philadelphia , Patrick John Ryan and Edmond Francis Prendergast throughout his term , and the Church of the Gesú prospered during this time .\nLyons oversaw the construction of a new building for the college faculty on 18th and Thompson Streets . Its ground was broken in the fall of 1910 , and the building was complete by September 1911 . Lyons presidency ended in 1914 , when he was succeeded by J . Charles Davey .\nBoston College .\nOn January 11 , 1914 , Lyons became the rector and president of Boston College . His selection was praised by many due to his experience in managing building projects . He continued the work of his predecessor , Thomas I . Gasson , to expand the colleges campus . With construction already underway , he had architects modify the plan for St . Marys Hall to add a fourth floor , as well as expand the size of the chapel to accommodate 250 people . St . Marys Hall was completed on January 4 , 1917 . A permanent athletic field was built during his term , and Lyons christened the new Alumni Field on October 30 , 1915 .\nWith respect to the curriculum , Lyons terminated the granting of graduate degrees to students in the newly established adult night education department in 1914 , upon the request of the faculty , who argued that the program would strain the faculty and facilities . The Philomatheia Club was also established , which was a group of Catholic women from Boston who would support the college . Boston College High School was physically separated from the rest of the college for the first time in 1917 , but Lyons continued as rector of both . He also began discussions to create the School of Education , which were not realized until 1919 . In 1918 , he was made a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education .\nHis presidency was largely influenced by World War I . Lyons believed that it was his duty to support President Woodrow Wilson during time of war , and he was appointed to the Military Commission of Massachusetts during 1915 and 1916 . Enrollment at the school dropped by 81% and 15 students and alumni of the school were killed in the war . Boston College hosted a unit of the Student Army Training Corps . Following the end of the war , a Reserve Officers Training Corps unit was established . Lyons term as president ended on July 20 , 1919 , and he was succeeded by William J . Devlin .\nPastoral work in New York .\nUpon the end of his presidency in 1919 , Lyons was transferred to the Church of St . Ignatius Loyola in New York City , where he did pastoral work , including leading retreats for the priests in Boston , Providence , Portland , New York , Saint Paul , and Chicago . He was also especially active in hearing confessions . After three years , Lyons returned to Boston College as a professor of metaphysics , and as the head of the department of philosophy . He also gave lectures on philosophy to various groups in Boston . He was also tasked with overseeing the construction of the Weston College .\nGeorgetown University .\nLyons was appointed the president of Georgetown University in October 1924 , succeeding John B . Creeden . Upon his appointment , he became the only Jesuit and likely the only educator in the United States to have been president of four different colleges . Lyons showed little interest in leading Georgetown , and his presidency was considered unsuccessful . The fundraising campaign begun by Creeden floundered during his presidency and ended far short of its goal . He was frequently away from the university , as he preferred to preach and lead retreats . Seeing insufficient dormitory space as the most pressing need on campus , he oversaw the construction of the New North building in 1925 , which was completed in June 1926 in the Colonial Revival style . The interior of Old North was then gutted and redesigned to house classrooms and student services . New North doubled the amount of housing on campus . He also oversaw construction of a new wing of the Georgetown University Hospital .\nLyons modernized the curriculum , introducing an alternate course of study to the classical one , and allowing majors for upperclassmen . This coincided with a significant increase in the number of students , and Lyons responded by enlarging the faculty . By 1927 , there were more lay faculty than Jesuits . As a result , the tuition increased substantially to pay for the salaries of the lay professors . Lyons was invited by Calvin Coolidge to his 1925 presidential inauguration , and sat among the cabinet . President Coolidge also appointed him to a federal commission that would plan the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill . During this time , he was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania , with the rank of commander . Lyons presidency came to an end in 1928 , and he was succeeded by W . Coleman Nevils .\nLater years .\nUpon the end of his leadership of Georgetown , Lyons joined the Jesuit mission band in Boston , with which he traveled throughout New England , New York , and Maryland for eight years . His health began to deteriorate in 1936 , so the Jesuit superiors stationed him at Weston College as the spiritual father of the theology students . He was transferred to the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Boston in July 1937 . The following year , he suffered a major heart attack , from which doctors did not expect him to recover .\nIn 1938 , having seemingly recovered , he went to Boston College High School , but proved unable to continue working . While residing there , he suffered another heart attack , and was sent to St . Margarets Hospital in Dorchester , where he died on January 31 , 1939 . He was buried in the Jesuit cemetery at the College of the Holy Cross . Lyons Hall at Boston College , which opened 1951 , was named in his honor .",

During his first spell with the Cantabrians , although he played regularly , he was not yet a regular starter , and he missed the entire 1982–83 season as well as being relegated twice .\nAfterwards , Setién represented Atlético Madrid for three years . He enjoyed a good first two seasons , but appeared rarely in his last after some spats with elusive club chairman Jesús Gil .\nSetién then moved to CD Logroñés in 1988 where , after a slow start , he was essential in helping the Riojans retain their top-tier status . The 34-year-old returned to Racing in 1992 , and scored a career-best 11 goals in the first year in his second spell as the side returned to the top flight . He played three more years with the latter , and retired in June 1996 at nearly 38 after featuring for Levante UD in the Segunda División B play-offs , which also ended in promotion .\nIn 2001 , Setién was voted by Racings fans as their best player of all time . He appeared in almost 600 official matches in nearly two decades of play , totalling 95 league goals .\nInternational .\nSetién appeared three times for Spain and was selected for the 1986 FIFA World Cup squad , but did not leave the bench during the tournament in Mexico . His debut came on 20 November 1985 in a 0–0 friendly with Austria , in Zaragoza .\nCoaching career .\nEarly career .\nSetién began working as a manager on 5 October 2001 , succeeding the dismissed Gustavo Benítez at a Racing side that had started poorly following relegation to Segunda División . He took the team from 17th to promotion as runners-up to Atlético , but left at the end of the season due to pressure and handed the reins to his former teammate Manuel Preciado .\nFor the 2003–04 campaign , Setién returned to the second division with Polideportivo Ejido . He was dismissed on 17 November , with the team in the relegation zone .\nIn 2005 , Setién was appointed assistant coach to the Russia national beach soccer team . For three months during the following year , he was in charge of Equatorial Guinea . After that he moved to another team he played for , Logroñes in division three , being relieved of his duties midway through the 2007–08 campaign .\nLugo .\nIn June 2009 , Setién became CD Lugos coach . He led the side to promotion to the second tier in his third year , a second-ever for the Galicians .\nIn the following three years they managed to stay afloat , ranking between positions 11th and 15th .\nLas Palmas .\nOn 19 October 2015 , following the dismissal of Paco Herrera , Setién became the new manager of UD Las Palmas in the top flight . He arrived with them in the relegation zone , and led them to 11th place in his first season .\nOn 18 March 2017 , Setién announced that he would leave the Canary Islands club at the end of the campaign due to disputes with the board .\nBetis .\nOn 26 May 2017 , Setién was appointed manager of Real Betis on a three-year deal . He led the team to the sixth place in his first year , with the subsequent qualification to the group stage of the UEFA Europa League .\nSetién was linked with a move to FC Barcelona in January 2019 , but it did not materialise . On 19 May , he announced that he would leave the Estadio Benito Villamarín .\nBarcelona .\nSetién signed as head coach of Barcelona on 13 January 2020 , replacing the dismissed Ernesto Valverde on a contract lasting to June 2022 .

On 14 August 2020 , they lost 8–2 to FC Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League , which was the first time in 74 years that the club had conceded eight goals in a game ; it was also the first loss by a six-goal margin since 1951 . He was officially dismissed three days later , subsequently confirming he would take legal actions as he felt the terms of his contract were not respected .\nPersonal life .\nSetiéns son , Laro , is also a footballer and a midfielder . His father-in-law José Antonio Lozano played in the Spanish second tier in the early 1960s , and all three relatives represented Racing Santander . In addition to his native Spanish , he also speaks English and Italian .\nSetién is a keen chess player with a FIDE rating of 2055 . He played matches against former world champions Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov , of which the results were not made public . He mentioned the game as an influence on his football tactics , which prioritised possession and midfield domination .\nBefore being Barcelona manager , Setién lived in , 9km west of Santander , where there are a lot of cows ; hence , he commented : Yesterday I was walking past cows in my home town ; today I was at Barcelonas training ground coaching the best players in the world , an enormous club . In April 2020 , in an interview with TV3 , he talked about winning La Liga and Champions League titles , when he said : If it can be both , better .

    "story": "Self-Portrait with Palette ( Manet )\nSelf-Portrait with Palette ( French : Autoportrait à la palette ) is an 1878–79 oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Édouard Manet . This late impressionistic work is one of his two self-portraits . Velasquezs self-portrait in Las Meninas was a particular inspiration for Manets painting which despite its allusion to the previous artists work is very modern in its focus upon the personality of the artist and loose paint handling .\nA long series of prominent collectors have owned this painting . Most recently , it sold for $29.48 million at Sothebys on 22 June 2010 .\nDescription .\nThe 83 × 67 cm ( 33 × 26 in ) painting shows a half-length portrait of the painter Édouard Manet . In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier in front of a dark background . The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket , under which is a white shirt , of which only the collar can be seen . The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin . In the right , only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip ; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes . No further accessories are shown . The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created . His pose is slightly turned to the right , so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward , left half . The painters gaze is directed forwards at the viewer .\nBecause Manet was almost certainly not left-handed , the painting is a mirror image .\nOrigin and meaning .\nAs has been established by X-ray analysis , Manet painted his Self-Portrait with Palette over a portrait in profile of his wife Suzanne Manet . In this picture she was depicted in a pose similar to that in the painting Madame Manet at the Piano ( 1868 , Musée dOrsay ) .\nThe dating of the painting goes back to Manets friend Théodore Duret , who asked Léon Leenhof , the son of Manets wife , about it after the painters death . Moreover , Manet had used the same suit jacket that he wore in Self-Portrait with Palette in the painting At Père Lathuille ( also from 1879 ) , for the depiction of the son of the restaurants owner .\nLas Meninas , in which Diego Velázquez depicted himself in a similar pose with brush and palette , is considered an important precedent for the Self-Portrait with Palette . There the painter stands almost in the background of his studio , while his models , the five-year-old Margarita Teresa of Spain and her servants , occupy the foreground . From here Manet appropriated the pose of the painter and his equipment , but as opposed to Velázquez , he makes himself the thematic center of the image . At the same time , however , he is working on a painting , but leaves its subject matter , as well as his surroundings , to the imagination of the viewer . Manet himself between 1865 and 1870 portrayed Velázquez in a studio scene in which the Spanish painter is posed similarly to his self-portrait .\nAs a practical matter painters did not and do not wear formal dress while working , as it could far too easily be ruined by oil paint . Manets depiction of himself as a painter in stylish city-going clothes has various precedents . Already Velázquez had shown himself in costly garb that would be appropriate for a courtier . In 1870 Manet had sat for the painter Henri Fantin-Latour in the painting Un atelier aux Batignolles while similarly well-dressed . His wearing of a hat indoors also has a direct precedent . Renoir had depicted Monet in 1875 , with suit , hat and all . Just as Velázquez had used his clothes to underscore his proximity to the Spanish court , Manets clothing shows his role as a stylish and successful Parisian artist , who not only in his artistic posture , but also in his appearance is quintessentially the painter of modern life , of Baudelaires description .\nThe unfinished right hand with the paintbrush is conspicuous in the painting . Victor Stoichiţă perceives this as Manets intention and interprets it thusly : because it is an act of painting that is depicted here , it turns painting around itself like a whirlwind Françoise Cachin explains it as a way of concentrating the light and the attention of the viewer upon the more important aspects of the painting . Manets wife Suzanne , however , described this painting and the Self-Portrait with Cap ( 1878–79 ) as sketches .\nPosition in the Oeuvre .\nThe Self-Portrait with Palette is the only self-portrait by Manet in which he depicted himself as an artist . He depicted himself in several other paintings , but almost always as one of many figures in a large composition . These works include Fishing ( 1860/61 ) , Music in the Tuileries ( 1862 ) , and The Ball of the Opera ( 1873 ) .\nThe full-length Self-Portrait with Cap ( 1878–79 ) is the only other pure self-portrait by Manet . The chronological proximity of the two paintings implies a direct connection between them ; accordingly , they have been considered as two stages of a work in progress . In the first painting , Self-Portrait with Palette , the act of painting itself is depicted by the blurred gestures of the painter . In the latter work , the painter is shown with the clear detachment of a viewer , rather than a creator . To Éric Darragon it appears that the painter has stepped back , to evaluate his painting .\nAfter Manets death the two pictures hung on either side of the 1877 painting Jean-Baptiste Faure in the Role of Hamlet . From this arrangement Stoichiţă concludes that the choice of this Spanish influenced painting was meant to evoke a renewed parallel to Velázquez . Another message derived from the juxtaposition is that the self-portraits could almost be read as Manet in the Role of Manet . Juliet Wilson-Bareau , however , points out that Manet probably did not intend the pictures to be so displayed , as it was Léon Leenhoff who had the pictures framed and hung them on either side of the Faure portrait .\nReception .\nThe painting was often considered to be of lesser artistic value than Manets other works . In 1926 the critic Étienne Moreau-Nélaton wrote : This work , like the other efforts of the artist , are spoiled by a certain coldness . The artists hand moves with too much fire , painting so freely here , that it is impossible for the painter to seriously focus upon himself as an object . On the other hand , Theodore Reff in 1982 emphasized the meaning of Manets decision to approach self-portraiture , which he had never before attempted , at the high point of his career . The chosen clothes , in both case stylish suits , give the impression that Manet considered himself not only a successful artist but a successful figure in society : the paintings are a record of this success .\nWilson-Bareau proposes an alternate explanation for the origin of the self-portraits . When the art historian and Manet biographer Adolphe Tabarant asked Manets stepson Léon Leenhoff about the point in time at which Manet had been stricken with Syphilis , Leenhoff gave 1879 as an answer , which would explain why Manet , who had never before in his life painted a self-portrait , had painted two within that year . It would seem that with the reality of death right before his eyes , he felt a need to come to terms with himself .\nThe nephew of the artist , Edouard Vibert ( 1867–1899 ) finished shortly before his death a series of copies of various Manet paintings for Madame Manet as mementos of the paintings that had had to be sold after the death of the artist . Around the turn of the 20th century a copy of the Self-Portrait with Palette was attested that was ascribed to Vibert .\nProvenance .\nThe Self-Portrait with Palette was not sold during Manets lifetime and after his death was held by his widow . Nor were either of the self-portraits sold in the 1884 estate sale . Manets widow does not appear to have wanted to sell them until 1897 , as Antonin Proust in a letter from May 10 of that year stated that neither Jean-Baptiste Faure nor Auguste Pellerin were interested in the paintings .\nOn 2 February 1899 , Suzanne Manet bequeathed the pictures to her sister Martina Leenhoff , probably with the intention of aiding her during financial difficulties . That year , Madame Manet and Proust renewed their efforts to sell the paintings . This time the art dealers Hermann Paechter and Ambroise Vollard expressed interest . Later that year Paechter obtained the paintings at the price of 6,000 Francs for the Self-Portrait with Cap and only 1,000 for Self-Portrait with Palette . In Théodore Durets 1902 exhibit catalog the picture is listed as the property of Pellerin .\nShortly after , the Self-Portrait with Cap went to the collection of Max Linde in Lübeck . In addition to being an art collector Linde was also an ophthalmologist , with Edvard Munch among his patients . Eventually the Norwegian artist was inspired by the Manet to paint various other full length portraits , including a 1909 portrait of his psychiatrist Daniel Jacobson , which came close to the Manet in style and feeling .\nIn May 1910 , the Self-Portrait with Palette appeared in an exhibit at the gallery of Georges Petit in Paris , where it was labeled as on loan from the widow of the Marquis Etienne de Ganay . Just a month later it was shown in an exhibit by the gallery owners Paul Durand-Ruel , Bernheim-Jeune and Paul Cassirer together with all other Manet paintings that had previously been owned by Pellerin . Pellerin had sold his collection to the dealers , with the exception of the Self-Portrait with Palette , which he had sold to Madame de Ganay immediately beforehand . Ganay owned the painting through the 1920s ; by 1931 it was in the collection of the Berlin bank president Jakob Goldschmidt . Goldschmidt immigrated to New York City in 1936 , taking his collection with him , and died there in 1955 . In 1958 the painting was bought by J . Summers for 65,000 .\nLater the collector couple John and Frances L . Loeb from New York acquired the painting for $176,800 . At the auction of the Loeb collection on 12 May 1997 the painting was sold for $18.7 million to an anonymous bidder . At that time it was the second highest price ever paid for a work by Manet . Shortly thereafter the new owner was revealed to be the Casino developer Steve Wynn , as he displayed the picture in his hotel in the Hotel Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas . In March 2005 , it was privately sold to Steven A . Cohen . The price is estimated to have been between $35 million to $40 million .\nOn 7 May 2010 , it was announced that Cohen had decided to auction the painting at Sothebys on 22 June 2010 . The price was expected to be between $30.1 and $45.2 million . These expectations were not met , however , and the painting sold for £22,441,250 ( $29.48 million ) to the New York collector Franck Giraud . The price was nevertheless a record for a Manet painting .\nReferences .\n- Charles S . Moffet : Selbstporträt mit Palette . In : Manet 1832–1883 .

    "story": "Fort McMurray\nFort McMurray ( ) is an urban service area in the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo in Alberta , Canada . It is located in northeast Alberta , in the middle of the Athabasca oil sands , surrounded by boreal forest . It has played a significant role in the development of the national petroleum industry . The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire led to the evacuation of its residents and caused widespread damage .\nFormerly a city , Fort McMurray became an urban service area when it amalgamated with Improvement District No . 143 on April 1 , 1995 , to create the Municipality of Wood Buffalo ( renamed the RM of Wood Buffalo on August 14 , 1996 ) . Despite its current official designation of urban service area , many locals , politicians and the media still refer to Fort McMurray as a city . Fort McMurray was known simply as McMurray between 1947 and 1962 .\nHistory .\nBefore the arrival of Europeans in the late 18th century , the Cree were the dominant First Nations people in the Fort McMurray area . The Athabasca oil sands were known to the locals and the surface deposits were used to waterproof their canoes . During the fur trade , the location of Fort McMurray , west of Methye Portage , was an important junction on the fur trade route from eastern Canada to the Athabasca Country . In 1778 , the first European explorer , Peter Pond , came to the region in search of furs , as the European demand for this commodity at the time was strong . Pond explored the region farther south along the Athabasca River and the Clearwater River , but chose to set up a trading post much farther north by the Athabasca River near Lake Athabasca . However , his post closed in 1788 in favour of Fort Chipewyan , now the oldest continuous settlement in Alberta .\nIn 1790 , the explorer Alexander MacKenzie made the first recorded description of the oil sands . By that time , trading between the explorers and the Cree was already occurring at the confluence of the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers . The Hudsons Bay Company and the North West Company were in fierce competition in this region . Fort McMurray was established there as a Hudsons Bay Company post by 1870 , named for the Chief Factor William McMurray . It continued to operate as a transportation stopover in the decades afterwards . The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway arrived in 1915 complementing existing steamboat service .\nThe community has played a significant role in the history of the petroleum industry in Canada . Oil exploration is known to have occurred in the early 20th century , but Fort McMurrays population remained small , no more than a few hundred people . By 1921 , there was serious interest in developing a refining plant to separate the oil from the sands . Alcan Oil Company was the first outfit to begin bulk tests at Fort McMurray . The nearby community of Waterways was established to provide a southern terminus for waterborne transportation when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached there in 1921 .\nAbasands Oil was the first company to successfully extract oil from the oil sands through hot water extraction by the 1930s , but production was very low . Fort McMurrays processing output gradually grew to over 1,100 barrels/day by World War II , and Fort McMurray was set up by the US and Canadian forces as staging ground for the Canol Project .\nFort McMurray and Waterways amalgamated as the village of McMurray ( the Fort was dropped until 1962 , when it was restored to reflect its heritage ) by 1947 , and became a town a year later . Fort McMurray was granted the status of new town so it could get more provincial funding . By 1966 , the towns population was over 2,000 .\nIn 1967 , the Great Canadian Oil Sands ( now Suncor ) plant opened and Fort McMurrays growth soon took off . More oil sands plants were opened , especially after the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis , when serious political tensions and conflicts in the Middle East triggered oil price spikes . The population of the town reached 6,847 by 1971 and climbed to 31,000 by 1981 , a year after its incorporation as a city .\nThe city continued to grow for a few years even after the oil bust caused by the 2003 collapse in world oil prices . The population peaked at almost 37,000 in 1985 , then declined to under 34,000 by 1989 . Low oil prices since the oil price collapse in 1986 slowed the oil sands production greatly , as oil extraction from the oil sands is a very expensive process and lower world prices made this uneconomical . Oil price increases since 2003 made oil extraction profitable again for around a decade , until another slump in oil prices which began in December 2014 and deepened in 2015 resulted in layoffs and postponement of projects .\nOn April 1 , 1995 , the City of Fort McMurray and Improvement District No . 143 were amalgamated to form the Municipality of Wood Buffalo . The new municipality was subsequently renamed the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo on August 14 , 1996 . As a result , Fort McMurray was no longer officially designated a city . Instead , it was designated an urban service area within a specialized municipality . The amalgamation resulted in the entire RM of Wood Buffalo being under a single government . Its municipal office is located in Fort McMurray .\nIn June 2013 , heavy rains caused the Hangingstone River to flood , causing a six-day state of emergency , a bridge collapse , the closure of highways 63 and 881 , and the evacuation of 150 people . The flooding was part of more widespread floods in southern Alberta .\nMay 2016 wildfire .\nOn May 3 , 2016 , a large wildfire burning southwest of Fort McMurray resulted in the mandatory evacuation of the community . Record-breaking temperatures , reaching , low relative humidity and strong winds contributed to the fires rapid growth in forests affected by an unusually dry and warm winter .\nUpwards of 88,000 people in the community and surrounding region were evacuated . It was Canadas largest recorded wildfire evacuation in history and third-largest recorded environmental disaster evacuation behind the 1979 Mississauga train derailment and the 1950 Red River flood .\nAbout one-fifth of homes in the community were reported to be destroyed in the fire .\nMay 2017 chlorine gas release .\nIn 2017 chlorine gas was released in Fort McMurray , after chemicals were mixed improperly at a water treatment plant . The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo was fined for the incident in 2020 .\nApril 2020 flood .\nOn April 27 , 2020 , massive ice jams along the Athabasca River resulted in a major flood . It devastated the downtown of Fort McMurray , submerging streets and ruining businesses , cars and houses , and completely wrecking a street , Manning Avenue .\nAround 13,000 people from Fort McMurray and the surrounding area were evacuated .\nGeography .\nFort McMurray is northeast of Edmonton on Highway 63 , about west of the Saskatchewan border , nestled in the boreal forest at the confluence of the Athabasca River , the Clearwater River , the Hangingstone River , and the Horse River . It sits at above sea level . Fort McMurray is the largest community in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo .\nWhite spruce , trembling aspen , balsam poplar and white birch are the most prominent native trees in and around town . Black spruce and tamarack occur in poorly drained areas and jack pine may be seen on the driest sites . European aspen , blue spruce and sand cherry are among the exotic trees occasionally seen .\nClimate .\nWith severe winters except during periods of warming chinook winds , mild to warm summers and only three months which average temperature is higher than , Fort McMurray has a borderline subarctic climate ( Köppen : Dfc ) , very slightly below to be considered a humid continental climate ( Dfb ) as May averages ; and falls into the Natural Resources Canada ( NRC ) Plant Hardiness Zone 3a .\nThe community lies at a lower elevation than most other parts of Alberta , so under the right conditions it can be a hot spot for Alberta , or even all of Canada ( as in April 1980 when its daily mean temperature of was unsurpassed by any other Canadian station ) .\nTemperatures range from an average of in January , to in July . The average annual precipitation is and falls mainly in the summer months . Average annual snowfall is , most of which falls between October and April .\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Fort McMurray was on July 18 , 1941 . The lowest temperature ever recorded was on February 1 , 1917 and December 31 , 1933 .\nNeighbourhoods .\nNeighbourhoods in Fort McMurray include Abasand Heights , Beacon Hill , Eagle Ridge , Grayling Terrace , Gregoire , Lower Townsite , Parsons Creek , Prairie Creek , Saline Creek , Stone Creek , Thickwood Heights , Dickinsfield , Timberlea , Waterways .\nDemographics .\nFederal census .\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada , Fort McMurray recorded a population of 66,573 living in 23,937 of its 28,567 total private dwellings , a change from its 2011 population of 60,555 . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016 .\nIn the 2011 Census , Fort McMurray had a population of 61,374 living in 21,729 of its 26,401 total dwellings , a 28.7% change from its 2006 population of 47,705 . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011 .\nMunicipal census .\nThe permanent population of Fort McMurray according to its 2018 municipal census is 72,056 , a change of from its 2015 municipal census permanent population of 78,382 . In addition , the 2018 municipal census counted a shadow population of 3,559 non-permanent residents for a combined population of 75,615 , while the 2015 municipal census counted 4,342 non-permanent residents for a combined population of 82,724 .\nMigration .\nFort McMurray is a multicultural community , attracting people from all corners of Canada and the world . Generally , moves to Fort McMurray have increased in the last decade . Still , Albertans make up almost half the number of migrants to Fort McMurray , followed by 17% of people originating from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador .\nEconomy .\nFort McMurray is considered the heart of one of Albertas ( and Canadas ) hubs of petroleum production , located near the Athabasca oil sands . Besides the oil sands , the economy also relies on natural gas and pipeline transport , forestry and tourism . Oil sands producers include Syncrude , Suncor Energy , Canadian Natural Resources , and CNOOC Petroleum North America ULC . Fort McMurrays growth is characteristic of a boomtown . Housing prices and rents are far higher in Fort McMurray than most such remote areas , and in 2006 , Fort McMurray had the highest prices in Alberta . The Alberta government has promised to release more Crown land for residential construction , particularly in Timberlea on the north side .\nInfrastructure .\nAir .\nThere are several airports in the area , with Fort McMurray International Airport being the largest in northern Alberta . It is serviced by Air Canada , Air Canada Express , McMurray Aviation , Northwestern Air , WestJet and WestJet Encore , with scheduled flights to Calgary , Edmonton , Fort Chipewyan , Fort Smith , and Toronto . The airport is also serviced by various oil companies with corporate and charter flights heading north to private airstrips at oil sands operations . Flights are frequently booked to capacity because of the high transient worker population and workers who commute to Fort McMurray from other parts of Canada .\nPublic transit .\nFort McMurray Transit operates in the community , with routes that extend to all subdivisions on the south side and subdivisions on the north side . Although the service concentrates on Fort McMurray it does operate to hamlets in the RM including Anzac , Janvier , Conklin and Fort McKay .\nBus .\nEbus and Red Arrow operate scheduled passenger bus services to Edmonton and other communities along Highway 63 , as well as other destinations farther south .\nHighways and roads .\nHighway 63 is the only highway between Fort McMurray and Edmonton .

    "story": "Zhu De\nZhu De ( ; also Chu Teh ; 1 December 1886 – 6 July 1976 ) was a Chinese general , military strategist , politician , revolutionary of the Chinese Communist Party . Born poor in 1886 in Sichuan , he was adopted by a wealthy uncle at age nine . His wealthy uncle provided him a superior early education that led to his admission into a military academy . After the academy , he joined a rebel army and soon became a warlord . It was after this period that he adopted communism . He ascended through the ranks of the Chinese Red Army as it closed in on securing the nation . By the time China was under Maos control , Zhu was a high-ranking official within the Chinese Communist Party . He served as commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War . In 1955 he became one of the ten marshals of the Peoples Liberation Army , of which he is regarded as one of the principal founders . Zhu remained a prominent political figure until his death in 1976 . As the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress from 1975 to 1976 , Zhu was the head of state of the Peoples Republic of China .\nLife .\nEarly life .\nZhu was born on December 1 , 1886 , to a poor tenant farmers family in Hung , a town in Yilong County , a hilly and isolated part of northern Sichuan province . Of the 15 children born to the family only eight survived . His family relocated to Sichuan during the migration from Hunan province and Guangdong province . His origins are often given as Hakka , but Agnes Smedleys biography of him says his people came from Guangdong and speaks of Hakka as merely associates of his . She also says that older generations of his family had spoken the Kwangtung dialect ( which would be close to but probably different from modern Cantonese ) and that his generation also spoke Sichuanese , a distinct regional variant of Southwest Mandarin that is unintelligible to other speakers of Standard Chinese ( Mandarin ) .\nDespite his familys poverty , by pooling resources Zhu was chosen to be sent to a regional private school in 1892 . At age nine he was adopted by his prosperous uncle , whose political influence allowed him to gain access to Yunnan Military Academy . He enrolled in a Sichuan high school around 1907 and graduated in 1908 . Subsequently , he returned to Yilongs primary school as a gym instructor . An advocate of modern science and political teaching rather than the strict classical education afforded by schools , he was dismissed from his post and entered the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming . There he joined the Beiyang Army and the Tongmenghui secret political society ( the forerunner of the Kuomintang ) .\nNationalism and warlordism .\nAt the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming , he first met Cai E ( Tsai Ao ) . He taught at the Academy after his graduation in July 1911 . Siding with the revolutionary forces after the Chinese Revolution , he joined Brig . Cai E in the October 1911 expeditionary force that marched on Qing forces in Sichuan . He served as a regimental commander in the campaign to unseat Yuan Shikai in 1915–16 . When Cai became governor of Sichuan after Yuans death in June 1916 , Zhu was made a brigade commander .\nFollowing the death of his mentor Cai E and of his first wife Xiao Jufang in 1916 , Zhu developed a severe opium habit that afflicted him for several years until 1922 , when he underwent treatment in Shanghai . His troops continued to support him , and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord . In 1920 , after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border , he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government . Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe . He first traveled to Shanghai , where he broke his opium habit and , according to historians of the Kuomintang , met Dr . Sun Yat-sen . He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922 , but was rejected for being a warlord .\nConverting to Communism .\nIn late 1922 Zhu went to Berlin , along with his partner He Zhihua . He resided in Germany until 1925 , studying at one point at Göttingen University . Here he met Zhou Enlai and was expelled from Germany for his role in a number of student protests . Around this time he joined the Chinese Communist Party ; Zhou Enlai was one of his sponsors ( having sponsors being a condition of probationary membership , the stage before actual membership ) . In July 1925 , after being expelled from Germany , he traveled to the Soviet Union to study military affairs and Marxism at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East . While in Moscow He Zhihua gave birth to his only daughter , Zhu Min . Zhu returned to China in July 1926 to unsuccessfully persuade Sichuan warlord Yang Sen to support the Northern Expedition .\nIn 1927 , following the collapse of the First United Front , Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bochengs Nanchang Uprising . Having helped orchestrate the uprising , Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang . The uprising failed to gather support , however , and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army . Under the false name of Wang Kai , Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng .\nZhu-Mao .\nZhus close affiliation with Mao Zedong began in 1928 when , with the help of Chen Yi and Lin Biao , Zhu defected from Fan Shishengs protection and marched his army of 10,000 men to Jiangxi and the Jinggang Mountains . Here Mao had formed a soviet in 1927 , and Zhu began building up his army into the Red Army , consolidating and expanding the Soviet areas of control . The meeting , which happened on the Longjiang Bridge on April 28 , 1928 , was facilitated by Mao Zetan , who was Maos brother serving under Zhu . He carried a letter to his brother Mao Zedong where Zhu stated , We must unite forces and carry out a well-defined military and agrarian policy . This development became a turning point , with the merged forces forming the Fourth Red Army , with Zhu as Military Commander and Mao as Party representative .\nZhus leadership made him a figure of immense prestige ; locals even credited him with supernatural abilities . During this time Mao and Zhu became so closely associated that to the local villagers they were known collectively as Zhu-Mao In 1929 , Zhu De and Mao Zedong were forced to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin following military pressure from Chiang Kai-shek . Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet , which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers ( 11,584 square miles ) and include some three million people . In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership . He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign ; However , he was not able to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled . Zhu helped form the 1934 break-out that began the Long March .\nRed Army leader .\nDuring the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai organized certain battles in tandem . There were few positive effects since the real power was in the hands of Bo Gu and Otto Braun . In the Zunyi Conference , Zhu supported Mao Zedongs criticisms of Bo and Braun . After the conference , Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs . In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army . When separation between the two divisions occurred , Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao , the leader of Fourth Red Army , to go south . The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province . Arriving in Yanan , Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao .\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War , he held the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army and , in 1940 , Zhu , alongside Peng Dehuai , devised and organized the Hundred Regiments Offensive . Initially , Mao supported this offensive . While a successful campaign , Mao later attributed it as the main provocation for the devastating Japanese Three Alls Policy later and used it to criticize Peng at the Lushan Conference .\nLater life .\nIn 1949 Zhu was named Commander-in-Chief of the Peoples Liberation Army ( PLA ) . He also served as the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party ( 1956–1966 ) and Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Republic of China ( 1954–1959 ) . Zhu oversaw the PLA during the Korean War within his authority as Commander-in-Chief . In 1955 , he was conferred to the rank of marshal . At the Lushan Conference , he tried to protect Peng Dehuai , by giving some mild criticisms of Peng ; rather than denouncing him , he merely gently reproofed his targeted comrade , who was a target of Mao Zedong . Mao wasnt satisfied with Zhu Des behavior . After the conference , Zhu was dismissed from vice chairmen of Central Military Commission , not in least part due to his loyalty for the fallen Peng .\nIn April 1969 , during the summit of the Cultural Revolution , Zhu was dismissed from his position on the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China , and the activity of the National Peoples Congress was halted . In August 1969 , Lin Biao issued a command that dispatched important martial figures to distant areas due to the tension between China and Soviet Union , and Zhu De was driven to Guangzhou . In 1973 Zhu was reinstated in the Standing Committee .\nHe continued to work as a statesman until his death on 6 July 1976 . His passing came six months after the death of Zhou Enlai , and just two months before the death of Mao Zedong . Zhu was cremated three days later , and received a funeral days afterwards .\nPersonal life .\nMarriage .\nZhu De married four times , according to the unfinished biography written by Agnes Smedley . However , there is no evidence of his marrying the mother of his only daughter . His known relationships were with :\n- Xiao Jufang ( or Hsiao Chu-fen ) . Xiao was a fellow student of Zhus at Kunming Normal Institute ( ) . The pair married in 1912 . Xiao died of a fever in 1916 after giving birth to Zhus only son , Baozhu .\n- Chen Yuzhen ( ) . After the death of Xiao Jufang , Zhu was advised to find a mother for his infant son . He was introduced to Chen by friends in the military . Chen had participated in revolutionary activities in 1911 , as well as in 1916 . Chen reportedly set the condition that she would not marry unless her future husband proposed to her in person , which Zhu did . The two married in 1916 . Chen looked after the home , even building a study for Zhu and his scholarly friends to meet , which she furnished with pamphlets , books , and manifestos on the Russian October Revolution . In the spring of 1922 , Zhu left his home to visit the Sichuanese warlord Yang Sen . According to Agnes Smedleys biography , Zhu considered himself separated from Chen after leaving her and felt free to marry again , though there had been no formal divorce . Chen was killed by the Kuomintang in 1935 .\n- He Zhihua ( ) . He met Zhu in Shanghai and followed him to Germany in late 1922 . When Zhu was deported from Germany in 1925 , she was already pregnant and later gave birth in a village on the outskirts of Moscow . Zhu named the daughter Sixun ( ) , but relations between He and Zhu had diminished and she rejected his choice , naming the baby Feifei ( ) . He sent her daughter to live with her sister in Chengdu shortly after the birth . She then married Huo Jiaxin ( ) in the same year . He returned to Shanghai in 1928 . She reportedly betrayed wanted communists to the Kuomintang , before being blinded in a gun attack by Red Army soldiers that killed her husband . After this , she returned to Sichuan , dying of illness before 1949 .\n- Wu Ruolan ( or Wu Yu-lan ) . Wu was the daughter of an Intellectual from Jiuyantang ( ) in Hunan . Zhu met Wu after attacking Leiyang with the Peasants and Workers Army . They married in 1928 . In January 1929 , Zhu and Wu were encircled by Kuomintang troops at a temple in the Jinggang Mountains . Zhu escaped , but Wu was captured . She was executed by decapitation and her head was allegedly sent to Changsha for display .\n- Kang Keqing ( Kang Ke-ching or Kang Keh-chin ) . Zhu married Kang in 1929 when he was 43 . She was a member of the Red Army and also a peasant leader . Kang was highly studious and Zhu taught her to read and write before they married . Kang outlived him . Unlike most women who joined the Long March , she did not become part of the propaganda unit marching at the rear . Kang fought by the side of her husband , distinguishing herself as a combat soldier , a markswoman , and a troop leader .\nChildren .\n- Zhu Baozhu ( ) was born in 1916 and later changed his name to Zhu Qi ( ) . He died in 1974 from illness .\n- Zhu Min ( ) was born in Moscow in April 1926 to He Zhihua ( ) . Zhu De named her Sixun ( ) , but she rejected this and choose Feifei ( ) . He Zhihua sent her daughter to her sister in Chengdu shortly after her birth , where she went by the name He Feifei ( ) . She pursued higher education in Moscow from 1949 to 1953 before teaching at Beijing Normal University . She died of illness in 2009 .\nAwards .\n- Chinese Soviet Republic",

    "story": "ACES Colombia\nACES ( Spanish acronym : Aerolíneas Centrales de Colombia ) was an airline with its headquarters in the Edificio del Cafe in Medellín , Colombia and founded on August 30 , 1971 , by a group of 13 Colombian entrepreneurs , amongst them , most notably Orlando Botero Escobar and German Peñaloza Arias from Manizales and Luis H . Coulson , Jorge Coulson R. , Alberto Jaramillo and Hernán Zuluaga from Medellín .\nHistory .\nMr . Botero and Mr . Peñaloza , were considered pioneers in the early days of Colombian commercial aviation , had tried several times to establish a commuter service between Manizales and Bogotá . They managed to operate a small commuter airline by the name TARCA ( acronym of Taxi Aéreo de Caldas ) , which was forced to shut down due to financial difficulties . With the support and capital of the new partners from Medellín , they embarked on the successful enterprise that would be ACES . The airline began service in 1972 with Saunders ST-27 aircraft for the routes Medellín-Bogotá and Manizales-Bogotá , and soon became a major player in the Colombian market . By 1976 , the airline had expanded its network to smaller regional destinations , for which it purchased DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft .\nIn 1981 , it acquired its first Boeing 727-100 . In 1986 , an expansion began with the acquisition of more 727-100 and the arrival of Fairchild FH-227 aircraft built under license by Fairchild in the United States and with slight modifications . The 727s had a capacity of 129 passengers and the Fairchilds of 44 . At this time the first international charter flights also began to Havana , Varadero , Nassau , Freeport , Montego Bay , Puerto Plata , Punta Cana , St . Kitts , St . Maarten , Porlamar and Cancun .\nIn 1991 , ACES completely replaced its Fokker F27 Friendship fleet with ATR 42 turbo-prop aircraft for its short-haul regional routes , and its Boeing 727-100 with the Boeing 727-200 Advanced variant . In 1992 , ACES expanded its service internationally , operating flights from Medellín and Bogotá to Miami . Soon after , Juan Emilio Posada was appointed CEO and would serve until the airlines demise in 2003 . In the late 1997 , ACES modernized its fleet acquiring brand-new Airbus A320-200 aircraft that replaced its Boeing 727s . It expanded its routes to Fort Lauderdale , Quito , Caracas , Cancún ( served by charters ) , Santo Domingo , Punta Cana and San Juan , Puerto Rico ; as well as additional domestic flights within Colombia .\nACES created a corporate culture of service and punctuality that would earn it the recognition and loyalty of its customers , resulting in consistent increases in its market share and revenues in the domestic market , which was dominated for decades by Avianca . It was named the Best airline in Colombia by several industry and consumer publications .\nOn May 20 , 2002 , ACES merged with major competitor Avianca and SAM to form the Alianza Summa , a strategic alliance aimed at joining forces to counteract the adverse circumstances that faced the airline industry in Colombia and the world after the September 11 attacks . ACES operations were halted on August 20 , 2003 , after the boards decision to liquidate the airline . ACES ceased operations on October 24 , 2003 after liquidating . By November 2003 , the Summa Alliance was dissolved and ACES routes taken over by Avianca .\nFleet .\nFinal fleet .\nSince August 2003 , ACES Colombia had only been using these aircraft :\nFormer fleet .\nACES Colombia had in the past operated a variety of aircraft , including :\nAccidents and incidents .\n- On December 18 , 1981 , a DHC-6 Twin Otter ( registered HK-2216 ) crashed in the municipality of San Antero , during the approach to the Coveñas Airport . In this incident 13 people perished , including the crew composed of Captain Guillermo Alberto García and co-pilot Andrés Rafael Londoño .\n- On November 29 , 1982 , a DHC-6 Twin Otter ( registered HK-2536 ) crashed in the foothills of the Eastern Cordillera against Cerro Pan de Azúcar in the township of San Juanito , Meta . The flight came on a regular flight from San José del Guaviare and was heading to Bogotá under the command of Captain Marino Jiménez and co-pilot Ricardo Santacoloma , who along with 20 passengers lost their lives .\n- On August 1 , 1988 , a DHC-6 Twin Otter ( registered HK-2445 ) was hijacked and demanded the pilot to land at an abandoned airstrip in Colombia . The passengers were reportedly robbed and the hijackers escaped , which six of them were later captured .\n- On November 30 , 1996 , a DHC-6 Twin Otter , operating flight 148 , ( registered HK-2602 ) crashed into Cerro El Barcino a few minutes after takeoff from Olaya Herrera Airport . The flight was operating the route between Medellin , Bahía Solano and Quibdó . 14 people died in the impact and subsequent fire , including the crew commanded by Captain Juan Carlos Bermúdez López ; one passenger survived with serious injuries .\n- On October 11 , 2000 , an ATR 42-500 ( registered VP-BOF ) and a Boeing 727-200 ( registered HK-3998X ) collided on the El Dorado International Airport apron during the towing process .

    "story": "Karl Lueger\nKarl Lueger ( ; 24 October 1844 – 10 March 1910 ) was an Austrian politician , mayor of Vienna , and leader and founder of the Austrian Christian Social Party . He is credited with the transformation of the city of Vienna into a modern city . The populist and antisemitic politics of his Christian Social Party are sometimes viewed as a model for Adolf Hitlers Nazism .\nLife and early career .\nKarl Lueger came from a modest background , born at Wieden ( since 1850 the 4th district of Vienna ) to Leopold Lueger of Neustadtl an der Donau and his wife Juliane . His birthplace is now the western part of the main building of the Vienna University of Technology at Karlsplatz where Luegers father worked as an usher at the Vienna Polytechnic .\nHe nevertheless was able to attend the renowned Theresianum boarding school ( Theresianische Ritterakademie ) as a day student . He studied law at the University of Vienna , receiving his doctorate in 1870 . While at the university he was a member of the Catholic Student Association ( Katholische akademische Verbindung Norica Wien , K.A.V . Norica Wien ) , part of the Österreichische Cartellverband ( ÖCV ) fraternities .\nHe established his own lawyers office in Vienna in 1874 and soon became known as a little peoples ( „kleinen Leute“ ) advocate . In this his role model and mentor was the popular Jewish physician and local politician Ignaz Mandl , known as God of the Little People in Luegers district of Landstraße ( Third District ) , whom he followed into political life . The association ended when Lueger became identified with antisemitism .\nPolitical career .\nLueger played a part in many political spheres , including Vienna City Council where he eventually became mayor , the federal Austrian parliament , and the state parliament of Lower Austria .\nViennese municipal politics .\nIn 1875 , he was elected to Viennas City Council ( Gemeinderat ) , initially as a liberal . He would serve on the council until his death , save for a two-year break from 1876 to 1878 . He campaigned against the government of liberal mayor Cajetan Felder and achieved popularity as a campaigner against corruption .\nIn 1888 he brought together the German National ( Deutschnationale ) and Christian Social factions at City Hall to form a group that later became known as the United Christians ( Vereinigte Christen ) .\nAfter the 1895 elections for the Vienna Gemeinderat , the Christian Socials won two thirds of the seats , ending the long Liberal rule . The Christian Social supermajority subsequently elected Lueger as mayor . However , during imperial times , mayors had to be confirmed in office by Emperor Franz Joseph . The emperor allegedly loathed Lueger as a person and considered him a dangerous revolutionary . He was also concerned about Luegers antisemitism . With the support of Prime Minister Kasimir Felix Badeni , Franz Joseph refused to confirm Lueger as mayor . The Christian Socials retained a large majority in the council , and reelected Lueger as mayor three more times , only to have Franz Joseph refuse to confirm him each time . He was elected mayor for a fifth time in 1897 , and after a personal intercession by Pope Leo XIII , his election was finally sanctioned later that year .\nHe was a zealous Catholic and wished to “capture the university” for the Church . He would have neither Social Democrats nor Pan-Germans nor Jews in the municipal administration . He secured good treatment for Czech immigrants .\nHe planned to make Vienna one of the most beautiful of garden cities .\nIn his incumbency , Lueger is credited with the extension of the public water supply by its second main aquifer ( Hochquellwasserleitung ) , which provides tap water of mineral-water quality to large parts of the city . He also pursued the municipalization of gas and electricity works as well as the establishment of a public transport system , introducing streetcars , and of numerous institutions of social welfare , most of which strongly relied on debt financing . He incorporated the suburbs , and built parks , gardens , hospitals , and schools .\nDer schöne Karl ( handsome Karl ) achieved tremendous popularity among the citizens . During his tenure , Vienna ultimately changed its appearance as the capital of a great power of the pre-World War I era—a heritage that remained even in Red Vienna after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918 . A significant part of the infrastructure and organisations that are responsible for the high standard of living in the contemporary city were created during his terms of office .\nLueger served as mayor of Vienna until his early death from diabetes mellitus in 1910 . He was buried in the crypt of the newly erected St . Charles Borromeo Church at the Zentralfriedhof ( also called Dr . Karl Lueger Memorial Church ) , whose groundbreaking ceremony he had performed .\nChristian Social movement .\nLuegers early political life was associated with Georg von Schönerer and the German National Party , which was antisemitic . From the late 1880s onwards Lueger was a regular attendee at the influential circles of clerical social conservative politicians around Karl von Vogelsang , Prince Aloys Franz de Paula Maria of Liechtenstein , and the theologian Franz Martin Schindler . In view of the rising labour movement , the participants on the basis of Catholic social teaching developed ideas to overcome social polarisation by several measures of social security legislation and the common Catholic faith . Moreover , after an 1882 electoral reform had expanded the electorate suffrage , Lueger focussed on petty bourgeois tradespersons , who assumed the Jewish competition to be the underlying cause of their precarious situation , and discovered that raising the Jewish Question earned him enormous popularity .\nIn 1885 he was elected to the lower house ( Abgeordnetenhaus ) of the Austrian Imperial Parliament ( Reichsrat ) , representig the Fifth District of Vienna , and was returned in the 1891 election . From 1890 he was also a member of the Lower Austria parliament ( Landtag ) .\nLueger , Prince Liechtenstein , Vogelsang and Schindler met regularly at the Hotel Zur goldenen Ente ( Golden Duck , Riemergasse 4 ) in Viennas First District , and would refer to their meetings as Enten-Abende ( Duck Evenings ) . This working group became the focus for social reform , and they organised the Second Austrian Katholikentag in 1889 . From this Schindler developed the platform of the fledgling Christian Social Party ( Christlichsoziale Partei , CS ) . Lueger was to found and lead the party in 1893 , which quickly rivaled the Social Democrats ( Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs , SPÖ ) . He remained one of its most effective leaders till his death and developed his partys federation policy as a means of dealing with the monarchys issues of multiple nationalities .\nMuch of Luegers popularity stemmed from his appeal to women ; his female followers were variously known as Luegers Amazons , the Lueger Garde or Lueger Gretls and were organised in the Christian Social Womens League . Although women could not vote , he calculated that they could significantly influence how their menfolk voted , and they also inculcated the party ideology in their children . To maintain his female following , Lueger remained a bachelor and publicly disavowed any private life , claiming that he was too busy because he belonged totally to my Viennese . After his death there was a scandal when his long-time mistress , Marianne Beskiba , published a tell-all memoir including facsimiles of love letters from him ; the book provides useful information about his political tactics and how the party was run .\nAntisemitism .\nLueger was known for his antisemitic rhetoric and referred to himself as an admirer of Edouard Drumont , who founded the Antisemitic League of France in 1889 . Decades later , Adolf Hitler , an inhabitant of Vienna from 1907 to 1913 , saw him as an inspiration for his own views on Jews . Though not an explicit pan-Germanist , Lueger advocated racist policies against non-German speaking minorities in Austria-Hungary and in 1887 voted for a bill proposed by his long-time opponent Georg von Schönerer to restrict the immigration of Russian and Romanian Jews . He also overtly supported the völkisch movement of Guido von List and created the pun Judapest , referring to supposed Jewish domination of the Hungarian capital , Budapest . The historian Léon Poliakov wrote in The History of Anti-Semitism :\nIt soon became apparent that especially in Vienna any political group that wanted to appeal to the artisans had no chance of success without an anti-Semitic platform . [ ... ] It was at that time that a well-known phrase was coined in Vienna : Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools . The situation was exploited by the Catholic politician Karl Lueger , the leader of Austrian Christian-Social party with a program identical to that of the Berlin party of the same name led by Pastor Stoeker . In 1887 , Lueger raised the banner of anti-Semitism . [ ... ] However , the enthusiastic tribute that Hitler paid him in Mein Kampf does not seem justified , for the Jews did not suffer under his administration .\nOther observers contend that Luegers public racism was in large part a pose to obtain votes , being one of the first who made use of populism as a political tool . Historian William L . Shirer wrote that his opponents , including the Jews , readily conceded that he was at heart a decent , chivalrous , generous and tolerant man .\nAccording to Amos Elon , Luegers anti-Semitism was of a homespun , flexible variety—one might almost say gemütlich . Asked to explain the fact that many of his friends were Jews , Lueger famously replied , I decide who is a Jew . Viennese Jewish writer Stefan Zweig , who grew up in Vienna during Luegers term of office , recalled that His city administration was perfectly just and even typically democratic .\nGerman nationalism .\nLueger expressed some scepticism about German nationalism , but as with his antisemitism was quick to exploit the sentiments for his own political purposes . He opposed Austro-Hungarian dualism in favour of federalism and the equality of all the nations making up the empire .\nFurther influences .\nHis general style of politics later inspired some of the right-wing leaders of the First Austrian Republic in 1918–1933 , such as Ignaz Seipel , Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg , who led the Austrian society towards Austrofascism . Unlike Hitler , he did not so much inspire antisemitism in them ( none of these three were particularly antisemitic ) , but rather provided one important role model for their generally combative , unrelenting stance towards ideological political opponents , which ultimately proved to be detrimental to the cohesion of the Austrian state .\nIn Vienna , Lueger has a square named after him , at least two statues were erected in his honour , and until April 2012 a section of the Ringstraße bore his name . It has been very difficult to decide what to do with monuments honouring historical figures whose reputation has been widely called into question as Europeans ( and others ) reflect on the historical background to the holocaust . With the Anschluss of Austria in 1938 street names carrying Jewish names or the names of pacifists were changed . After World War II , Austria started a full-scale program of de-Nazification on both cultural and topographical levels . Nazified street signs were torn down and their names changed back from Nazi to Habsburg heroes .\nLuegers monuments present a difficult case because they are genuinely local , yet he was inspirational for the Nazis .\nFor some , the Lueger monuments show that Vienna has neglected its obligations to the victims of the Holocaust in order to keep its nostalgic appeal as the grand Imperial City . For example , when Austrian-born neurobiologist Eric Kandel won the Nobel Prize in 2000 , he stuck it to the Austrians by saying it was certainly not an Austrian Nobel ; it was a Jewish-American Nobel . He was subsequently telephoned by the Austrian president Thomas Klestil who asked him , How can we put things right ? Kandel said that first , Dr.-Karl-Lueger-Ring should be renamed . Kandel was offended that the address of the University of Vienna is on that street .\nAfter yearlong debates , the Ring was renamed to Universitätsring in April 2012 . The monument to Lueger at Dr . Karl Lueger Platz at the Stubenring as well as the memorial plaque at the TU Wien have since been contextualized by descriptions highlighting Luegers antisemitism and his influence on National Socialism .\nLueger was the subject of a 1943 biopic Vienna 1910 , in which he was played by Rudolf Forster .\nExternal links .\n- Photo of monument Dr .

He is widely credited with the identification and development of the lithium-ion battery , for developing the Goodenough–Kanamori rules in determining the sign of the magnetic superexchange in materials , and for seminal developments in computer random-access memory .\nGoodenough was born in Jena , Germany , to American parents . During and after graduating from Yale University , Goodenough served as a U.S . military meteorologist in World War II . He went on to obtain his Ph.D . in physics at the University of Chicago , became a researcher at MIT Lincoln Laboratory , and later the head of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford . Since 1986 , he has been a professor in the school of engineering at UT Austin .\nHe has been awarded the National Medal of Science , the Copley Medal , the Fermi Award , the Draper Prize , and the Japan Prize . The John B Goodenough Award in materials science is named for him . In 2019 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside M . Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino , and , at 97 years old , became the oldest Nobel laureate in history .\nEarly life and education .\nJohn Goodenough was born in Jena , Germany , to American parents , Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough ( 1893–1965 ) and Helen Miriam ( Lewis ) Goodenough . His father was working on his Ph.D . at the Harvard Divinity School at the time of Johns birth and later became a professor in the history of religion at Yale University . Johns brother , the late Ward Goodenough , was a University of Pennsylvania anthropologist . The brothers attended boarding school at Groton in Massachusetts . In 1944 , John Goodenough received a B.S . in Mathematics , summa cum laude from Yale University , where he was a member of Skull and Bones .\nAfter serving in the US Army as a meteorologist in World War II , Goodenough went to the University of Chicago to complete a masters and was awarded a Ph.D . in physics in 1952 . His doctoral supervisor was electrical breakdown theorist Clarence Zener and he worked and studied with physicists , including Enrico Fermi and John A . Simpson . While at Chicago , he met and married history graduate student Irene Wiseman .\nCareer and research .\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory .\nAfter his studies , Goodenough was a research scientist and team leader at MITs Lincoln Laboratory for 24 years . During this time he was part of an interdisciplinary team responsible for developing random access magnetic memory . His research efforts on RAM led him to develop the concepts of cooperative orbital ordering , also known as a cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion , in oxide materials , and subsequently led to his developing the rules for the sign of the magnetic superexchange in materials , now known as the Goodenough–Kanamori rules ( with ) . .\nTenure at the University of Oxford .\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s , he continued his career as head of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at University of Oxford . Among his work at Oxford , Goodenough has been credited with significant research essential to the development of commercial lithium-ion rechargeable batteries . Goodenough was able to expand upon previous work from M . Stanley Whittingham on battery materials , and found in 1980 that by using LiCoO as a lightweight , high energy density cathode material , he could double the capacity of lithium-ion batteries . Goodenoughs work was commercialized through Sony by Akira Yoshino , who had contributed additional improvements to the battery construction . Goodenough received the Japan Prize in 2001 for his discoveries of the materials critical to the development of lightweight high energy density rechargeable lithium batteries , and he , Whittingham , and Yoshino shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their research in lithium-ion batteries .\nProfessor at University of Texas .\nSince 1986 , Goodenough has been a Professor at The University of Texas at Austin in the Cockrell School of Engineering departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering . During his tenure there , he has continued his research on ionic conducting solids and electrochemical devices ; he stated that he continued to study improved materials for batteries to help promote the development of electric vehicles and help reduce the dependency on fossil fuels . Arumugam Manthiram and Goodenough discovered the polyanion class of cathodes . They showed that positive electrodes containing polyanions , e.g. , sulfates , produce higher voltages than oxides due to the inductive effect of the polyanion . The polyanion class includes materials such as lithium-iron phosphates that are used for smaller devices like power tools . His group has also identified various promising electrode and electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells . He currently holds the Virginia H . Cockrell Centennial Chair in Engineering .\nGoodenough still works at the university at age 98 as of 2021 , hoping to find another breakthrough in battery technology .\nOn February 28 , 2017 Goodenough and his team at the University of Texas published a paper in the journal Energy and Environmental Science on their demonstration of a glass battery , a low-cost all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long cycle life with a high volumetric energy density , and fast rates of charge and discharge . Instead of liquid electrolytes , the battery uses glass electrolytes that enable the use of an alkali-metal anode without the formation of dendrites . However , this paper was met with widespread skepticism by the battery research community and remains controversial after several follow-up works . The work was criticized for a lack of comprehensive data , spurious interpretations of the data obtained , and that the proposed mechanism of battery operation would violate the first law of thermodynamics .\nIn April 2020 , a patent was filed for the glass battery on behalf of the LNEG ( National Laboratory of Energy and Geology ) in Portugal , the University of Porto , Portugal and the University of Texas .\nAdvisory work .\nIn 2010 , Goodenough joined the technical advisory board of Irvine , California-based Enevate , a silicon-dominant Li-ion battery technology startup . Goodenough also currently serves as an adviser to the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research ( JCESR ) , a collaboration led by Argonne National Laboratory and funded by the Department of Energy . Since 2016 Goodenough has also worked as an adviser for Battery500 , a national consortium led by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) and partially funded by the Department of Energy .\nFundamental investigations .\nOn the fundamental side , his research has focused on magnetism and on the Metal–insulator transition behavior in transition-metal oxides . Along with Junjiro Kanamori , Goodenough developed a set of semi-empirical rules to predict magnetism in these materials in the 1950s and 1960s , now called the Goodenough–Kanamori rules , forming the basis of superexchange , which is a core property for high-temperature superconductivity .\nDistinctions .\nProfessor Goodenough is a member of the National Academy of Engineering , the National Academy of Sciences , French Academy of Sciences , the Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas , Físicas y Naturales of Spain , and the National Academy of Sciences , India . He has authored more than 550 articles , 85 book chapters and reviews , and five books , including two seminal works , Magnetism and the Chemical Bond ( 1963 ) and Les oxydes des metaux de transition ( 1973 ) . Goodenough was a co-recipient of the 2009 Enrico Fermi Award for his work in lithium-ion batteries , alongside Siegfried S . Hecker of Stanford University who had received the award for his work in plutonium metallurgy .\nIn 2010 he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society . On February 1 , 2013 , Goodenough was presented with the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama of the United States . He was awarded the Draper Prize in engineering . In 2015 he was listed along with M Stanley Whittingham , for pioneering research leading to the development of the lithium-ion battery on a list of Clarivate Citation Laureates for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry by Thomson Reuters . In 2017 he received the Welch Award in Chemistry and in 2019 he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society .\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry granted a John B Goodenough Award in his honor .\nGoodenough received an honorary C.K . Prahalad award from Corporate EcoForum ( CEF ) in 2017 . CEFs founder Rangaswami commented , John Goodenough is evidence of imagination being put to work for the greater good . Were thrilled to recognize his lifetime of achievements and are hopeful that his latest discovery will have major implications for the future of sustainable battery storage .\nGoodenough was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on October 9 , 2019 , for his work on lithium-ion batteries , along with M . Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino . He is the oldest person to be awarded the Nobel Prize .\nWorks .\nArticles .\n- Lightfoot , P. ; Pei , S . Y. ; Jorgensen , J .

    "story": "Stefano Pioli\nStefano Pioli ( ; born 20 October 1965 ) is an Italian football manager and a former footballer who played as a defender . He is the head coach at Serie A club A.C . Milan .\nPlaying career .\nPioli , a native of Parma , started his own playing career for his home city team , Parma . Successively , he was signed by Juventus , with whom he made his Serie A debut in 1984 , winning the league title , the European Cup , the European Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup during his three seasons with the club . After being sold to Hellas Verona in 1987 , Pioli moved to Fiorentina in 1989 , where he spent six years of his career , before spending two seasons with Padova . After successive season-long spells in Serie C with Pistoiese and Fiorenzuola , he ended his career in 1999 with Colorno of Eccellenza Emilia-Romagna ( the sixth-highest level of Italian football at that time ; the top level of the Emilia-Romagna regional league system ) , playing alongside his brother Leonardo .\nStyle of play .\nAn elegant , tenacious , physical , and mobile defender , Pioli was capable of playing anywhere along the back-line , although he performed best as a man-marking centre-back , or stopper , in Italian . Considered to be a promising and consistent player in his youth , his career was affected by numerous serious injuries .\nCoaching career .\nEarly career .\nFrom 1999 to 2002 Pioli coached Bolognas youth team ( winning a championship with Allievi Nazionalis team ) , and Chievos in 2002–03 . In 2003–04 , he was appointed as head coach of Serie B club Salernitana . He moved to Modena , still of Serie B , in 2004 .\nIn 2006 , Pioli was named as Parmas head coach , therefore returning to his home city and marking his Serie A debut as a manager . However , he was sacked on 12 February 2007 after a 3–0 loss to Roma which brought Parma down to second-last place and replaced by Claudio Ranieri .\nOn 11 September 2007 , Pioli was unveiled as new head coach of Serie B club Grosseto , replacing Giorgio Roselli , who was sacked after three consecutive defeats in the first three league matches , and managed to lead the Tuscan minnows to an impressive mid-table finish in their first season in the Serie B . He then served as head coach of Piacenza for their 2008–09 Serie B campaign . In July 2009 , he left Piacenza to join Sassuolo as new head coach of the neroverdi .\nChievo .\nOn 10 June 2010 , Pioli was named head coach of Serie A club Chievo on a 12-month contract .\nPalermo .\nOn 2 June 2011 , Pioli was named head coach of Serie A club Palermo , but he was relieved of his duties just 90 days later .\nBologna .\nOn 4 October 2011 , Pioli was named new head coach of Bologna in Serie A , replacing the sacked Pierpaolo Bisoli . After two troublesome seasons with Bologna , both ended with the team struggling in the bottom half of the Serie A table but always escaping relegation , he was removed from his managerial duties on 8 January 2014 , with Davide Ballardini appointed as his replacement .\nLazio .\nOn 12 June 2014 , it was confirmed Piolis appointment as new head coach of Lazio in place of Edoardo Reja . In his first season at the club , he led Lazio to a third-place Serie A finish . On 11 June 2015 , he was offered a new 2-year contract with an additional year option .\nOn 3 April 2016 , Pioli was sacked after a 4–1 home defeat to city rivals Roma .\nInternazionale .\nOn 8 November 2016 , Pioli was appointed as the new head coach of Internazionale on an 18-month contract . On 20 November , Inter drew 2–2 against Milan in a Serie A Derby della Madonnina match , Piolis first competitive match as head coach of the club . He was sacked on 9 May 2017 . Inter had won 12 of the first 16 Serie A matches that Pioli was in charge of ( draw with Milan , losses to Napoli , Juventus and Roma ) , but this was followed by two draws and five losses in their last seven Serie A matches prior to his sacking .\nFiorentina .\nOn 6 June 2017 , Pioli was named new head coach of Fiorentina . He signed for two years with another optional year . Pioli was in charge of the team when on 4 March 2018 central defender and captain Davide Astori died unexpectedly ; to honor the memory of the player , Pioli got a commemorative tattoo . On 9 April 2019 , Pioli resigned as manager .\nMilan .\nOn 9 October 2019 , Pioli was appointed as the new coach of Milan , on a deal to the end of the season . On 21 July 2020 , Pioli reached an agreement with Milan for a two-year deal extension of his contract as head coach that will now expire in June 2022 . On 23 May 2021 , he secured a return to the Champions League for Milan for the first time in seven seasons .\nStyle of management .\nPioli usually uses a 4–2–3–1 formation , or a 3–5–2 formation , with full-backs or wing-backs who actively take part in the teams attacking plays . During his time at Lazio , he often used a 4–3–3 formation . Due to his passion for basketball , he attempted to bring strategic elements of the sport into his own tactical approach as a football manager .\nAs a head coach of A.C . Milan , Pioli made use of an archaic WM formation , also known as 3–2–2–3 . Although presented officially as a 4–3–3 , the formation featured the left full-back , Theo Hernandez , in a more advanced position , whereas the right full-back , Davide Calabria’s , attacking presence was significantly limited . Another key feature of this formation was in the center , where two pairs of holding and attacking midfielders formed a square , supporting each other offensively and defensively .\nHowever , with the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimović in January 2020 , Pioli switched Milans formation to his long favored 4–2–3–1 , primarily in order to accommodate for the Swedish ageing yet prolific goalscorer , in which he would play up front without much of a defensive work other than pressing , alternating between the roles of a classical striker , a target forward , and a false 9 . The switch of formation also allowed Hakan Çalhanoğlu , an attacking midfielder in a number 10 role , to return to his preferred position as a playmaker behind the main striker , out of which he had been playing for years in various other formations . Ante Rebić and Ismaël Bennacer , the two high-profile new arrivals struggling to fit into the previous coachs system , were given a few more opportunities to prove themselves ; as a result , the former got to play in his favorite position as a left winger and quickly topped the clubs seasonal goalscoring chart , while the latter formed an efficient double pivot with Franck Kessié , who also significantly improved the quality of his performances .\nPersonal life .\nOn 14 November 2020 , Pioli , alongside his assistant Giacomo Murelli , tested positive for COVID-19 amid its pandemic in Italy . While in quarantine , Pioli continued to be in charge of the team via Zoom and with the help of another member of his coaching staff , Daniele Bonera . Despite these setbacks , Milan had a 3–1 away victory over Napoli in Serie A and a 1–1 away draw with Lille in Europa League .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\n- Parma\n- Serie C1 : 1983–84\n- Juventus\n- Serie A : 1985–86\n- European Cup : 1984–85\n- Intercontinental Cup : 1985\n- Fiorentina\n- Serie B : 1993–94\nManager .\n- Bologna\n- Allievi Under-17 National Championship : 2000–01",

He began his career as a striker at Perth Glory but has played primarily as a winger since moving to Europe . Born in Ukraine , Rukavytsya represents Australia internationally .\nPersonal life .\nRukavytsya was born in Mykolayiv , in the then Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union ; his family moved to Australia when he was 14 years old , settling in Perth . He played junior football for Inglewood United and Perth SC in the Football West State League while attending Mount Lawley Senior High School , before being offered a spot at the Australian Institute of Sport on a football scholarship .\nRukavytsya is married to an Israeli and is currently in the process of obtaining Israeli citizenship .\nClub career .\nRukavytsya joined Perth Glory on a short-term replacement deal in the latter stages of the 2006–07 A-League season , making three appearances for the club . In March 2007 , he signed a contract with the Glory to keep him at the club until the end of the 2008–09 A-League season .\nAfter an excellent pre-season , the start of the 2007–08 A-League season was difficult for both Rukavytsya and Perth Glory . However , with the departure of coach Ron Smith , Rukavytsya turned his form around starting by scoring two goals against the Newcastle Jets in David Mitchells first game as coach and another two goals against Melbourne Victory at home on 2 December 2007 . By the end of the 2007–08 A-League season , Rukavytsya managed to score six goals in the last eight games of the campaign .\nIn April 2008 he was invited to trial with Hannover 96 in Germany . It ultimately proved unsuccessful , and he returned to Perth Glory for the start of the 2008–09 season .\nIn January 2009 , he undertook a week-long trial at Dutch club FC Twente . After the last game of the 2008–09 A-League season , it was announced that he would officially be transferring to FC Twente in a transfer deal rumoured to be worth A$1.2 Million .\nRukavytsya scored his first goal for FC Twente in the clubs 8–0 Dutch Cup drubbing of SC Joure .

    "story": "Joe Allon\nJoseph Ball Allon ( born 12 November 1966 ) is an English former footballer . A striker , he scored 135 goals in 361 league and cup games in a 14-year career in the English Football League .\nStarting his career with Newcastle United in 1984 , he failed to break into the first team and moved on to Swansea City three years later . After a season with the Swans he signed with Hartlepool United . After scoring 50 league goals for the club he transferred to Chelsea in 1991 . After a season with Chelsea , including a loan spell with Port Vale , he joined Brentford . In 1994 , he moved back to Port Vale permanently , before moving back to Hartlepool United via Lincoln City in 1995 . He retired in 1998 because of a knee injury . He won three promotions with three clubs , and was voted onto the Fourth Division PFA Team of the Year in 1990–91 and won the North-East Footballer of the Year award in 1990-91 .\nPlaying career .\nNewcastle United .\nA forward , Allon started his professional career with Newcastle United in 1984 , at a time when Jack Charlton was manager at St James Park . At the end of 1984–85 he starred in the FA Youth Cup final victory over Watford , scoring twice in a game in which Paul Gascoigne also netted a wonder goal . Allon scored twice in nine First Division games in 1985–86 and 1986–87 , before manager Willie McFaul moved him on to Swansea City in August 1987 .\nSwansea City .\nTerry Yoraths Swans won promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1987–88 after beating Torquay United 5–4 on aggregate in the play-off final . During the season Allon also scored against rivals Cardiff City in the South Wales derby , in a 2–2 draw at Vetch Field on New Years Day . He scored 12 times in 40 league and cup appearances in a partnership with Colin Pascoe , before he returned to the North-East to join Hartlepool United in November 1988 , as one of Bobby Moncurs first signings as manager . Moncur drove from Hartlepool to South Wales to watch the striker in a reserve game and decided to sign him .\nHartlepool United .\nPools paid a nominal fee for the striker to bring him back to the North East . Pools struggled near the foot of the Football League in 1988–89 under Moncur , and Allon scored just five goals in 26 starts . The team again struggled in 1989–90 , and suffered a number of heavy defeats under Moncur – losing 7–1 at York , 6–1 at Aldershot and 6–0 at home to Doncaster . As Pools improved in the second half of the season and moved off bottom spot after being rooted there with 9 points from 18 games , Allon managed 17 goals in 45 league starts to become the clubs joint top-scorer with strike partner Paul Baker . New boss Cyril Knowles was the catalyst for change as he turned the clubs fortunes around . Allon enjoyed a reunion with his former Newcastle United teammate Gascoigne in September 1990 as Pools played Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup . Gascoigne netted 4 in a 5–0 White Hart Lane defeat for Pools , who lost the second-leg 2–1 at the Victoria Ground .\nAllon netted the winning goal for Pools at Feethams in November 1990 , as Pools beat rivals Darlington 1–0 . By scoring the winning goal at Feethams in 1997 , the striker holds the distinction of being the only Pools striker to have twice scored a winning goal in front of the Tin Shed , the favoured end for supporters of Darlington .\nAllon netted 35 times as Pools won promotion in 1990–91 for only the second time in their history . Pools finished third , but were only one point behind champions Darlington . Allon hit 35 goals in 55 games in the campaign , and was named Hennessey Cognac North East Player of the Year and North East Football Writers Player of the Year , and was also voted onto the PFA Team of the Year .\nChelsea .\nHis form that season earned him a move to top-flight side Chelsea in August 1991 , with manager Ian Porterfield paying a fee reported to be £250,000 . Middlesbrough were also interested in his services that summer . Allon scored at home on his Chelsea debut , at the Shed End , however , he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge , and in February of the 1991–92 season he joined Port Vale on loan , but made just six goalless appearances for John Rudges Valiants , who struggled in vain to avoid relegation out of the Second Division . He only stayed for a few months of 1992–93 , the inaugural season of the Premier League . It was rumoured that his friendship with Vinnie Jones led him astray and helped to bring about his poor form . In all he started just four games ( with a further 14 substitute appearances ) and scored three goals for the Blues . He was sold to Brentford in November 1992 for a club-record incoming fee of £275,000 .\nBrentford .\nThe Bees were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1992–93 season under Phil Holder . He scored a total of 28 goals in 56 league and cup appearances at Griffin Park . He also had a brief spell on loan at Southend United in September 1993 .\nPort Vale .\nAllon moved to back Port Vale – this time permanently – in March 1994 . He scored twice in what remained of the 1993–94 campaign , helping the club to win promotion out of the Second Division . He bagged seven goals at Vale Park in 1994–95 , before he was sold to Third Division side Lincoln City for £42,500 in July 1995 .\nLincoln City and return to Hartlepool .\nAfter just five games and three months at Sincil Bank he was on the move again , during which manager Sam Ellis was replaced by John Beck , and returned to Victoria Park when Hartlepool manager Keith Houchen splashed out £40,000 . He scored nine goals in 24 games in 1995–96 to become joint top-scorer , but a persistent knee injury restricted his first team appearances . He scored 11 goals in 34 games in 1996–97 to again become the clubs top-scorer , as Hartlepool finished just four points above the bottom of the Football League under the stewardship of Mick Tait . His goal spree towards the end of the season helped the club to avoid a drop into the Conference . He only made it onto the pitch five times in 1997–98 , but still found the net twice , both against Colchester at Victoria Park , before he retired due to injury . His total of 79 goals for Hartlepool puts him in seventh place in their overall list of top scorers . He remains a Pools hero for his exploits in 1990-91 .\nPost-retirement .\nAfter retiring from football , Allon presented an award-winning BBC Inside Out documentary on grassroots sport , and worked as a summariser at BBC Tees radio . Between 2006 and 2008 Allon worked under ex-Chelsea teammate Dennis Wise on the coaching staff at Leeds United . He suffered a mental breakdown following the death of his mother due to Alzheimers disease in 2007 . He has been a regular on the North East after-dinner circuit and has penned a play paying tribute to the life of his former Newcastle United boss Jack Charlton .\nStatistics .\nSource :\nHonours .\n- Individual\n- Hennessey Cognac North East Player of the Year : 1990–91\n- North East Football Writers Player of the Year : 1990–91\n- PFA Team of the Year : 1990–91\n- Newcastle United\n- FA Youth Cup : 1985\n- Swansea City\n- Football League Fourth Division play-offs : 1988\n- Hartlepool United\n- Football League Fourth Division third-place promotion : 1990–91\n- Port Vale\n- Football League Second Division runner-up : 1993–94",

    "story": "RAF Lakenheath\nRoyal Air Force Lakenheath or RAF Lakenheath is a Royal Air Force station near the village of Lakenheath in Suffolk , England , UK , north-east of Mildenhall and west of Thetford . The base also sits close to Brandon .\nDespite being an RAF station , Lakenheath currently only hosts United States Air Force units and personnel . The host wing is the 48th Fighter Wing ( 48 FW ) , also known as the Liberty Wing , assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa ( USAFE-AFAFRICA ) .\nHistory .\nFirst World War .\nThe first use of Lakenheath Warren as a Royal Flying Corps airfield was during the First World War , when the area was made into a bombing and ground-attack range for aircraft flying from elsewhere in the area . It appears to have been little used , and was abandoned when peace came in 1918 .\nSecond World War ( 1940–1945 ) .\nRoyal Air Force use .\nIn 1940 , the Air Ministry selected Lakenheath as an alternative for nearby RAF Mildenhall and used it as a decoy airfield . False lights , runways and aircraft diverted Luftwaffe attacks from Mildenhall .\nSurfaced runways were constructed in 1941 , with the main runway ( 04/22 ) being , and the subsidiaries at ( 12/30 ) and ( 16/34 ) . Another was added to runway 16/34 . Hardstands for thirty-six aircraft were built , along with two T-2 and a B-1 hangar . One T-2 was on the technical site , the other hangars to the east across the Mildenhall-Brandon road ( A1065 ) were reached by taxiways .\nLakenheath was used by RAF flying units on detachment late in 1941 . The station soon functioned as a Mildenhall satellite with Short Stirling bombers of No . 149 Squadron dispersed from the parent airfield as conditions allowed . The squadron exchanged its Vickers Wellingtons for Stirlings late in November 1941 . After becoming fully operational with its new aircraft , the squadron moved into Lakenheath on 6 April 1942 and remained until mid 1944 when the squadron moved to RAF Methwold in Norfolk .\nTaking part in more than 350 operations , more than half mine-laying , No . 149 Squadron had one of the lowest percentage loss rates of all Stirling squadrons . One Stirling pilot , Flight Sergeant Rawdon Middleton , was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for valour on the night of 28–29 November 1942 , when despite serious face wounds and loss of blood from shell-fire during a raid on the Fiat works at Turin in Italy , he brought the damaged aircraft back towards southern England . With fuel nearly exhausted his crew were ordered to bail out . Middleton was killed when the Stirling , BF372 OJ-H , crashed into the English Channel .\nIn early 1943 , three T-2 hangars were erected on the north side of the airfield for glider storage , forty Horsa Gliders being dispersed at Lakenheath during that year .\nOn 21 June 1943 , No . 199 Squadron was established as a second Stirling squadron . Commencing operations on 31 July , it laid mines during the winter of 1943–44 . At the end of April 1944 , after sixty-eight operations , the squadron transferred to No . 100 Group for bomber support , moving to RAF North Creake in Norfolk on 1 May 1944 .\nNo . 149 Squadron ended its association with RAF Lakenheath the same month , taking its Stirlings to RAF Methwold . Between them , the two squadrons lost 116 Stirling bombers in combat while flying from Lakenheath .\nThe reason for the departure of the two bomber squadrons was Lakenheaths selection for upgrading to a Very Heavy Bomber airfield . Lakenheath was one of three RAF airfields being prepared to receive United States Army Air Forces Boeing B-29 Superfortresses , which were tentatively planned to replace some of Eighth Air Forces Third Air Division Consolidated B-24 Liberator groups in the spring of 1945 .\nThe work entailed removal of the existing runways and laying new ones comprising of high-grade concrete . The main runway ( 07/25 ) was long ; the subsidiaries , 01/19 and 14/32 , both ; all three being wide . Part of the A1065 road between Brandon and Mildenhall was closed , and a new section built further to the east on the Warren . During the peak period of construction , over 1,000 men were working on the site ; yet instead of the 12 months planned , it took 18 months for the ground work alone and years before Lakenheaths transformation was complete . The cost was nearly £2 million .\nBy the time construction ended the war with Germany was over and RAF Lakenheath was put on a care and maintenance status .\nCold War ( 1946–1990 ) .\nCold War tensions with the Soviet Union in Europe began as early as 1946 . In November , President Harry S . Truman ordered Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) B-29 bombers to RAF Burtonwood in Lancashire , and from there to various bases in West Germany as a training deployment . In May 1947 , additional B-29s were sent to the UK and Germany to keep up the presence of a training program . These deployments were only a pretense , as the true aim of these B-29s was to have a strategic air force permanently stationed in Europe .\nIn April 1947 , RAF Bomber Command returned to Lakenheath and had the runways repaired , resurfaced , and readied for operations by May 1948 .\nStrategic Air Command .\nIn response to the threat by the Soviet Union , by the 1948 Berlin blockade , President Truman decided to realign United States Air Force Europe ( USAFE ) into a permanent combat-capable force . In July , B-29 Superfortresses of the SAC 2nd Bombardment Group were deployed to Lakenheath for a 90-day temporary deployment .\nOn 27 November 1948 , operational control of RAF Lakenheath was transferred from the Royal Air Force to USAFE . The first USAFE host unit at Lakenheath was the 7504th Base Completion Squadron , being activated on that date . The squadron was elevated to an Air Base Group ( ABG ) on 28 January 1950 , and to a Wing ( ABW ) on 26 September 1950 .\nControl of Lakenheath was allocated to the Third Air Force at RAF South Ruislip , which had command of SAC B-29 operations in England . The Third Air Force was subsequently placed directly under USAF orders , with SAC establishing the 7th Air Division Headquarters at RAF Mildenhall . The collocation of the two headquarters within the United Kingdom allowed HQ USAFE to discharge its responsibilities in England , while at the same time allowing SAC to continue in its deterrent role while retaining operational control over flying activities at Lakenheath .\nBy 1950 , Lakenheath was one of three main operating bases for the SAC in the UK , the others being RAF Marham and RAF Sculthorpe both in Norfolk . A succession of bombardment squadrons and wings , thirty-three in all , rotated through Lakenheath , the B-29s giving way to the improved Boeing B-50 Superfortresses and subsequently , in June 1954 , Boeing B-47 Stratojets .\nOn 1 May 1951 , Lakenheath was transferred from USAFE to SAC , and placed under the 3909th Air Base Group . By 1952 , a high security perimeter fencing was erected . The 3909th moved to RAF Greenham Common in Berkshire during 1954 , and was replaced by the 3910th Air Base Group.Known SAC units which deployed to RAF Lakenheath on temporary duty ( TDY ) were :\n- 830th Bombardment Squadron ( 1 June 1949 – 21 August 1949 ) ( B-50D ) ( TDY from the 509th Composite Group , Walker AFB , New Mexico )\n- 65th Bombardment Squadron ( 15 August 1949 – 15 November 1949 ) ( B-50D ) ( TDY From the 43d Bombardment Wing , Davis-Monthan AFB , Arizona )\n- 33d Bombardment Squadron ( 20 November 1949 – 18 February 1950 ) ( B-29 ) ( TDY From the 22d Bombardment Wing , March AFB , California )\n- 96th Bombardment Squadron ( 22 February 1950 – 12 May 1950 ) ( B-50D ) ( TDY From the 2d Bombardment Wing , Hunter AFB , Georgia )\n- 301st Bombardment Wing ( 28 June 1950 – 28 November 1950 ) ( B-29 ) ( TDY From Barksdale AFB , Louisiana )\n- 97th Bombardment Wing ( 15 March 1952 – 1 April 1952 ) ( B-50D , KC-97 ) ( TDY From Biggs AFB , Texas )\n- 19th Bombardment Squadron ( 6 September 1951 – 13 December 1951 ) ( B-29 ) ( TDY From the 22d Bombardment Wing , March AFB , California )\nThe increasing tension of the Cold War lead to a re-evaluation of these deployments , and by 1953 SAC bombers began to move its heavy bomb groups further west , behind RAF fighter forces , to RAF Brize Norton , RAF Greenham Common , RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Fairford , while its shorter-range B-47 were sent to East Anglia .\n- 43d Air Refueling Squadron ( 21 March 1953 – 5 June 1953 ) ( KC-97 ) ( TDY From the 43d Bombardment Wing , Davis-Monthan AFB , Arizona )\n- 321st Bombardment Wing ( 9 December 1954 – 9 March 1955 ) ( B-47 , KC-97 ) ( TDY From Pinecastle AFB , Florida )\n- 40th Bombardment Wing ( 9 June 1955 – 9 September 1955 ) ( B-47 , KC-97 ) ( TDY From Schilling AFB , Kansas )\n- 340th Bombardment Wing ( 14 September 1955 – 3 November 1955 ) ( B-47 , KC-97 ) ( TDY From Whiteman AFB , Missouri )\n- 98th Bombardment Wing ( 12 November 1955 – 28 January 1956 ) ( B-47 , KC-97 ) ( TDY From Lincoln AFB , Nebraska )\n- Lakenheath Task Force ( Provisional ) ( 1 May 1955 – UNK ) ( RB/ERB-47H ) ( Electronic Reconnaissance and Countermeasures ) ( TDY From 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing , Forbes AFB , Kansas )\n- 509th Air Refueling Squadron ( 26 January 1956 – 30 April 1956 ) ( KC-97 ) ( TDY From Walker AFB , New Mexico )\n- 307th Bombardment Wing ( 11 July 1956 – 5 October 1956 ) ( B-47 , KC-97 ) ( TDY From Lincoln AFB , Nebraska )\nMany SAC Squadrons had aircraft at Lakenheath on a transitory basis without any recorded deployment to the base . For example , in January 1951 , a detachment of Convair RB-36D Peacemaker intercontinental bombers from the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Travis AFB , California arrived for a few days , and various tanker and transport aircraft also made periodic appearances at the base . Several of the temporary detachments included in-flight refuelling tanker aircraft .\nOn 30 April 1956 , two Lockheed U-2s were airlifted to Lakenheath to form CIA Detachment A . The first flight of the U-2 was on 21 May . The Central Intelligence Agency unit did not remain long , moving to Wiesbaden Air Base , West Germany on 15 June .\nOn 10 October 1956 , a United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean after departure from RAF Lakenheath for a flight to Lajes Field in the Azores . The aircraft was on a Military Air Transport Service flight carrying 50 members of the 307th Bombardment Wing , on their way home to the United States after a temporary duty assignment and a US Navy crew of nine . All 59 personnel on board were lost .\n48th Tactical Fighter Wing .\nFollowing French president Charles de Gaulles insistence in 1959 that all non-French nuclear-capable forces should be withdrawn from his country , the USAF began a redeployment of its North American F-100-equipped units from France . The 48th TFW left its base at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base , France on 15 January 1960 , its aircraft arriving at Lakenheath that afternoon . When the first F-100D touched down on Lakenheaths runway , the landing symbolised a return for the Statue of Liberty Wing . Almost 16 years had passed since the Second World War Ninth Air Force 48th Fighter Groups arrival at RAF Ibsley , England , for the D-Day invasion .\nIn conjunction with this transfer , control of Lakenheath was transferred from Strategic Air Command back to USAFE . As SAC elements began their departure , the 3910th Air Base Group began its transition of handing Lakenheaths facilities and real estate over to the 48ths Combat Support Group elements .\nThe tactical components of the 48th TFW upon arrival at Lakenheath were :\n- 492d Tactical Fighter Squadron ( LR , blue colours )\n- 493d Tactical Fighter Squadron ( LS , yellow colours )\n- 494th Tactical Fighter Squadron ( LT , red colours )\nThe squadron markings consisted of alternating stripes across the tailfin in squadron colours , with a shadowed V shaped chevron on the nose . Starting in March 1970 , squadron tail codes ( shown above ) were added when the aircraft went from a natural finish to a Southeast Asian camouflage motif .\nThe period between 1972 and 1977 can be described as a five-year aircraft conversion . Beginning in late 1971 , the 48th TFW started its conversion to the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II , with the aircraft being transferred from the 81st TFW at RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk . The conversion to the F-4D took several years , with the last F-100 departing in August 1974 . With the arrival of the Phantoms , the F-4s adopted a common tail code of LK . This tail code lasted only a few months as in July and August 1972 the 48th TFW further recoded to LN . The F-4D carried squadron identifying fin cap colours of blue , yellow and red ( 492d , 493d , 494th respectively ) .\nThe F-4s service with the 48th TFW was short , as operation Ready Switch transferred the F-4D assets to the 474th TFW at Nellis AFB , Nevada . The 474th sent their General Dynamics F-111 . As to the 366th TFW at Mountain Home AFB , Idaho , and the 366th sent their F-111Fs to Lakenheath in early 1977 .\nA fourth fighter squadron , the 495th Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated with the 48th TFW on 1 April 1977 , with a squadron tail colour of green . This was 33 years to the day since the squadrons inactivation . The 495ths mission of functioning as a replacement training unit for the other three fighter squadrons . This made the 495th and the 48th TFW unique , as the only WSO ( Weapons System Operator ) training unit for USAFE .\nF-111s from the 48th TFW participated in 1986 United States bombing of Libya in 1986 . This bombing of Libya prompted the mock-acronym , Lakenheath Is Bombing Your Ass . During the operation one F-111 from Lakenheath was shot down by Libyan forces and the two crew members were killed . The Libyan government eventually returned one of the bodies .\nPost Cold War ( 1991 – present ) .\nLakenheath received its first McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagles in 1992 . With the departure of the F-111s , the 495th FS was inactivated on 13 December 1991 . On 18 December 1992 , the last F-111 departed the base . Along with its departure , the 493d FS was also inactivated .\nWith the pending closure of Bitburg Air Base in Germany on 25 February 1994 , it was decided to reactivate the 493d as an F-15C/D squadron . Aircraft were transferred from the 33d Fighter Wing at Eglin AFB , Florida , and the 493d was reactivated on 1 January . The 493ds arrival meant that the 48th became the largest F-15E/F-15C composite unit in the U.S . Air Force .\nIn 2003 , the 48th FW received the first of ten new F-15Es . The aircraft were part of the final batch of F-15s expected to be ordered by the Air Force .\nOn 2 March 2011 , members of the 48th Security Forces Squadron were involved in a shooting at Frankfurt Airport in Germany . The members were on a bus bound for Ramstein Air Base in Germany when they were attacked by a lone gunman .\nOn 22 March 2011 , F-15E 91-0304 crash-landed and was destroyed in eastern Libya after reportedly suffering from a mechanical failure . Both crewmen ejected and were safely recovered . On 7 January 2014 , a Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk from the base crashed following a bird strike while on a low-level training exercise with another helicopter ( also a Pave Hawk ) , into the Cley Marshes near Cley next the Sea on the nearby North Norfolk coast . All four occupants died in the crash .\nOn 8 October 2014 , F-15D 86-0182 belonging to the 493d Fighter Squadron crashed during a training flight in a field outside Spalding , Lincolnshire . The pilot successfully ejected and was shortly recovered back to Lakenheath on board a Pave Hawk .\nA US Marine Corps Boeing F/A-18 Hornet of VMFA-232 Red Devils from MCAS . Miramar , California , crashed after taking off from RAF Lakenheath on 21 October 2015 . The pilot , Major Taj Cabbie Sareen ( 34 ) , did not survive .\nOn 15 June 2020 , an F-15C belonging to the 493d Fighter Squadron crashed during a training flight in the North Sea , 74 nautical miles east of Scarborough at about . The body of pilot\n1st Lt . Kenneth Allen has been found deceased .\nNear nuclear disasters .\nBecause RAF Lakenheath was one of several British air bases which was used by the U.S . Air Force to store nuclear weapons during the Cold War , there was a possibility of nuclear incidents occurring at the air base . Records show that there were at least two serious near nuclear disasters at the base . The first near nuclear accident occurred on 27 July 1956 , when a B-47 bomber crashed into a storage igloo containing three Mark-6 nuclear weapons . The aircraft exploded and the nuclear bombs were showered with burning fuel . Although the bombs did not have their plutonium fissile cores installed , each of them contained a quantity of depleted uranium-238 . The crash and ensuing fire did not ignite the high explosives and no detonation occurred . However , a bomb disposal expert stated it was a miracle exposed detonators on one bomb did not fire , which would have released nuclear material into the environment . The B-47 involved in the accident , which killed four crewmen , was part of the 307th Bombardment Wing .\nThe event caused great concern for the British government , and as a result of the incident it was determined that it would be desirable to block US authorities from ordering evacuations in future if one of its nuclear weapons fell upon the British countryside . This began a debate over how to block the US military from alerting the public - and thereby causing expected national panic . The policy for the next few years was to completely deny any incident had occurred if the press got word of a nuclear accident . A similar near nuclear disaster occurred at RAF Greenham Common less than two years later in February 1958 , when an aircraft allegedly carrying a nuclear bomb caught fire .\nThe 1956 incident was not a freak occurrence , and a second near nuclear disaster occurred at Lakenheath five years later . In January 1961 , a parked U.S . Air Force F-100 Super Sabre loaded with a mark 28 hydrogen bomb caught fire after the pilot accidentally jettisoned his fuel tanks , rupturing as they struck the concrete runway beneath . The aviation fuel ignited and flames engulfed the nuclear bomb beneath the aircraft , but the fire was brought under control before the bombs high explosive detonated or before the fire caused the bombs arming components to function . However , the incident left the weapon scorched and blistered .\nRole and operations .\nThe 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath is the Statue of Liberty Wing , the only USAF wing with both a number and a name . Since activation at Chaumont-Semoutiers AB , France , on 10 July 1952 , Liberty Wing has been one of the premier fighter wings of the United States Air Forces in Europe , spending over 50 years as part of USAFE . The 48 FW has nearly 5,700 active-duty military members , 2,000 British and U.S . civilians , and includes a Geographically Separate Unit ( GSU ) at nearby RAF Feltwell .\nTactical squadrons of the 48th Operations Group are :\n- 492nd Fighter Squadron ( F-15E )\n- 493rd Fighter Squadron ( F-15C/D )\n- 494th Fighter Squadron ( F-15E )\nAircraft of the 48th FW carry the tail code LN .\nIn addition to supporting three combat-ready squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft , the Liberty Wing housed the 56th Rescue Squadrons HH-60G Combat Search and Rescue helicopters . The 56th and 57th Rescue Squadrons re-located to Aviano Air Base in 2018 .\nRAF Lakenheath and its sister base RAF Mildenhall are the two main U.S . Air Force bases in United Kingdom , and 48th Fighter Wing is the only U.S . Air Force F-15 fighter wing in U.K . and also in Europe .\nBased units .\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at RAF Lakenheath .\nUnited States Air Force .\nUnited States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa ( USAFE-AFAFRICA )\n- 48th Fighter Wing\n- 48th Operations Group\n- 492nd Fighter Squadron – F-15E Strike Eagle\n- 493nd Fighter Squadron – F-15C/D Eagle\n- 494th Fighter Squadron – F-15E Strike Eagle\n- 48th Operations Support Squadron\n- 48th Maintenance Group\n- 48th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron\n- 748th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron\n- 48th Component Maintenance Squadron\n- 48th Equipment Maintenance Squadron\n- 48th Maintenance Operations Squadron\n- 48th Munitions Squadron\n- 48th Medical Group\n- 48th Dental Squadron\n- 48th Inpatient Operations Squadron\n- 48th Medical Operations Squadron\n- 48th Medical Support Squadron\n- 48th Surgical Operations Squadron\n- 48th Mission Support Group\n- 48th Civil Engineer Squadron\n- 48th Communications Squadron\n- 48th Contracting Squadron\n- 48th Force Support Squadron\n- 48th Logistics Readiness Squadron\n- 48th Security Forces Squadron\nFuture .\nF-35A Lightning II .\nIn January 2015 , the US Department of Defense announced that from 2020 , Lakenheath would become home to 54 of the US Air Forces Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II multi-role fighters . The aircraft would be split between two squadrons and there would be an increase of 1,200 military personnel and between 60 and 100 civilian workers at the station . The F-35 would operate alongside the two existing F-15E squadrons based at Lakenheath . By November 2018 , the number of craft had been revised to 48 and their arrival date as late 2021 .\nF-35 Infrastructure .\nTo accommodate the new aircraft a F-35 Campus is to be constructed on the south side of the airfield .\nProjects .\nThe main new operational buildings being developed as part of the F-35 project are as follows .\n- Two six-bay maintenance hangars – Space for service , maintenance , storage , and staff support facilities ( to be known as Hangars 4-1 and 4–2 ) .\n- Hangar 6 ( Consolidated Parts Store ) – Single-storey extension to the southern side of Hangar 6 , including offices and warehouses and the storage of aircraft equipment and parts .\n- Dual Squadron Operations/Aircraft Maintenance Unit – A three-storey building to provide combined facilities for two squadrons comprising Squadron Operations and Aircraft Maintenance Unit ( AMU ) facilities , including mission planning , administration space in the operations section and offices to manage the maintenance of aircraft and storage space .\n- Corrosion control and wash rack facility – Comprising single-storey hangar to maintain aircraft including a paint and sanding booth and wash rack .\n- Flight simulator facility – Comprising a single-storey building to accommodate six F-35A flight simulators , administration , records , classrooms , brief/debrief rooms , and storage space .\n- A Field Training Detachment Facility , comprising A three-storey building to provide F-35A training programme to maintain the aircraft , incorporating classrooms and administration rooms . Field Training Detachment Facility – A three-storey building to provide F-35A maintenance , including classrooms and administration rooms .\n- Aircraft Ground Equipment ( AGE ) Facilities – A single storey building extension and new covered storage associated with an existing building used for maintenance and storage of AGE related to the F-35A .\n- Fuel System Maintenance Dock – A single storey hangar with fuel system maintenance dock to support the operation of the F-35A .\n- Munitions Maintenance Facility – A single storey building extension and new covered storage to an existing building for the maintenance of munitions used by the F-35A .\n- Residential accommodation – A three or four-storey dormitory for up to 144 beds to accommodate the increase in station personnel .\n- Flight-line Dining Facility\n- Munitions Storage Administration Maintenance building\n- Hospital – Replacement medical facility up to four storeys to provide inpatient services , outpatient and speciality care clinics , ancillary services , support and medical administrative functions .\n- High school – A three or four-storey building to house approximately 560 students .\nThe airfield operational surfaces would also be expanded as follows .\n- Charlie Apron , currently used by F-15s will be redeveloped and extended to allow the parking of up to forty-two F-35A aircraft in dual-occupancy shelters constructed from a light weight , canopy structure with open sides . The total area of Charlie Apron once extended will be approximately 78,392 square metres , combining the retained area of 58,780 square metres with the new area of 19,612 square metres . It will be connected to Maintenance Hangars 4-1 and 4-2 and the Squadron Operations/AMU building .\n- Alpha-Bravo Apron will be extended to accommodate existing F-15 aircraft currently using Charlie Apron . The total area of Alpha-Bravo Apron once extended will be approximately 54,179 square metres , combining the retained area of 39,750 square metres with the new area of 14,429 square metres . Up to thirty-eight F-15 aircraft will be capable of being accommodated on the open apron which would not feature any shelters .\nInfrastructure delivery .\nInvestment of $148.4 million ( £116.7M ) for the delivery of F-35A infrastructure at Lakenheath was authorised by the US administration in August 2018 .\nIn November 2018 , the Defence Infrastructure Organisation awarded a £160M contract for infrastructure work to a joint venture between Kier Group and VolkerFitzpatrick .\nTo make way for the F-35 Campus , demolition of the first of eighteen buildings began in March 2019 . The work on Alpha-Bravo Apron was completed in August 2020 , allowing F-15E Strike Eagle operations of the 492nd and 494th Fighter Squadrons to be consolidated on one ramp .\nHeritage .\nGate guardian .\nRAF Lakenheaths gate guardian is North American F-100D Super Sabre , serial number 54-2269 . The aircraft was originally delivered to the French Air Force . On return it was moved to the Wings of Liberty Memorial Park at RAF Lakenheath . Firstly it was painted as 55-4048 , latterly as 56-3319 .\nProtests .\nSince the bases founding , RAF Lakenheath has been targeted for numerous peace protests from groups such as Stop the war coalition and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament .\nPershing .\nLakenheath was one of the proposed sites of the NATO Pershing II Missile System . The deployment of the Missile system sparked protests all over Western Europe , and RAF Lakenheath was one of the most prominent military sites . The radical historian E.P . Thompson wrote in a pamphlet that basing the system at RAF Lakenheath directly endangered the lives of those in the nearby city of Cambridge:...Lakenheath is , by crow or cruise , just over twenty miles from Cambridge . It is possible that Cambridge but less probable that Oxford will fall outside the CEP . Within the CEP we must suppose some fifteen or twenty detonations at least on the scale of Hiroshima , without taking into account any possible detonations , release of radio-active materials , etc. , if the strike should succeed in finding out the cruise missiles at which it was aimed . A semi-permanent peace camp was set up outside RAF Lakenheath . In 1985 , the future Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was arrested for singing psalms at a CND protest at Lakenheath .\nLibya .\nOver 1,000 people demonstrated outside RAF Lakenheath in protest at the 1986 United States bombing of Libya .\nIraq war and later .\nThe 2003 Iraq War sparked a new wave of peace protests . In one incident , 9 protestors gained access to the base by cutting through its perimeter fence.The protestors rode bicycles along the main runway , before chaining themselves together .\nActivists later established a peace camp outside RAF Lakenheath to draw attention to the base .\nIn 2006 , a group of 200 people protested against the alleged nuclear weapons stored at RAF Lakenheath . Addressing the crowd was Jeremy Corbyn , who cycled to RAF Lakenheath from the railway station in Ely . There were further protests on this issue in 2008 .",

    "story": "Lega Nord Friuli-Venezia Giulia\nLega Nord Friuli-Venezia Giulia ( English : Northern League Friuli-Venezia Giulia , LNFVG ) is a regionalist political party in Italy that functions as the national ( hence , regional ) section of Lega Nord in Friuli-Venezia Giulia .\nThe LNFVG is currently led by federal commissioner Vannia Gava . Two of its former leaders , Massimiliano Fedriga and Pietro Fontanini , are President of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Pietro Fontanini mayor of Udine , respectively .\nHistory .\nThe party was founded in 1990 as Lega Friuli by leading members of the Friuli Movement , including Roberto Visentin , Pietro Fontanini , Rinaldo Bosco , Sergio Cecotti and Alessandra Guerra . After that the Friuli Movement decided not join Lega Nord , they formed Lega Friuli in order to join . Visentin was the longstanding leader of the party until 1999 .\nLNF members were President or Vice President of the Region ( 1993–2003 ) , President of the Province of Pordenone ( 1995–1999 ) , President of the Province of Udine ( 1995–1999 ) , mayor of Pordenone ( 1993–2001 ) and mayor of Udine ( 1998–2003 ) . The party was the regions largest at the 1993 regional election ( 26.7% ) and the 1996 general election ( 23.2% ) .\nIn 2001 Lega Nord Friuli was merged with Lega Nord Trieste to form a united regional section . At the time the party suffered many splits and a strong decline in term of votes , especially if compared to neighbouring Liga Veneta .\nIn the 2003 regional election Guerra was candidate for President of the House of Freedoms coalition . She was defeated by Riccardo Illy and the party gained only 9.3% of the vote . Between 2001 and 2007 Visentin , Bosco , Cecotti , Fontanini , Guerra , Giuseppe Zoppolato ( national secretary from 2000 to 2003 ) and Marco Pottino ( national secretary from 2005 to 2007 ) left or were ejected in party struggles . Guerra joined the Democratic Party in 2009 .\nIn 2007 Fontanini was re-integrated in the party and in 2008 he was elected President of the Province of Udine and national secretary of the LNFVG . This represented a sort of return to normality for the party , which won 13.0% of the vote in the general election . At the 2009 European Parliament election the party won 17.5% of the vote , its best score in more than a decade . Moreover , from 2008 to 2013 the party was part of the regional government led by Renzo Tondo of The People of Freedom .\nIn 2012 Fontanini , who had never been able to lead a party divided in too many factions ( notably including those led respectively by Claudio Violino and Enzo Bortolotti ) , stepped down from national secretary . Matteo Piasente was elected in his place with the support of 207 delegates out of 352 during a party congress . Fontanini , who grudgingly favoured Piasente , did not even take part to the congress , but nevertheless continued to be a leading member .\nIn the 2013 regional election the LNFVG obtained a mere 8.3% of the vote and just three regional councillors , due to Tondos defeat . Soon after an expenses scandal , involving Regional Council floor leaders Danilo Narduzzi and Mara Piccin , emerged and the party looked increasingly divided among supporters of Piasente , including Violino and Narduzzi ( who promptly resigned from deputy national secretary ) , Massimiliano Fedriga and Fontanini , who asked Piasente to resign . He actually stepped down in late June and was replaced by federal commissioner Gianpaolo Dozzo , who strove to maintain party unity .\nIn 2014 , at a congress in Udine , Fedriga was unanimously elected national secretary , the first hailing from the Venetian-speaking Trieste in partys history .\nIn the 2018 regional election Fedriga was elected President with 57.1% of the vote and the party obtained 34.9% of the vote .\nPopular support .\nIn the 2018 regional election the party obtained its best result until that moment : 34.9% of the vote . The partys strongholds are Carnia ( 46.5% ) , which is part of the province of Udine ( 34.2% , without Carnia , which forms a separate constituency ) , and the province of Pordenone ( 36.7% ) .\nThe electoral results of Lega Nord in the region are shown in the tables below .\nLeadership .\n<onlyinclude>\n- National Secretary : Roberto Visentin ( 1990–1999 ) , Edouard Ballaman ( 1999–2000 ) , Giuseppe Zoppolato ( 2000–2003 ) , Fulvio Follegot ( 2003–2005 ) , Marco Pottino ( 2005–2007 ) , Manuela Dal Lago ( federal commissioner , 2007–2008 ) , Pietro Fontanini ( 2008–2012 ) , Matteo Piasente ( 2012–2013 ) , Gianpaolo Dozzo ( federal commissioner , 2013–2014 ) , Massimiliano Fedriga ( 2014–2019 ) , Vannia Gava ( federal commissioner , 2019–2020 ) , Marco Dreosto ( federal commissioner , 2020–present )\n- National President : Rinaldo Bosco ( 1991–2003 ) , Alessandra Guerra ( 2005–2007 ) , Enzo Bortolotti ( 2008–2012 ) , Fulvio Follegot ( 2012–2015 ) , Mario Pittoni ( 2016–2019 ) </onlyinclude",

    "story": "Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa\nMarcelo Nuno Duarte Rebelo de Sousa ( ; born 12 December 1948 ) is a Portuguese politician and academic . He is the 20th and current president of Portugal , since 9 March 2016 . A member of the Social Democratic Party ( though he suspended his party membership for the duration of his presidency ) , Rebelo de Sousa has served as a government minister , parliamentarian in the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic , legal scholar , journalist , political analyst , law professor and pundit gaining him nationwide recognition prior to his election .\nEarly life .\nBorn in Lisbon , he is the eldest son of Baltasar Rebelo de Sousa ( 1921–2001 ) and his wife Maria das Neves Fernandes Duarte ( 1921–2003 ) . He has said that his mother had Jewish ancestry . He is named after his godfather , Marcelo Caetano , the last prime minister of the Estado Novo regime .\nRebelo de Sousa is a professor and publicist specialized in constitutional law and administrative law , earning his doctorate at University of Lisbon , where he taught law .\nParty politics and academic career .\nRebelo de Sousa started his career during the Estado Novo as a lawyer , and later as a journalist . He joined the Popular Democratic Party , becoming a Deputy to the Assembly of the Republic . During that time , he helped draft Portugals constitution in 1976 . Later he rose to Adjoint Minister of Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemão . Together with him he was a co-founder , Director and Administrator of the Expresso newspaper , owned by Pinto Balsemão . He was also the founder of Sedes and the founder and President of the Administration Council of another newspaper , Semanário . He started as a political analyst and pundit on TSF radio with his Exams , in which he gave marks ( 0 to 20 ) to the main political players .\nIn 1989 he ran for President of the Municipal Chamber of Lisbon ( Mayor of Lisbon ) but lost to Jorge Sampaio , though he did win a seat as City Councilor ( Vereador ) . In that campaign he took a plunge into the waters of the Tagus River to prove they were not polluted despite claims to the contrary . In other local elections , he also became the President of the Municipal Assembly of Cascais ( 1979–1982 ) and the President of the Municipal Assembly of Celorico de Basto ( 1997–2009 ) .\nLeader of the PSD , 1996–1999 .\nRebelo de Sousa was leader of the Social Democratic Party from 29 March 1996 to 27 May 1999 ( some weeks before his election as party leader , he declared he would not be a leadership candidate , not even if Christ came down to Earth ) . He created a center-right coalition , the Democratic Alliance , with the Peoples Party in 1998 . He became , however , the Vice-President of the European Peoples Party–European Democrats . The coalition did not please large parts of its own party , due to the role the Peoples Party leader , Paulo Portas , had in undermining Aníbal Cavaco Silvas government while director of the weekly O Independente .\nRebelo de Sousa resigned after Portas , in a TV interview , described a private talk they had had concerning this matter . Portas claimed Marcelo , as an anonymous source for O Independente , described in great detail a dinner where he was not present , down to the menu ( which included vichyssoise , a cold soup ) ; when Paulo Portas later reneged on the decision of the coalition established between their parties — which was made before that dinner — the term vichyssoise became a reference to that revenge served cold . For these and other inconsistencies , he was called by Manuel Maria Carrilho political gelatin . A speech , in which he condemned the Portuguese habit of expecting a Messiah and a Dom Sebastião , was not well taken . The failure of the coalition led to his public and televised demission .\nPost-leadership .\nHe had a weekly program of political analysis every Sunday on public TV station RTP after previously having a similar program on the private TV station TVI , where he was introduced as being the wisest and most perspicacious political analyst of current times . His comments covered everything from politics to sports , including his famous presentations and comments on the newest published books , and they were sometimes controversial , some of the comments being seen as personal and political attacks .\nIn his analysis , still in TVI , he often attacked Pedro Santana Lopes , accusing him of being truculent , a cudgeller and resentful , and not having the profile to be a President of the Republic . This animosity remained until after Santana Lopes became Prime Minister , with a particular commentary on his performance finishing with the statement that he was worse than the worst Guterres and that he was making Guterres look better and pushing them to Belém , leading to a response from Santana Lopes Government Speaker Rui Gomes da Silva , who accused him of an involuntary cabal . The president of the network , Miguel Pais do Amaral , asked in a private dinner that Marcelo be more moderate in his attacks , something that Marcelo took as a form of censorship , leading to his exit from the program and the channel . It was after that episode that he was hired by RTP .\nPartially in consequence of these events , President Jorge Sampaio dissolved the Assembly of the Republic , a move that also meant dismissing the Government at a time when it had a stable coalition majority , and calling for anticipated elections , which led to the defeat of Santana Lopes and the election of the Socialists under José Sócrates .\nIn 2010 , he left RTP and returned to TVI to do the same program that he had before .\nHe was made a Member of the Council of State , by President Aníbal Cavaco Silva , and was sworn in on 6 April 2006 .\nHe was a leading figure on the pro-life side of the 2007 abortion referendum . He even founded a website titled Assim Não ( Not like this ) , which was divulged with a famous introductory video . It became so well known that it was parodied in Saturday Night Live-fashion by famous humour group Gato Fedorento .\nPresident of Portugal , 2016–present .\nOn 24 January 2016 , Rebelo de Sousa was elected as President of Portugal in the first round of voting . He stood as an independent , appealing for moderation and cross-party consensus . During his election campaign , he promised to repair political divisions and the hardship of Portugals 2011–14 bailout . Unlike his predecessor , Aníbal Cavaco Silva , he had never previously held a top state position .\nIn March 2020 , Rebelo de Sousa asked parliament to authorize a state of emergency to contain the COVID-19 pandemic ; this marked the first time the country declared a state of emergency nationwide in 46 years of democratic history .\nIn December 2020 , Rebelo de Sousa announced his intention to run for office again in the 2021 Portuguese presidential election .\nMarcelo was re-elected president in January 2021 , with 60.7% of the votes , the third highest vote margin ever in presidential elections in Portugal since the Carnation Revolution . He was also the first candidate ever to win the vote in all municipalities . Ranging from 51.3% in the Beja District and 72.16% in Madeira .\nState visits .\nRebelo de Sousa , as President of Portugal , has visited the Vatican , Spain , Mozambique , Morocco , Brazil , Switzerland , Cuba , United Kingdom , Greece , United States of America and Angola . The first visit was to the Vatican City to meet the Pope Francis and the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin . In 2019 , he joined President Emmanuel Macron for the traditional Bastille Day military parade in Paris , which honoured European military cooperation and the European Intervention Initiative that year .\nHealth .\nOn 28 December 2017 , Rebelo de Sousa was admitted at Curry Cabral Hospital , in Lisbon , where he was subjected to a surgery to treat an umbilical hernia . The procedure was performed by , a veteran surgeon who is also a close friend of the President since early childhood . After the surgery , Barroso informed the press that all went well and that Marcelos condition had been known for at least six years , also referring that the surgery was initially due to occur on 4 January 2018 .

Disney has offered about $2.12 a share , a 67% premium over the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange value as of February 9 . The company expects the buyout and delisting to be finished by June . Plans are for the company to invest another $1.4 billion into Disneyland Paris after the buyout to counteract the recent Paris terrorist attack , which hurt a previous 2014 park hotel investment . If this buyout is successful , it would make the resort the only resort 100% owned and operated by Disney outside of the United States of America . On June 13 , 2017 , The Walt Disney Company reached the 95% threshold required for a mandatory takeover according to French law , owning 97.08% of Euro Disney S.C.A. , paving the way for The Walt Disney Company to become the sole owner and operator of Disneyland Paris .\nDisney Parks , Experiences and Products .\nAs part of The Walt Disney Company’s March 2018 strategic reorganization , Disney Consumer Products , and Interactive Media was merged into the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts segment and renamed Walt Disney Parks , Experiences and Products . Parks and Resorts Chairman Bob Chapek was named chairman of this new segment , who also previously served as head of Disney Consumer Products .

This mirrors the Disney Parks East regional division consisting of Shanghai Disney Resort , Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Attractions Japan and headed by Michael Colglazier . Imagineering was expected to take on the development of merchandise , games , publishing , and apps . Paul Gainer moved up from Disney Retail head to head up the new Global Product Management and Distribution unit , which includes Disney Retail , Global Licensing , and digital guest experience .\nNew Vacation Operations and Disney Cruise Line division was renamed Disney Signature Experiences along with a new president , Jeff Vahle , for the division in April 2018 . On January 1 , 2019 , Walt Disney Parks , Experiences and Consumer Products changed its name to Disney Parks , Experiences and Products . Disney Cruise Line purchase in early March 2019 another Bahamas destination , Lighthouse Point property on the island of Eleuthera . In July 2019 , Disney denied reports of plans to launch its own airline with the purchase of small regional airlines in the United States .\nWith the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by August 2019 , National Geographic Partners non-TV operations were transferred into its Disney counterpart with NG Media and National Geographic Expeditions moving to the segments units , Disney Publishing Worldwide and Disney Signature Experiences , respectively .\nPowell supervised the two Star Wars-themed land , , openings in May at Disneyland and August 2019 in Disneys Hollywood Studios . However , initial numbers showed an attendance dropped instead of the boost such an opening should have generated . In late September , Powell left the company with the Parks West regional division being dissolved , thus having those resorts executives directly report to chairman Chapek . He denied that Powell was let go because of the low attendance issue from Galaxys Edge , but instead , Powells position was a temporary one to allow Chapek to focus on the acquisition of 21st Century Fox .\nPowells departure from Disney was soon followed by a domino of executive appointments , as announced on September 26 , 2019 . George Kalogridis , then-president of the Walt Disney World Resort , was promoted as the president of segment development and enrichment . Kalogridis is replaced by Josh DAmaro , then-president of the Disneyland Resort , as president of the Walt Disney World Resort . In turn , DAmaro was replaced by Rebecca Campbell as president of the Disneyland Resort . Campbell transferred from the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International segment where she served as the president of Europe , the Middle East , and Africa . Both DAmaro and Campbell assumed these roles in November 2019 . In addition , Michael Colglazier is also promoted as the president and managing director of Disney Parks International and will oversee Disneyland Paris as well as those under the Parks East regional division . In February 2020 , Chapek was promoted from chairman of this segment to chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Company under executive chairman Bob Iger .\nWith the closure of all Disney parks in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic , Disney donated 150,000 rain ponchos usually sold at the parks to MedShare , to be distributed in hospitals .\nIn May 2020 , CEO Chapek named new appointees under the Disney Parks , Experiences , and Products segment .

DAmaro cited the uncertainty of the ongoing pandemic as well as Californias continued reluctance to reopen Disneyland as factors . Nearly 6,700 Central Florida employees , including almost 6,500 Disney World workers , were also among those laid off . On October 13 , 2020 , Disney CEO and former Disney Park , Experiences and Products head Bob Chapek agreed to keep Disney World at only 25% capacity until the Center For Disease Control ( CDC ) issued new guidance and also stated that with regards to reopening Disneyland , Its not much of a negotiation . Its pretty much a mandate that we stay closed .\nDisney resorts .\nDisneyland Resort .\nDisneyland was founded as a single park by Walt Disney and opened on July 17 , 1955 , in Anaheim , California .

On September 4 , 2001 , the resort expanded with Tokyo DisneySea . There are several resort hotels on-site , but only three are owned by the resort , which boasts the largest parking structure in the world . Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering , the resort is fully owned and operated by The Oriental Land Company and licensed by The Walt Disney Company . The Walt Disney Attractions Japan team at The Walt Disney Company communicates with the Oriental Land Company over all aspects of the resort and assigns Imagineers to it . Its properties , below , are divided into parks , shopping centers , and lodging .\n- Shopping , dining , and entertainment complex : Ikspiari\nDisneyland Paris .\nDisneyland Paris , Disneys second international resort complex , and the largest Disney resort outside the United States , opened on April 12 , 1992 , as Euro Disney Resort . Located in Marne-la-Vallée in the suburbs of Paris , France , it features two theme parks , a golf course , an entertainment complex , and seven Disney resort hotels .

It is owned and operated by Hong Kong International Theme Parks , an incorporated company jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and the Government of Hong Kong . The first phase of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort occupies .\nShanghai Disney Resort .\nIn November 2009 , Disney received approval from the central government of China to build a Disney theme park , Shanghai Disneyland Park , in Shanghais Pudong district . China is one of the most dynamic , exciting and important countries in the world and this approval marks a very significant milestone for Walt Disney Co in mainland China , said Robert Iger , president and CEO of Disney . The resort opened on June 16 , 2016 . A groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 7 , 2011 .\n- Shopping , dining , and entertainment complex : Disneytown\nTraining .\nEach new employee ( cast member ) at a Disney theme park is trained at a Disney University , founded by Walt Disney in 1955 . Before training specific to the work they will perform , each employee attends the Disney Traditions course where they learn about the philosophies and history of Disneys guest services .\nAbandoned and misreported concepts .\nDisney were in talks in the late 1950s to build a Disney resort in Nara , Japan . The project was midway through construction when Disney pulled out over a license fee disagreement- with the park ultimately opening independently as Nara Dreamland in 1961 and still strongly resembling Disneyland . The park went into a slow decline after Disney opened their resort in Tokyo in 1983 , and it closed in 2006 .\nDisney had plans to build Walt Disneys Riverfront Square in St . Louis , but canceled the project in July 1965 .\nIn the 1960s , Disney initiated a plan for a ski resort at Mineral King in California . Opposition from environmental groups led by the Sierra Club led to a temporary court injunction in 1969 and legal battles through the 1970s . The projects planning and scale changed multiple times , and in 1978 , Mineral King was annexed into Sequoia National Park , ending any possibility of developing a resort there .\nDisney had plans to build a park named Disneys America in Haymarket , Virginia , but abandoned the idea in 1994 . On September 28 , 1994 , Michael Eisner announced Disney was canceling its plans after a bruising national media fight with Protect Historic America , and aggressive local opposition in Virginia from Protect Prince William and other citizen groups .\nDisney had plans to build a smaller Disneyland-style theme park in Sydney , Australia , between 2007 and 2008 , with the proposed name Disney Wharf at Sydney Harbour , but the concept was abandoned due to mixed responses in the New South Wales Government .\nIn early January 2011 , conflicting reports emerged regarding Disneys involvement in a proposed entertainment complex in Haifa , Israel , whose plans include a small ( 30,000 square meter ) amusement park scheduled to open in 2013 . The project will be partially funded by Shamrock Holdings , a Disney-affiliated investment firm . In the wake of reports from Israeli business newspaper , Globes and industry newswire Amusement Management that Disney itself would be involved in the projects development , a spokesperson for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts clarified to Fast Company that Disney did not have any plans to be involved in the building of the park .\nDisney intellectual properties outside Disney parks .\nDue to its acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 , Lucasfilm in 2012 and 20th Century Studios in 2019 , some Disney-owned franchises are represented in its competitors parks .\nMarvel Entertainment .\nMarvel Super Hero Island , a themed land featuring characters and settings from Marvel Comics , has operated at Universal Orlando Resorts Islands of Adventure park since 1999 , as well as the Islands of Adventure , cloned ride The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man at Universal Studios Japan since 2004 . Under Marvels 1994 agreement with Universal Parks & Resorts in regional terms , none of the Marvel characters and other persons related to such characters ( e.g. , side characters , team members , and the villains associated with the Avengers , Fantastic Four , X-Men , Spider-Man , etc. ) connected with Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Japan can be used at Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort . The Disneyland Resort , Walt Disney World Resort , and Tokyo Disney Resort also cannot use the Marvel brand name as part of an attraction or marketing and the Marvel-themed simulator ride . This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet-and-greets with Marvel characters not associated with the ones present at Islands of Adventure , such as Star-Lord and Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy , and Doctor Strange . Hong Kong Disneyland , Shanghai Disneyland , and Disneyland Paris either have or planned to incorporate meet and greets as well as attractions relating to the Marvel characters , as well as using the Marvel name and the Marvel simulator ride .\nIMG Worlds of Adventure in Dubai has a Marvel-themed section .\nStar Wars .\nA Star Wars-themed section of Legoland Californias Miniland USA opened in 2011 , with a similar version opening at Legoland Florida in November 2012 , just weeks before Disneys acquisition of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise . However , the Star Wars-themed sections at Miniland USA , Legoland Florida , and other Legoland areas will close at the start of 2020 before the 2020 theme park season due to the expiration of their contract with Lucasfilm .\n20th Century Studios .\nFollowing Disneys acquisition of 21st Century Fox in March 2019 , The Simpsons became the intellectual property of Disney . Like Marvel before it , The Simpsons is represented in Universal parks , with The Simpsons Ride having operated at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida since 2008 , with accompanying themed areas based on the shows setting of Springfield .\nThe Fox acquisition also made Disney responsible for the future of Malaysias under-construction 20th Century Fox World theme park . The parks owner , Genting Group , filed a $1.75 billion lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox in November 2018 , accusing Fox of trying to back out of the deal for licensing the theme park . In the suit , Genting Malaysia alleges that Fox has taken steps to cancel the contract . The suit also names Disney as a defendant , contending that Disney executives , following the companys then-pending acquisition of Fox , were calling the shots on the project and that they were opposed to the park because they would have no control over its operations and that it would be adjacent to a casino , which would go against Disneys family-friendly image . Fox , in turn , referred to the suit as without merit , stating that their reasons for withdrawing from the deal were due to Genting consistently not meeting agreed-upon deadlines for several years and that Gentings attempts to blame Disney for Foxs default were made up . In July 2019 , it was announced that Fox and Genting had settled their respective lawsuits . As part of the deal , Genting would be given a license to use certain Fox intellectual properties and that non-Fox intellectual property would make up the rest of the attractions in the park . The outdoor park would also no longer be referred to as 20th Century Fox World , but instead would be named Genting SkyWorlds .\nAdaptations .\nWhile Disney Parks generally adapt movies into rides , some Disney theme park attractions have been adapted into or have served inspiration for films , books , comic books , and television pilots . Disney entered the television field with a network TV show named after Disneyland ( which was then its only park , and was being built at the time ) , in order to fund the park . In this series , some episodes featured the park or a park attraction . The Walt Disney Company pioneered and is the only film company and theme park company to have converted theme park attractions to film productions . However , lackluster results were achieved for most of these films except for the Pirates of the Caribbean series . Walt Disney Pictures produced two Pirates of the Caribbean sequels in 2006 and 2011 that made over a billion-dollar at the box office .\nAt first , Disney had merely dabbled with this type of film . Disney Telefilms made the first movie-based-on-ride , Tower of Terror , for the Wonderful World of Disney anthology television series in 1997 . In 2000 , Touchstone Pictures made Mission to Mars based on the closed ride of the same name .\nWalt Disney Pictures took the Country Bear Jamboree attraction and made it into The Country Bears in 2002 . In 2003 , Walt Disney Pictures issued two ride-based films in and The Haunted Mansion . Pirates of the Caribbean launched a film series and a franchise .

The first novel of the series , Disney after Dark , was released in 2005 . A five-book series was laid out by Pearson , but was extended to seven with the first books success .\nWith the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise as Disney Pictures top franchise , the company had been looking for additional projects in this category for a decade . Disney Pictures took another push at additional adaptations in the 2010s . By November 2010 , Jon Favreau had been tapped to develop the Magic Kingdom park into a Night at the Museum like film , with Strike Entertainment signed on to produce it after a script by Ronald D . Moore was turned down . Another Haunted Mansion film was in the works with Guillermo del Toro as of August 2012 . Mr . Toads Wild Ride ride film was in the works at Disney Pictures by January 2013 . Tomorrowland , first to be loosely based on a theme park area , was announced in January 2013 for a December 2014 release . Also in 2013 , American Broadcasting Company had ordered a pilot based on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad . Its A Small World was added to the list of known projects in April 2014 . Tower of Terror was given a theatrical treatment by John August under producer Jim Whitaker in October 2015 , while the long-in-production Jungle Cruise gained an actor .\nMarvel Worldwide with Disney announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first comic book title under their joint Disney Kingdoms imprint . Running for six miniseries , Disney Kingdoms would feature adaptations of the unbuilt Museum of the Weird , two serials about Figment and Dreamfinder from Epcots Journey into Imagination , Big Thunder Mountain Railroad , the Haunted Mansion , and Walt Disneys Enchanted Tiki Room . Disney Publishing Worldwides revived Disney Comics imprint first publication was the Space Mountain graphic novel released on May 7 , 2014 and based on the same name park attraction .\nOn March 31 , 2015 , the first novel in The Kingdom Keepers sequel trilogy series was released .\nIn May 2017 , Freeform cable channel aired a special documentary , Disneys Fairy Tale Weddings , based on the services provided by Disney Parks and Resorts unit , Disneys Fairy Tale Weddings & Honeymoons .

However , another special , Holiday Magic , was aired on December 11 , 2017 with the now six episode regular series starting on June 11 , 2018 .\nOther ventures .\nDisney Signature Experiences .\nDisney Signature Experiences division , formerly called Disney Cruise Line & New Vacation Operations , holds newer non-theme park travel units under president Thomas Mazloum .\nIn February 2009 , Tom McAlpin left the Disney Cruise Line presidency and was replaced by Karl Holz as president of both Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations . New Vacation Operations included the Adventures by Disney . The cruise line ordered three ships of a new class of ship , Triton , in 2016 and 2017 . In April 2017 , it was announced that Karl Holz would retire as president of Disney Cruise Line on February 15 , 2018 and Anthony Connelly would assumed the role of president on October 1 , 2017 .\nSoon after a March 2018 conglomerate wide reorganization that formed Disney Parks , Experiences and Products segment division , Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations was renamed Disney Signature Experiences along with a new president , Jeff Vahle . Ken Potrock was promoted from Senior Vice President and General Manager of Disney Vacation Club to President of Consumer Products in May 2018 . Disney Cruise Line purchased in early March 2019 another Bahamas destination , Lighthouse Point property on the island of Eleuthera from the Bahamas Government .\nWith the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by August 2019 , National Geographic Partners National Geographic Expeditions moved into Disney Signature Experiences .\n- Disney Cruise Line was formed in 1995 . Its fleet comprises four ships : Disney Magic ( launched 1998 ) , Disney Wonder ( 1999 ) , Disney Dream ( 2011 ) , and Disney Fantasy ( 2012 ) . Disney Cruise Line has ordered three new ships that will be completed in 2021 , 2022 and 2023 . Each ship was designed and built-in collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering .

A 16th resort , Reflections - A Disney Lakeside Lodge , is planned to open in 2022 just east of Disneys Wilderness Lodge on the former site of Disneys River Country water park .\n- Adventures by Disney , a program of all-inclusive , guided vacation tour packages offered at predominantly non-Disney sites around the world .\n- National Geographic Expeditions\n- Golden Oak Realty , Golden Oak at Walt Disney World Resort sales\nDisney Sports Enterprises .\nDisney Sports Enterprises , formerly called Disney Sports Attractions , is the unit of Disney Parks , Experiences and Products for Disneys sports functions and is made up of the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and the runDisney program .\nDSE background .\nDisney Golf facilities date back to the opening of Disney World with two golf courses , the Palm and Magnolia courses . At the time , those courses started hosting the Walt Disney World Open Invitational , an annual PGA Tour event .\nIn 1994 , Disney held the Walt Disney World Marathon , its first road race added additional races later .

As part of the deal , Arnold Palmer would redesign the Palm course . The Orlando market for golf had a glut of course from the building boom then bust making profitability a challenge for any golf course . Disney hoped that Palmers involvement and Palmer Advantage membership club would draw more attention to Disneys course . With the Osprey Ridge course sold to Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts to build a hotel , which was delayed until 2014 , the golf management company would run the course until hotel construction begins . While another golf course , the Eagle Pines , was closed several years ago to make way for a residential housing subdivision development called Golden Oak being built in 2011 .\nIn January 2013 , Ken Petrock was promoted to Disney Vacation Club and Adventures by Disney senior vice president & general manager while Tom Wolber , Disney Cruise Line senior vice president of operations , was promoted to replace Petrock at Disney Sports .

    "story": "Jean E . Sammet\nJean E . Sammet ( March 23 , 1928 – May 20 , 2017 ) was an American computer scientist who developed the FORMAC programming language in 1962 . She was also one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language .\nShe received her B.A . in Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and her M.A . in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949 . She received an honorary D.Sc . from Mount Holyoke College in 1978 .\nSammet was employed by Sperry Gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group . From 1958 to 1961 , she worked for Sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original COBOL group . She joined IBM in 1961 where she developed FORMAC , the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas . At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs . She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974 , and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979 .\nSammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation ( SICSAM ) in 1965 and was Chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN ) . She was the first female president of the ACM , from 1974 to 1976 .\nEarly life .\nJean E . Sammet was born on March 23 , 1928 in New York City . Jean and her sister Helen were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers . Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan . Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the Bronx High School of Science because it did not accept girls . Instead , Sammet attended Julia Richman High School .\nSammet chose to enroll at Mount Holyoke College based on the strength of its mathematics program . Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses , which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York . She minored in political science . After graduating from Mount Holyoke , Sammet pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois , where she received her MA in 1949 . While taking courses toward a Ph.D. , she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951 . When Sammet first encountered a computer , in 1949 at the University of Illinois , she was not impressed , considering it an obscene piece of hardware .\nIn 1951 Sammet began looking for a position in education . Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers . The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies : a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey . Sammet fought this determination , stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school . This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment .\nWork .\nIn 1951 , Sammet took a position at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a trainee actuary . She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about punched card accounting machines . Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines , but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete . She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D . in mathematics . Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at Barnard College during the 1952-1953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her .\nFrom 1953 to 1958 , Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York . She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer . Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy’s submarine program during her time there . In early January 1955 , Sammet began her life as a programmer . Sperry Gyroscope was working on a digital computer , the Sperry Electronic Digital Automatic Computer ( SPEEDAC ) and asked Sammet to be their programmer . Her first task was to write the basic loader for the SPEEDAC , which was a 20-line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary .\nSammet became the group leader of what was called an “open shop” as Sperry began hiring more programmers . The “open shop” consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines . The group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations . In 1955 Sperry Gyroscope and Remington Rand merged and became Sperry Rand . This merger allowed Sammet access to the UNIVAC I computer and Grace Hopper .\nIn fall of 1956 , Sammet taught one of the earliest graduate-level courses in computer programming in the Applied Mathematics department of Adelphi College ( now University ) on Long Island . Despite the fact that Adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time , Sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years .\nSammet decided to leave Sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point . The classified job advertisements at the time were separated by gender and Sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the men’s list and found an engineer position at Sylvania Electric Products in Needham , Massachusetts . Sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the MOBIDIC project by Carl Hammer , the person responsible for Sylvania’s software development .\nIn 1959 , Sammet and five other programmers established much of the design of the influential COBOL programming language , in a proposal written in a span of two weeks that was eventually accepted by Sylvanias U.S . government clients .\nSammet published in 1969 . The book gives an overview of 120 programming languages being used in the United States as of the late 1960s .\nTies to ACM .\nAround 1965 or 1966 , Sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on FORMAC . She was a member of ACM for a number of years but was not active until she became interested in starting a special interest group that would allow her to speak with other professionals in the field . After a couple of failed attempts at contacting the person in charge of Special Interest Groups and Special Interest Committees at ACM , Sammet contacted George Forsythe , president of ACM from 1964 to 1966 , who named her Chairperson of the Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation .\nIn order to gain interest in SICSAM , Sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and what was happening in the field at that time . She identified people at Bell Labs , Carnegie Mellon , and IBM who were in different divisions and groups . Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM . Roughly five years after SICSAM formed , there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM . Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of that kind of an activity . With assistance from those interested in SICSAM , Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966 , which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation ( SYMSAM ) .\nIn June 1966 , Tony Oettinger was elected president of ACM and Sammet was elected the Northeast Regional Representative ( 1966-1968 ) . She was also a member of the ACM Council and ACM lecturer ( 1967 , 1968 , and 1972 ) . Bernie Galler was elected president of ACM in 1968 and in August 1968 , Sammet became Chairperson of the ACM Committee on SIGs and SICs .\nIn 1971 she was elected chair of SIGPLAN . She served one year of a two-year term before resigning because she was elected vice president of ACM in 1972 . As chairperson of SIGPLAN , she organized conferences between SIGPLAN and various Special Interest Groups . Sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing .\nSammet served as vice president of ACM from June 1972 to June 1974 . Working with the president of ACM at the time , Tony Ralston , Sammet made the finances of ACM a priority . At the time of her vice presidency , ACM was almost bankrupt . Sammet convinced Ralston to hold a member-office forum prior to their annual conference . Sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that ACM had no realistic way of communicating with the membership .\nDeath .\nSammet died on May 20 , 2017 in Silver Spring , Maryland after a brief illness .\nSelected works .\n- Detailed Description of COBOL , 1960\nAwards .\n- 1975 : inducted as an Honorary Member of UPE ( the International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Sciences ) on October 8 , 1975 .\n- 1989 : Lovelace Award Recipient , Association for Women in Computing .\n- 1994 : Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery\n- 1997 : SIGPLAN Distinguished Service Award ( J.A.N .

    "story": "Igor Dodon\nIgor Dodon ( ; born 18 February 1975 ) is a Moldovan politician who previously served as the President of Moldova from 23 December 2016 to 24 December 2020 . He currently serves as the leader of the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova . He served as Minister of Trade and Economics in the governments of Vasile Tarlev and Zinaida Greceanîi from September 2006 to September 2009 and was a member of the Parliament of Moldova from 2009 to 2016 . He lost his bid for re-election in 2020 to Maia Sandu in a rematch whom he had defeated four years earlier in 2016 .\nEarly and personal life .\nIgor Dodon was born on 18 February 1975 in Sadova village in the Călărași District of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic to Nicolae ( died 2012 ) and Galina Dodon , a Romanian language teacher in his native village .\nStudies and didactic activity .\nHe graduated from the Faculty of Economics at the State Agrarian University of Moldova in 1997 , then the Faculty of Management at the Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova in 1998 . He later graduated from the Faculty of Law in economics at the International Management Institute . He obtained the scientific title of Doctor in Economic Sciences at the Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova , the Department of Banks and Stock Exchanges .\nFrom 1997 to 2005 , Dodon also carried out pedagogical activities . This is where he would meet his wife Galina in May 1995 . Thus , he holds the positions of assistant lecturer at the Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova ( Banks and Stock Exchanges Department ) , senior lecturer at the Free International University of Moldova ( Banks and Stock Exchanges Department ) , the International Institute of Management ( Finance Department ) and the State University of Moldova . Igor Dodon is also a member Examination Committees at the university graduation exams within ULIM and IIM .\nProfessional career .\nAfter graduating from educational institutions , since July 1997 Igor Dodon has been employed at the Moldovan Stock Exchange . Thus , between 1997-2001 he works as senior specialist of the Clearing Department , of the Listing Department , administrator of the Electronic Trading Systems and then , Director of the Marketing , Listing Department within the Moldovan Stock Exchange .\nBetween November 2001 and May 2005 , he served as chairman and member of the Board of Directors of the National Depository of Securities of Moldova SA . From September 2002 to May 2005 he was the chairman of the Universal Commodity Exchange of Moldova .\nBetween February 2003 - May 2005 , Igor Dodon is a member of the expert committee to the National Securities Commission of Moldova . Also , between March 2004 - May 2005 , he is also a member of the Arbitration Commission of the Stock Exchange . He publishes scientific articles in scientific journals , being the editor of the Newsletter Stock Exchange of Moldova and of the Stock Market Bulletin of the Universal Commodities Exchange Stock Exchange - Stock market quotations .\nPolitical career ( 2005-2016 ) .\nDodon was appointed to the post of Associate Minister of Trade and Economics in May 2005 , during the second Tarlev Cabinet . He assumed the position of Minister of Trade and Economics in September 2006 . He held the position until September 2009 , when the government of Zinaida Greceanîi ended . Dodon also held the post of Associate Prime Minister under Greceanîi from 2008 until 2009.<ref\nIn 2005 , the PCRM also had won the elections<ref having an open pro-European platform , with a pro-European slogan I Vote , where the European stars surrendered the hammer and sickle on the red Communist wallpaper.<ref\nIn 2007 , a trend for all political forces was to adopt a pro-European platform for the elections in 2009 . In this regard , Igor Dodon , during his work trips to Brussels , had assured the high rank European officials on how he and an entire Communist party were pro-European .\nIn September 2009 , after 8 years of governing , the Communist Party came into opposition . Igor Dodon has lost the Minister position . He became an MP in the Parliament , which was reelected in November 2010 . He had the 6th position in the PCRM list of the candidates.<ref The Communists has changed the European vector , and in 2010 they drifted to east , and self-declared as pro-Russians.<ref\nIgor Dodon , in only a year , since 2009 by 2010 , became a convinced pro Moldovan – no Europe , neither Russia . Moldova can become a contact point for different countries ; an area where first of all will interfere the economic interests of our neighbors and partners . We are in a very advantageous position in terms of the common interest of CIS and EU and this objective shall become an issue of the external policy.<ref\nLocal elections in Chișinău , 2011 .\nIn June 2011 , Dodon lost to Dorin Chirtoacă at the elections for mayor of Chișinău . He took 49.4% of the votes . The local elections have been an occasion for the Communist Party to return to power , at the least at the local authority level . During the election campaign , Igor Dodon went to Brussels where he had meetings with the European officials in order to establish the potential partnerships : I am at the working trip in Brussels , where I have several meetings in my agenda , including with the Mayors of some big towns of Belgium , with the acting Prime Minister of Belgium and some high rank officials of the European Commission .\nInside the PCRM , an internal fight had existed between Igor Dodon and Mark Tkaciuk . Dodon has had some separate opinion on some policy issues . This independence had raised some fears from Tkaciuk side , and Dodon was considered a social threat . Dodon has shown that he had an internal support , from some rayon committees of the party . An independent position of Igor Dodon , his rating within the party and in the society , his political ambitions in overtaking the power , first of the Mayor Office and then , in PCRM – all this were interpreted by Tkaciuk as a threat , the fact that made him to speed up and force the actions that led to marginalization of Dodon in PCRM , by misinforming methods in order to prevent him to be delegated at the position of the Mayor of the Capital .\nActivity within PSRM .\nIn November 2011 , Dodon left the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova ( PCRM ) citing hopes that a deal could be worked out with the ruling Alliance for European Integration to elect a president and end a constitutional crisis that had dragged on since the resignation of Vladimir Voronin in 2009 . Greceanîi and Veronica Abramciuc left at the same time . Our decision has a common and complex goal : to avoid early elections , the elections of the president of the country , reshaping of the government and political and social stability . This is the society wish , and this is what the Republic of Moldova is needed – a stability and the economic development once and for all… We left the PCRM in order to cut the Gordian knot of the hate and distrust which for the last two years made impossible any constitutional decision needed for the Republic of Moldova stability Igor Dodon has declared .\nOn 18 December 2011 , Dodon joined the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova ( PSRM ) and , at the Xth Congress of PSRM , he was elected chairman of the party .\nOn 16 March 2012 , three former communists ( Dodon , Greceanîi and Abramciuc ) voted for the Alliance for European Integration ( AIE ) candidate Nicolae Timofti as President of Moldova . Later , Dodon stated that he regretted his vote for Timofti .\nAfter he was elected as the President of Moldova , due to specifics of Moldovan law , Dodon resigned as PSRM chairman and left the party , being replaced by Zinaida Greceanîi as interim leader .\nPresidency ( 2016-2020 ) .\nDodon was sworn in on 23 December 2016 in the Palace of the Republic . Three days later , the flag of Europe that had flown next to the Moldovan flag from the building of the Moldovan presidential administration was removed . On 4 January 2017 , in the Dodon met with the President of the breakaway republic of Transnistria Vadim Krasnoselsky . This meeting was the first meeting of the leaders of Moldova and Transnistria in 8 years . In October 2017 , Dodon signed a law that provides for the reform of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova .\nAfter being elected president , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , Dodon said :\nIn 2018 , Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was the first foreign head of state to meet Dodon in Moldova . Dodon has also acted to make the Russian language mandatory in Moldovan schools .\nOn 5 May 2018 , Dodon announced a campaign , which would bring legislation into parliament , which would transition Moldova from a parliamentary republic to a presidential republic . According to the polls carried out in 2019 related to the most respected politicians of the Republic of Moldova , Igor Dodon enjoys the highest trust , ranking first among politicians in which Moldovans have the highest trust.<ref In the early years of his presidency , steps were taken to renovate the Presidential Palace in Condrița with the help of the Turkish government . Some of the renovations included a play ground for Dodons young children and a wine cellar . The renovated palace was opened on 17 October 2018 by Dodon and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan .\nOn 16 October 2018 Dodon declared that his country would be prepared to host a Pan-Orthodox Council , where the situation with the Ukraine autocephaly and the Moscow–Constantinople schism should be discussed . He also said that Moldova will remain a canonical territory of the Moscow Patriarchate . In early 2019 , President Dodon ordered a National Coordination Committee to plan national events and celebrations dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Liberation of Moldova in the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive . The events would include the restoration or reconstruction of monuments and military graves and the filming of a documentary on the offensive . At the same time , Dodon presided over the celebrations of the 660th anniversary of Moldovan statehood in early February .\nDuring the 2019 Moldovan constitutional crisis , Dodon was temporarily relieved of the powers and duties of the presidency by a Moldovan court because of the reluctance to dissolve the parliament as mandated by the Constitutional Court of Moldova in a previous ruling and replaced by the former prime minister Pavel Filip as the acting president of the country .\nIn late October , he met with Transnistrian President Krasnoselsky at his residence in Holercani ahead of the Bavaria Conference , scheduled for 4–5 November .\nIn 2020 , the he ordered the creation of a National Heraldic Commission that would look into the concept of awarding medals to war veterans in honor of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II . On 15 April , he ordered the postponement of the Victory Day celebrations to 24 August ( Liberation Day ) due to the coronavirus pandemic in Moldova .\nDodon announced his candidacy for another term on 9 September , saying he is doing it on behalf of the people . In his campaign message , he pledged to dissolve the parliament after the elections .\nSuspensions .\nOn 17 October 2017 , the Constitutional Court of Moldova decided that Dodon is temporarily unable to perform his duties for failing to swear in proposed Defence Minister Eugen Sturza .\nOn 2 January 2018 , the Constitutional Court of Moldova decided that Dodon is temporarily unable to perform his duties for failing to swear in a number of seven ministers .\nSeveral days later the Constitutional Court once again temporarily suspended Dodon , due to his veto on a bill on restricting Russian news broadcasts . This allowed the parliament to bypass his veto and enact a law restricting Russian television broadcasts . The law bans television channels from broadcasting news and analytical programs from countries that have not signed the regional agreement for the European Broadcasting Area , such as Russia .\nOn 24 September 2018 , he was again suspended from his duties for not approving the candidate for Minister of Health .\nOn 9 June 2019 , the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova decided to temporarily suspend Igor Dodon as president , and Prime Minister Pavel Filip was appointed the interim president , who signed the decree on the dissolving parliament and holding early elections on September the 6th . The document was cancelled on 11 June 2019 on the ground that it did not comply with the constitutional standards .\nForeign policy .\nSurrounding countries .\nIn January 2017 Dodon stated that Moldova would not officially recognize Crimea as Russian , stressing that we need to build friendships with Ukraine , we need to solve the Transnistrian problem . In September of that year , Ambassador of Ukraine to Moldova Ivan Hnatyshyn stated that he does not expect a visit to ( Ukrainian capital ) Kyiv by Dodon because he doesn’t respect the territorial integrity of my country . During a meeting with Bulgarian President Rumen Radev , Dodon reiterated that the Gagauz city of Taraclia , which is inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians , will not be affected his governments planned territorial administrative reform .\nThroughout his presidency , Dodon never undertook an official visit to the Romanian capital of Bucharest . In March , he announced his belief that Romanians who support the Unification of Romania and Moldova as the countrys number one enemy , going further in an interview with Radio Free Europe by saying that the Bucharest government supports any attempt at unionism . During a meeting with President Klaus Iohannis in New York City , Dodon told his Romanian counterpart that the development of Romanian relations was a key priority for his government .\nRussia .\nIgor Dodon is considered a pro-Russian politician and in favor of the federalization of Moldova , which is in line with the views of Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Kozak and his 2003 Kozak memorandum . In late September 2019 , months after the Constitutional Crisis , Dodon stated that the country had abandoned its anti-Russian stance through its partnership with the Party of Action and Solidarity led by Prime Minister Maia Sandu . In late August 2020 , he announced his plans to take the Russian COVID-19 vaccine during a visit to Russia in September-October , justifying this by saying that he has more trust in a Russian vaccine than in an American one .\nOn Europe .\nDuring a 2020 speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , he stated that we support the idea of creating a united Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok .\nOther countries .\nSpeaking in Comrat in August 2018 when referencing the countrys allies , Dodon said we have friends who are close to Gagauzia , and I believe to Moldova , as well , they are Russia and Turkey . In December 2018 , following his state visit to Israel , he reportedly said that he is considering moving the Moldovan embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . In July 2017 , he was criticized by pro-EU politicians for welcoming an official delegation of the Workers Party of Korea led by former Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong to participate in the 20th anniversary of the Moldovan Socialist Party . MP Iurie Leanca wrote , Comrade Dodon , please stop ! It’s time to become civilized and think maturely! , saying that We are in Europe , we’re supposed to be Europeans , where the values of democracy are at the basis of all states . Dodon said in his meeting that he thinks that North Korea has a huge potential for developing commercial ties , being interested in several categories of agricultural products from the Republic of Moldova , especially about the Moldovan wines .\nPosition on Transnistria .\nDodon has regularly changed his stance on the future of Transnistria . At the beginning of his presidency , he suggested that Moldova be federalized . Currently , Dodon believes that the region should receive autonomous status like Gagauzia . In relation to this , he has said the following : Pro-Russian president Igor Dodon , elected in December 2016 , has indicated that Transnistrias attempts to gain independence have failed : They either have Moldova or Ukraine to unite with . Nobody else [ ... ] . In regards to the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers , Dodon supports the Moldovan parliament on this issue .\nOn neutrality .\nOn 3 October 2017 , Dodon became the first Moldovan leader to ever hold a working meeting with commanders of units in the National Army . During this meeting , he laid out his vision for the armed forces , according to his foreign policy doctrine he instituted the previous month . The doctrine he outlined had called for a complete ban of the participation of servicement from the Moldovan National Army in overseas exercises without his consent .\nForeign visits .\nHis first two international visits were to Moscow , and Brussels . Since he took office in December 2016 he has made 47 foreign visits to 19 different countries , with 20 of those visits being to Russia . In late October 2019 , he visited Istanbul to attend the opening ceremony of Istanbul Airport as well as the ceremony for the Turkish Republics 95th anniversary . In February and September 2019 respectively , he attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany and the Seventy-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City both for the first time . During the UN visit , he referred to his attendance as a successful one during which he and his delegation were able to promote the interests and aspirations of the Republic of Moldova on the international arena . He attended the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow in June 2018 and the 2019 European Games in Minsk just over a year later . In October 2018 , he attended a summit of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie in Yerevan where he delivered a speech in the French language .\n2020 election .\nAfter the first round , he criticized the diaspora as being out of touch with the Moldovan mainland when the polls showed their preference for Maia Sandu , referring to them as in a real way , a parallel electorate for Moldova .\nOn 3 November , during the second round of the elections , while Dodon was talking about his opponent Sandu , he modified a proverb and said ( do not change the pigeon on your hand by the magpie on the fence ) , referring to himself as the pigeon . This resulted in an outbreak of memes on social media in Moldova . This has also been used as an insult by citizens opposing Dodon , including members of the diaspora , who were attacked by him earlier . Sandu responded to this by declaring that an injured pigeon came out to the press and began to chant songs of mourning and later uploaded a video to her TikTok account feeding pigeons , saying that they are not at fault .\nThe day after the elections , Dodon met with the parliamentary faction of the PSRM , thanking them for their support in campaign . During the meeting , the Socialist deputies proposed the idea of Dodon to returning to the helm of the PSRM .\nHe came under fire for not allocating to president-elect Sandu a guard from the State Protection and Guard Service , which is traditionally given to the incoming president at the instructions of the incumbent president . After Sandu was sworn in on 24 December 2020 in the Palace of the Republic , she met Dodon at the Presidential Palace , for a ceremony in which Dodon officially transferred power to her .\nPost-presidency .\nIn a telephone conversation with Deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff Dmitry Kozak , he announced that he would be visiting Russia as head of the PSRM . During his visit , negotiated the extension of the tariff-free preferential exports from Moldova to Russia . Dodon said in an interview with TASS in Moscow that he had discouraged people from pouring into the streets after the election in order to prevent a Maidan scenario in the country . He also said commenting on the election results that there will be a sobering up of a very large number of people who will understand that they were wrong . He also accused Sandu of trying to usurp power in the country . He would later declare the composition of her Supreme Security Council to be a threat to national security . During the 2021 Russian protests , he accused Western geopolitical players of trying to destabilize the situation around Russia , adding that he did not believe footage released by Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny about Putins Palace to be authentic .\nOn 6 May 2021 , he visited Minsk with Zinaida Greceanîi to unveil a monument to Moldovan Hero of the Soviet Union Ion Soltys . During the visit , he met with President Lukashenko at his private home in the capital .\nElection season .\nIn May , he , alongside former President Voronin , formed an electoral alliance known as the Electoral Bloc of Communists and Socialists , which will contest in the 2021 Moldovan parliamentary election . The announcement came as a surprise as Dodon and Voronin have accused each other of treason and political corruption .\nControversies .\nFlag change proposals .\nIn 2010 , the Party of Communists ( PCRM ) started promoting a new official flag for Moldova . In March 2012 , Igor Dodon and the Party of Socialists ( PSRM ) invited PCRM to initiate a referendum to change the national flag of Moldova from the original tricolour ( similar to Romanias , except charged with Moldovas coat of arms ) to a red-blue bicolor flag . The proposed flag is considered by the Academy of Sciences of Moldova as a pure political invention .\nIn November 2012 , Dodon posted on his Facebook profile a photo that shows him wearing clothes printed with a patch of the Russian flag , which was criticized as a sign of Dodons alleged Russophilia .\nPosition related to the annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation .\nIn October 2016 , during the presidential election campaign , Igor Dodon affirmed that Crimea , the subject of a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine , is a territory of the Russian Federation .\nExpulsion of the Turkish professors .\nIn September 2018 , seven Turkish teachers , from the Orizont High School administration have been declared undesirable by the competent bodies and expelled from country . Due to this , on 11 June 2019 , the European Court of Human Rights condemned the Republic of Moldova , and imposed the Republic of Moldova government to pay 25 thousand Euro to five of the seven Turkish citizens .\nOpposition leaders accused President Igor Dodon and the Democratic Party of Moldova , the ruling party , of intentional violations of law and human rights in order to gain benefits from Ankara authorities , including the renovation of the Presidency building from Turkeys money . The Our Party municipal councilor Ilan Cașu considered that this SISs operation was the President Dodon payment for the renovation of the Presidency building that was renovated with Turkish money . Previously , before coming to power , the ACUMs block position was based on the fact that behind the Turkish teachers expel would be Igor Dodon .

    "story": "Jorginho ( footballer , born December 1991 )\nJorge Luiz Frello Filho ( born 20 December 1991 ) , known as Jorginho , is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Chelsea and the Italy national team . He operates as a defensive midfielder or a deep-lying playmaker , also known as a “Regista” in Italian Football .\nBorn in Brazil , Jorginho moved to Italy at the age of 15 , and began his professional career with the Verona youth team , before being promoted to the senior team . During the 2010–11 season , he was sent on loan to Sambonifacese . In January 2014 , he moved to Napoli , where he soon after won the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana . He totaled 160 games for the club before a £50 million move to Chelsea in 2018 , where he won the UEFA Europa League in his first season .\nAt international level , he has represented Italy , making his senior debut in 2016 , while his competitive debut came the following year .\nEarly life .\nJorginho was born in Imbituba in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina but moved to Italy at the age of 15 . He is of Italian descent through his paternal great-great grandfather Giacomo Frello who is from Lusiana , Veneto , and earned Italian citizenship because of his grandfather , a Brazilian who holds it .\nHe has credited his mother with encouraging his love of football .\nClub career .\nHellas Verona .\nJorginho was a youth player of Hellas Verona . In June 2010 , Jorginho was loaned out to Serie C2 side , Sambonifacese , where he played his first full senior season for the Veneto club – appearing 31 times and scoring one goal whilst providing ten assists from his central midfield position .\nHe made his Verona debut on 4 September 2011 , in a match against Sassuolo as a substitute in the 76th minute .\nNapoli .\nOn 18 January 2014 , he joined Napoli in a co-ownership deal with Verona for four and a half years . On 12 February , he scored the last goal as Napoli overturned a 3–2 first-leg deficit to beat Roma and reach the 2014 Coppa Italia Final . In the final , on 3 May , Jorginho played the full 90 minutes as Napoli defeated Fiorentina 3–1 .\nIn the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana in Doha on 22 December 2014 , Jorginho entered the game against Juventus in the second half of extra time in place of Jonathan de Guzmán . He took Napolis first spot-kick in the penalty shootout , and although Gianluigi Buffon saved it , Napoli were eventually victorious . While initially struggling to get into manager Rafael Benítezs lineup , Jorginhos fortunes changed with the appointment of Maurizio Sarri who was key to his development . In 2017 Jorginho had a breakthrough season with Napoli and was integral to their Serie A title challenge .\nChelsea .\n2018–19 season .\nOn 14 July 2018 , Jorginho signed for English team Chelsea on a five-year contract on the same day as Sarri was hired at the club . He joined for a transfer fee of £50m with £7m in potential add-ons , and was assigned the number 5 shirt . According to Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis , he was previously close to joining Manchester City . Jorginho made his debut on 5 August in the 2018 FA Community Shield at Wembley Stadium against that very opponent , and was booed by City fans in Chelseas 2–0 loss . Six days later , he played his first Premier League match , in which he scored a penalty in a 3–0 win at Huddersfield Town . In Chelseas third league match of the campaign , a 2–1 win away at Newcastle United , Jorginho completed 158 passes , which was a new record for most successful passes by a Chelsea player in a single match in the Premier League , and the second all-time in the league , behind İlkay Gündoğans 167 completed passes for Manchester City against Chelsea from the prior season . Jorginho went on to break the attempted passes record in Chelseas sixth league match of the season on 23 September , attempting 180 passes in a 0–0 draw away at West Ham United , breaking the record of 173 attempted passes again set by Gündoğan in the same Manchester City–Chelsea match the year before . On 24 February 2019 , following a 0–0 draw after extra-time in the 2019 EFL Cup Final against cup holders Manchester City , Jorginho missed Chelseas first penalty in the resulting shoot-out , which ultimately saw Manchester City triumph 4–3 . On 29 May , Jorginho featured in Chelseas 4–1 victory over Arsenal in the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final .\n2019–20 season .\nIn the 2019 UEFA Super Cup against Liverpool on 14 August , Jorginho scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in extra-time an eventual 2–2 draw . The match subsequently went to a penalty shoot-out ; although Jorginho was able to net Chelseas first penalty , Liverpool ultimately won the shoot-out 5–4 . He scored his first league goal of the season , also from the penalty spot , in a 2–0 home win over Brighton & Hove Albion on 28 September . On 5 November , he scored twice from the penalty spot as Chelsea came from behind to earn a 4–4 home draw against Ajax in the Champions League .\n2020–21 season .\nJorginho scored Chelseas first goal of the season from the penalty spot in an eventual 3–1 league win against Brighton & Hove Albion on 14 September at Falmer Stadium . On 20 September , Jorginho missed his first penalty for Chelsea in the same match in which he made his 100th appearance for the club ; the game ended 2–0 to Liverpool . On 3 October , he scored two penalties as Chelsea ran out 4–0 winners at home to Crystal Palace .\nOn 29 May 2021 , Jorginho won his first-ever Champions League with Chelsea , beating Manchester City 1–0 in the final .\nInternational career .\nAs Jorginho holds both Italian and Brazilian citizenship , he was eligible to play for both the Italian and Brazilian national teams . In 2012 , he was called up for the first time for Italy U21 .\nIn 2014 , Jorginho expressed his desire to represent Italy rather than Brazil internationally , and he received his first call up to the Italy senior squad in March 2016 , under manager Antonio Conte , for the teams international friendlies against Spain and Germany . He made his international debut for Italy on 24 March , coming on as a last-minute substitute for Marco Parolo in a 1–1 draw against Spain at the Stadio Friuli in Udine . After initially being included in Contes preliminary 30-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 , on 31 May , Jorginho was later excluded from the final 23-man squad .\nIn spite of his positive club form for Napoli , Jorginho was not initially called up to the Italian side under Contes successor , Gian Piero Ventura . Although rumours circled in the media regarding the possibility of Brazils coach Tite calling Jorginho up to his squad in autumn 2017 , as he had not yet appeared for Italy in a competitive match , Jorginho denied rumours that he wanted to switch to the Brazilian national team . He later made his first competitive appearance for Italy under manager Ventura in a 0–0 home draw against Sweden on 13 November , in the second leg of the World Cup play-offs against Sweden , at the San Siro in Milan ; however , Italys 1–0 away loss in the first leg on 10 November saw Sweden advance on aggregate , meaning that Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years .\nOn 7 September 2018 , in Italys first UEFA Nations League match at home to Poland in Bologna , Jorginho scored his first international goal from the penalty spot to secure a 1–1 draw . On 8 September 2019 , he scored his second international goal , from the penalty spot once again , in a 2–1 away win over Finland , in a Euro 2020 qualifier . On 12 October , Jorginho scored his third international goal , once again from a penalty kick , in a 2–0 home win over Greece , which sealed Italys qualification for Euro 2020 . He scored his fourth international goal from the penalty spot once again on 18 November , in a 9–1 home win over Armenia in Italys final Euro 2020 qualifier , also assisting Nicolò Zaniolos second goal during the match .\nStyle of play .\nJorginho is known for his composure and versatility as a footballer , which allows him to be fielded in any midfield position . Due to his work-rate , technique , football intelligence , ability to break down possession , vision , and passing accuracy , he is usually deployed as central midfielder in a three-man midfield in a 4–3–3 formation . Although he is not imposing physically , due to his slender build and relatively short stature , he is also capable of playing both in a box-to-box role or in a defensive role as a ball winner , courtesy of his tactical intelligence , positional sense , awareness , and ability to read the game , which enables him to cover ground , press opponents further up the pitch , intercept passes , and start attacking plays after winning back the ball . However , he usually operates in a more withdrawn creative role , as a deep-lying playmaker in front of the back-line , a position known as the regista role in Italian football jargon , which allows him more time on the ball to control the tempo of his teams play with his short , precise , horizontal passing game on the ground . He is also an accurate penalty taker .\nHonours .\nNapoli\n- Coppa Italia : 2013–14\n- Supercoppa Italiana : 2014\nChelsea\n- UEFA Champions League : 2020–21\n- UEFA Europa League : 2018–19\n- FA Cup runner-up : 2019–20 , 2020–21\n- EFL Cup runner-up : 2018–19\nIndividual\n- UEFA Europa League Squad of the Season : 2018–19\n- UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season : 2020–21\nExternal links .\n- Profile at the Chelsea F.C . website\n- Profile at FIGC",

Letwin sought to extend Article 50 through passing the Cooper-Letwin Act . In August 2019 he announced that he would stand down at the next election . On 3 September 2019 , he lost the Conservative party whip and sat as an independent MP after that .\nEarly life and education .\nLetwin , who was born 19 May 1956 in London , is the son of William Letwin ( 14 December 1922 – 20 February 2013 ) , emeritus professor at the London School of Economics , and the conservative academic Shirley Robin Letwin .

It also criticised some of the schemes proposed to address inner-city problems , suggesting David Youngs proposed scheme to support black entrepreneurs would founder because the money would be spent on the disco and drug trade . Letwin later apologised , saying that parts of the memo had been both badly worded and wrong .\nLetwin co-authored Britains biggest enterprise : ideas for radical reform of the NHS , a 1988 Centre for Policy Studies pamphlet written with John Redwood which advocated a closer relationship between the National Health Service and the private sector . This is regarded as providing a theoretical justification for NHS reforms carried out by subsequent governments , particularly the Health and Social Care Act 2012 .\nLetwin stood unsuccessfully against Diane Abbott in Hackney North and Stoke Newington at the 1987 election , and against Glenda Jackson for the Hampstead and Highgate seat in the 1992 election .\nMP for West Dorset ( 1997–2019 ) .\nLetwin won the historically safe Conservative seat of West Dorset at the 1997 general election , achieving a majority of 1,840 votes over the next candidate .\nShadow Cabinet ( 2000–2010 ) .\nAs Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague appointed Letwin as a member of his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in September 2000 .

When this proposal came under attack as regressive , Letwin found few of his colleagues to defend it , and he adopted a low profile for the remainder of the campaign . He went into hiding during the 2001 election . At this election , his majority in his West Dorset constituency was cut to 1,414 votes .\nIn September 2001 , he was appointed Shadow Home Secretary by the new Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith . In this role , he attracted plaudits for his advocacy of a neighbourly society , which manifested itself in calls for street by street neighbourhood policing , modelled on the philosophy of the police in New York . He was also largely credited with forcing the then Home Secretary to withdraw his proposal in 2001 to introduce an offence of incitement to religious hatred . He successfully argued that such an offence would be impossible to define , so there would be little chance of prosecution . He also argued that Muslims would feel persecuted by such a law . In late 2003 , Michael Howard appointed Letwin as his successor as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer . As Shadow Chancellor he focused on reducing waste in the public sector .\nAt the 2005 general election the Conservative Party claimed to have found £35 billion worth of potential savings , to be used for increased resources for front-line services and for tax cuts . This approach was credited with forcing the government to introduce bureaucracy reduction and cost-cutting proposals of their own . In May 2005 , Letwins majority in his seat increased to 2,461 votes , despite his hard pro-EU views . After the election , Letwin was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs . The Times reported that he had requested a role less onerous than his former Treasury brief so that he would have time to pursue his career in the City . Until December 2009 , he was a non-executive director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild Corporate Finance Ltd .\nFollowing Michael Howards decision to stand down as Conservative Party leader after the 2005 election , Letwin publicly backed the youngest candidate and eventual winner David Cameron .\nIn the lead-up to the 2010 general election , Letwin played an important role in the development of Conservative policy , and was described by Daniel Finkelstein as the Gandalf of the process . The 2010 general election saw him increase his majority to 3,923 votes .\nCameron Premiership ( 2010–2016 ) .\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Letwin to the newly-created office of Minister of State for Government Policy in the newly-formed Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government in May 2010 . His responsibilities included developing government policies with the Cabinet Office , as set out in the Coalitions programme for government , as well as implementing departmental business plans . He also attended the Cabinet , although not as a full member or Cabinet Minister .\nLetwin was appointed as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 14 July 2014 , succeeding Lord Hill of Oareford who became the United Kingdoms next European Commissioner . He also continued in his role as Minister for Policy until the 2015 general election , when the position was abolished .\nHe was returned with a much increased majority of 16,130 votes by his West Dorset constituents at the 2015 general election . Following that election , Letwin remained Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cameron also appointed him as a full member of the new Conservative governments Cabinet with responsibility for overall charge and oversight of the Cabinet Office .\nImmediately after the 23 June 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum , Cameron appointed Letwin Minister for Brexit . He appeared on 5 July before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and was criticised for Governments lack of planning for a leave vote . Cabinet was accused of dereliction of duty . When committee chairman Crispin Blunt observed upon the resignation of Cameron that Letwin had been left holding the baby , Letwin said ,\nI can only say that the baby is being firmly held , and that my intention is that the baby should prosper – because I care about the baby in question . It is , in fact , our country .\nLetwin was awarded a knighthood by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Ministers Resignation Honours List . This gave him the honorific title Sir for life .\nMay Premiership ( 2016–2019 ) .\nThe new Prime Minister Theresa May terminated Letwins tenure as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and split the Minister for Brexit position he had held , creating the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and handing that job to arch-Leaver David Davis .\nIn 2018 , Letwin led an independent review into the delivery of housing on large development sites .\nDuring the Second May ministry in 2019 , Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold indicative votes , allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons . Though no option received a positive number of votes , the People‘s Vote proposal from Margaret Beckett was the most popular .\nExpulsion from the Conservative Party .\nIn August 2019 , Letwin announced that he would stand down at the next general election . On 3 September 2019 he proposed the Letwin motion upon the Benn bill under Standing Order No . 24 , and then , with 20 other rebel Conservative MPs , voted against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson . The rebel MPs voted for the Letwin motion to take control of parliamentary business from the government , for the purpose of introducing a bill which would prevent the Prime Ministers policy of allowing the United Kingdom to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October . The bill thus introduced the next day became the European Union ( Withdrawal ) ( No . 2 ) Act 2019 . Subsequently , all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip , expelling them as Conservative MPs and requiring them to sit as independents . If Letwin had decided to stand for re-election in a future election the party would have blocked him as a Conservative candidate , but that was immaterial for him as he had already promised in August to stand down .\nAs an independent MP .\nAfter his summary ejection from the Conservative parliamentary party , Letwin sat as an independent . On 19 October 2019 , he tabled an amendment to the Government business of the super Saturday session . His amendment passed by 322 to 306 votes . The government then deferred the vote it had planned for that day on the actual deal itself . His amendment attracted the support of ten former Conservative and ten Democratic Unionist Party members , while the government attracted the votes of six Labour MPs and seventeen independents . Eight Labour MPs , five Conservatives and one independent member did not vote on the Letwin motion . The following day , The Sunday Telegraph published a declaration from an anonymous Conservative source that Letwins motion had been masterminded by Lord Pannick , the barrister who had represented Gina Miller in her actions against the Johnson ministrys Brexit policy .\nPublic sector spending .\nLetwin maintained in June 2017 that the public is willing to increase taxes carefully for large numbers of people to pay for improved public services . Letwin said , It may well be , in one way or another , a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a little more on the crucial public services that do need more spent on them . Letwin wants to see better public services rather than higher public sector pay . Letwin believes reducing the deficit is important so Britain is protected when the next downturn comes .\nEarly controversies .\n1985 Broadwater Farm memo controversy .\nIn 1985 , Letwin and Hartley Booth wrote a five-page document as members of then-Prime Minister Thatchers policy unit in response to the widespread 1985 unrest in Britains inner cities – with riots in Broadwater Farm estates in Tottenham , North London , Handsworth , Brixton , Peckham and Toxteth . In the paper , Letwin and Booth urged Thatcher to ignore reports that rioting in mainly black urban areas was the result of social deprivation and racism . Letwin was at the time considered to be a young star of the Conservative Party . The memo scorned suggestions by senior cabinet ministers to set up a £10 million communities programme to tackle inner-city problems by helping black entrepreneurs start businesses as suggested by then-Employment Secretary David Young , refurbishing public housing council blocks as suggested by then-Environment Secretary Kenneth Baker and establishing training programmes for low-income youth .\nLetwin said it would not ameliorate the situation but would do little more than subsidise Rastafarian arts and crafts workshops stating that black entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade . When the 1985 paper was released to public record by the Cabinet Office along with other Whitehall papers under accelerated procedures of the 30 years rule into the public record through the National Archives in Kew , West London on 30 December 2015 , a chastened Letwin apologised on the same day for the offence caused .\nTrevor Phillips OBE , former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission observed that , I dont think these remarks would have raised a single eyebrow at the time .\nThe 1985 Broadwater Farm memo argued the riots were caused by bad behaviour not social conditions . The policy unit proposed a programme for creating better attitudes , including measures to encourage the establishment of old-fashioned independent schools which Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong warned in 1985 constituted social engineering .\nFormer Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the tone of the memo was positively Victorian .\nThe attitudes towards the black community exhibited in the paper are disgusting and appalling .. . The authors of this paper illustrate a complete ignorance of what was going on in our community at that time , as evidenced by their total and utter disregard of the rampant racism in the Met Police which caused the community to boil over – there is no mention of that racism in their paper .\nIn July 2014 the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe , apologised unreservedly for the shooting and the time it had taken to say sorry following an inquest into the death of Dorothy Cherry Groce , whose shooting by the Metropolitan Police triggered the riots . The jury inquest blamed the Metropolitan Police for failures that contributed to Groces death .\nAsylum seekers .\nIn 2003 , while Shadow Home Secretary , Letwin announced a policy to prevent any asylum seekers entering the UK instead suggesting a far off-shore processing centre . When questioned about where this processing centre would be , he said I havent the slightest idea yet. . He had previously suggested holding asylum seekers on prison ships for vetting by security services .\nExpenses .\nThe Daily Telegraph reported in 2009 that Letwin agreed to repay a bill for £2,145 for replacing a leaking pipe under the tennis court at his constituency home in Dorset , which he had claimed on his parliamentary expenses .\nPublic sector reform .\nSpeaking to consultancy firm KPMG on 27 July 2011 , Letwin caused controversy after stating that you cannot have innovation and excellence without real discipline and some fear on the part of the providers in the public sector . This was widely reported , with The Guardian headline stating Letwin says public sector workers need discipline and fear .\nGovernment document disposal .\nIn October 2011 the Daily Mirror reported a story that Letwin had thrown away more than 100 secret government documents in public bins in St . Jamess Park , with no real care to dispose of them properly . Enquiries made by the Information Commissioners Office found that although Letwin did not dispose of any government documents , he had in fact disposed of constituents personal and confidential letters to him and therefore did breach data protection rules . Letwin later apologised for his actions .\nPersonal life .\nLetwin married government lawyer Isabel Davidson in 1984 ; the couple have two children .\nIn 2003 , The Independent reported Letwin saying that he would go out on the streets and beg rather than send his children to the state schools in Lambeth where he and his family lived .\nHonours .\n- He was sworn in as a member of Her Majestys Most Honourable Privy Council in 2002 . This gave him the Honorific Title The Right Honourable for Life .\n- He was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II after being recommended by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Ministers Resignation Honours List .

After being frozen out of the first team squad for the first half of the 2007–08 season , Burke returned to replace the injured Nacho Novo and DaMarcus Beasley , keeping his place in the side until April 2008 , when he himself was injured in a Scottish Cup match against St Johnstone .\nCardiff City .\nAfter making just two appearances for Rangers during the first half of the 2008–09 season , Burke left the club on 9 January to sign for Football League Championship side Cardiff City on a free transfer , linking up with former Rangers teammates Gavin Rae and Ross McCormack . He made his debut on 17 January when he replaced Peter Whittingham after 45 minutes of a 1–1 draw with Birmingham City , and scored his first goal for the club on 21 April during a 2–2 draw with Charlton Athletic .\nBurke scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season on 16 September , in a 1–0 win over Reading at the Madejski Stadium . His second , two weeks later , came in a 6–1 thrashing of Derby County at the Cardiff City Stadium . In December , he scored in three consecutive matches , including winning goals against Preston North End and Middlesbrough , and on 27 March 2010 , Burke reached ten goals in all competitions with a goal against Crystal Palace , leading manager Dave Jones to describe him as being an integral part of what we do . On 23 May 2011 , Burke left Cardiff City after failing to agree a new contract .\nBirmingham City .\nOn 8 June 2011 , Burke signed a pre-contract agreement with fellow Championship club Birmingham City . He joined the club formally on a two-year deal on 1 July , having left Cardiff on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling . He made his Birmingham debut on the opening day of the season in a 2–1 defeat to Derby County , and came close to equalising in the second half when his shot after a fine solo run beat the goalkeeper but rebounded back into play off the post . Burke was part of the starting eleven in Birminghams first match in major European competition for nearly 50 years , the Europa League play-off round first leg against Portuguese club Nacional , which finished goalless . He featured in 61 of the clubs 62 competitive games as they reached the play-offs , scoring 14 goals and making 19 assists , and won the clubs Player of the Year award , as well as the Players and Junior Blues Player of the Year awards .\nAt the end of the 2012–13 season , the club took up their option to extend Burkes contract for a further year . He left the club when that contract expired .\nNottingham Forest .\nBurke signed a two-year deal with Championship club Nottingham Forest on 29 July 2014 . He scored on his debut , curling the second goal in from the edge of the box in the 30th minute of a 2–0 win over Blackpool in Forests first game of the season , and started Forests first eight league games of the new season . His second goal , in new manager Dougie Freedmans first home match in charge , was Forests second in a 3–0 win over Wigan Athletic in February 2015 , and he also scored in his next two appearances , against Lancashire clubs Blackpool and Bolton Wanderers .\nRotherham United loan .\nBurke joined fellow Championship club Rotherham United on 22 January 2016 on loan until the end of the season . He made his debut the following day against Cardiff City , and scored his first goal for the club a week later in a 4–1 defeat against Charlton Athletic .\nOn his return to Nottingham Forest , Burke was released at the end of his contract .\nRoss County .\nIn September 2016 , Burke signed a contract to the end of the 2016–17 season with Scottish Premiership club Ross County . His time there was again hampered by the effects of a virus .\nKilmarnock .\nBurke signed a one-year contract with Kilmarnock in July 2017 . On 25 October he scored a stoppage-time goal to earn his side a point in a league match away to former club Rangers . He signed a further one-year contract with Kilmarnock on 22 June 2018 . His second goal for the club came eleven months after his first : a brilliant long-range howitzer to level the scores in a home league fixture against Celtic on 23 September 2018 , which Kilmarnock won 2–1 . He scored against Rangers again on the final day of the 2018–19 Scottish Premiership season , as Killie secured third place , their highest position in over 50 years .\nInternational career .\nBurke won his first Scotland cap on 11 May 2006 as a substitute against Bulgaria in the Kirin Cup and scored twice in a 5–1 victory .\nAfter six years without international recognition , Burke was named in Gordon Strachans first squad in January 2013 . According to Strachan , Chris was fantastic in the Europa League at a good level , he has a maturity about his play now . In the international set-up you need to be able to beat people by passing or eliminating people by going past them . He can certainly do the second part and is getting better at the first . International defences are so good , you need people like that .\nHonours .\nRangers\n- Scottish Premier League : 2004–05\n- Scottish League Cup : 2007–08\nScotland\n- Kirin Cup : 2006",

Zakharov joined the Red Guards ( precursor to the Red Army ) in 1917 . He served under Kliment Voroshilov during the Russian Civil War . Zakharov graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1928 , and from Soviet General Staff Academy in 1937 ( his graduation was actually a year ahead of schedule , due to the lack of officers in the Red Army because of the explosive growth of the army , as well as Stalins purges. ) Zakharov held a number of high-ranking positions before World War II even began . In 1937 he was made the Chief of Staff of the Leningrad Military District , then in 1938–1940 he was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff , and then the Chief of Staff of the Odessa Military District .\nBy the end of 1941 , after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa , he was moved north , where he was made the Chief of Staff of the Northwestern Theatre . Soon thereafter , he was made the Chief of Staff of the Kalinin Front , a role he held for most of 1942 . In 1943 , he was made the Chief of Staff of the Steppe Front , which was renamed the 2nd Ukrainian Front around mid-year . It was in this capacity that Zakharov proved himself as one of the Soviet Union’s top military commanders . He helped plan a number of brilliant operations against German forces , first as a subordinate to Marshal Ivan Konev , and then under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky . After the cessation of hostilities with Germany , Zakharov was transferred east , where he was made the Chief of Staff of the Transbaikal Front , and helped plan the subsequent Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation .\nAfter the war , Zakharov held a number of key positions in the army . In 1945–1960 , Zakharov was the Commandant of the General Staff Academy , Deputy Chief of the General Staff , Chief Inspector of the Army , Commanding General of the Leningrad Military District and Commander in Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany . On May 8 , 1959 , Zakharov was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union . After attaining that rank , Zakharov was simultaneously made Chief of the General Staff and Deputy Minister of Defence in 1960–1963 . He then briefly went back to the General Staff Academy where he was once again the commandant until 1964 , when he was made the Deputy Minister of Defense and again Chief of the General Staff , a post he held until his retirement in 1971 .\nMarshal M .

    "story": "C . &amp ; J . Clark\nC . & J . Clark International Ltd , trading as Clarks , is a British international shoe manufacturer and retailer . It was founded in 1825 by Cyrus Clark in Street , Somerset , England – where it still has its headquarters .\nThe company has 1,400 branded stores and franchises around the world and also sells through third-party distribution . Clarks also operated concessions in Mothercare stores .\nThe company is commonly known for its Desert Boot , a distinctive ankle height boot with crepe rubber sole , usually made out of calf suede leather traditionally supplied by Charles F Stead & Co tannery in Leeds . Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark ( great-grandson of James Clark ) based on an unlined suede boot profile produced in the bazaars of Cairo and worn by British officers in the Second World War .\nFor the year ending January 2013 , the company made a profit of £150 million on sales of £1,433m making it the 31st largest private company in the United Kingdom . More than half of its £1.4bn annualised sales to January were generated abroad , and since 2010 the company has moved into India , where it now has 25 stand-alone stores , and relaunched marketing in China , where it has opened 400 outlets in partnership with local footwear retailers .\nClarks was 84% owned by the Clark family , with the remaining 16% held by employees and related institutions . In November 2020 , after a company voluntary arrangement , Clarks was rescued through a £100 million investment by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm LionRock Capital , in which the Clarks family lost overall control of the company . In January 2021 , Viva China Holdings agreed to acquire 51% of LionRock Capital , so has a substantial stake in the Clarks brand .\nHistory .\n1825–1862 – Rugs , slippers and prizes .\nOrigins of C . & J . Clark can be traced back to 1821 when Cyrus Clark ( 1801–1866 ) entered into a partnership with a Quaker cousin in the trade of fellmongering , wool-stapling and tanning in Street , Somerset . By 1825 , this partnership had been dissolved and Cyrus relocated to a site on the High Street in Street , utilising premises that belonged to his father-in-law to exploit his idea of making rugs out of sheepskins instead of pulling off the wool . C . & J . Clark recognise this as the beginning of their business and continue to occupy the site upon which Cyrus started to this very day .\nBy 1828 , as the business had grown , Cyrus appointed his younger brother James ( 1811–1906 ) as an apprentice . Educated away from Street , James was meant to be apprentice to a chemist in Bath , but successfully pleaded with his parents to let him stay in Street and help Cyrus . In 1828–1829 , whilst serving this apprenticeship , James began utilising the offcuts that were too short for making rugs to produce slippers ( known as Brown Petersburgs ) . The slippers were made using outworkers who collected materials from the factory , assembled footwear in workshops at home and returned the finished product for payment . This trade rapidly evolved , providing James with a legitimate claim to an equal partnership in the business when his apprenticeship was served in 1833 . Thereafter , it traded as C . & J . Clark .\nThe brothers developed national and international trade ( Ireland in the 1820s , Canada by the 1830s , Australia in the 1850s ) and were notably innovative , winning the gold medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851 for their gutta percha elongated galosh .\n1863–1903 – Riding the storm .\nA couple of bad years that combined volatile market conditions , a certain lack of financial rigour and questionable planning brought the business to the brink of bankruptcy in 1863 . The local Quaker community stepped in and part of the bailout deal was the nomination of James eldest son , William Stephens Clark ( 1839–1925 ) to the helm of C . & J . Clark .\nWilliam Clark put in place an accelerated repayment plan that saw indebtedness drop considerably to 1873 when he became a partner in the business with his father James . For the first time in Britain , William mechanised the shoemaking process and went on to establish C . & J . Clark both as a pioneer of new technology and as a champion of footwear innovation . James withdrew from the partnership in 1889 , to be replaced by his son Francis , Williams younger brother .\nIn line with the familys Quaker values , the capital was also extended beyond the factory to benefit social initiatives in Street : a school was founded so that young men and women could combine working in the factory with continuing their education , a theatre was opened , a library was built , along with an open-air swimming pool and town hall . Playing fields were established for the benefit of all and low-cost housing was provided by the company for its employees .\n1904–1945 – Style , technology and foot measuring .\nIn 1903 the partnership arrangement was discontinued in favour of a private limited company . This enabled the succession to the third generation of family members as children of William Stephens Clark became life directors alongside Francis and himself . Tasked with specific responsibilities , Alice Clark , John Bright Clark and Roger Clark developed distinct roles .\nBrothers John Bright and Roger Clark studied American making processes and techniques with a view to appointing a suitable candidate experienced in the American factory system that they might bring to Street . John Walter Bostock from Lynn , Massachusetts was recruited in 1904 . The implementation was a resounding success and Bostock was made a director of the company in 1928 .\nA London Office , opened in the West End in 1908 , supplemented the shoemaking knowledge with style information . A reputation for high-quality goods available in the latest fashions , was established in the early 1910s , and remained until the Second World War . A premium quality Tor range was produced on the principles of standard lines , followed by a range of affordable fashionable footwear called Wessex .\nThe company had its first national press advertisement in 1934 and entered formally into retailing in 1937 through the acquisition of Abbotts chain of shops based around London and the provinces . Peter Lord was created by Hugh Bryan Clark as a retail brand to avoid alarming agents or alerting competitors to the companys activities . It steadily evolved into a national network of stores .\nGrowing awareness that bad feet were the product of ill-fitting shoes determined Bostock to devise a new shoe fitting system based on the detailed analysis of thousands of foot measurements taken from local school children . In line with the findings the company launched its new childrens ranges in 1945 with a choice of four width fittings , simultaneously with the new Clarks foot gauge that acted as a scientific measuring instrument to aid the shop assistant .\n1946–1995 – Growth and challenges .\nExpansion of the business post-war was largely initiated by fourth-generation family members : Bancroft Clark , appointed Managing Director and Chairman in 1942 and his cousins , Anthony Clark and Peter Clothier , accountable for Sales/Marketing and Manufacturing respectively .\nThe start-up or acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities ( peaking at 17 domestic factories ) across the South West and South East of England and South Wales meant that the companys volume market share in the UK increased from 1.1 per cent in 1945 to 9 per cent by 1970 .\nForeign manufacturing was also sought through agreements with existing domestic manufacturers : Ireland in the 1930s with Australia , Canada and South Africa added in the 1940s and 1950s . Nathan Clark ( younger brother of Bancroft ) negotiated a number of these agreements in his capacity as Overseas Manager until 1952 .\nBancroft retired in 1967 . His son , Daniel Clark succeeded Peter Clothier as Managing Director in 1973 , with Anthony Clark remaining as Chairman . He retired in 1974 , when his son , Lance Clark , was appointed Managing Director of the manufacturing and wholesaling division .\nIn 1974 Clarks bought the fashionable Ravel , Pinet and Mondaine . The company acquired K Shoes , based in Kendal , Cumbria to salvage it from a hostile takeover . The closure of factories started in 1978 , and continued throughout the 1980s .\nDaniel Clark resigned in 1986 replaced by John Clothier ( son of Peter ) who remained CEO throughout the turbulent buy-out negotiations with Berisford International Plc , a properties commodities group that attempted to take the troubled company public . While the proposal was defeated by shareholders at the EGM convened on 7 May 1993 it was also decided to move away from direct family management to professional managers , who would rationalise the business , and would be more comfortable with making the changes needed for its recovery .\n1996–present : Worldwide growth and a global brand .\nThe appointment of Tim Parker as CEO in 1996 was made on the initiation of the newly elected Chairman , Roger Pedder . Clarks format was radically changed with the Act Your Shoe Size Not Your Age Campaign in 1997 , which contributed to a freshening of the brand .\nCompletion of the transition from manufacturing to a wholesaling and branded retailing business was conducted by Parkers successor , Peter Bolliger , who became CEO in 2002 . Closure of the companys remaining manufacturing interests meant that the last Clarks UK factory ceased production in 2005 followed by the last K factory in 2006 . Production was relocated off-shore , using third party factories , predominantly located in Asia .\nTransformation of retail and investment to modernise company infrastructure and systems was also completed . Street consequently remains the epicentre for company operations , a distribution facility having been constructed in the village in 2005 with the capacity to process 1 million pairs of shoes per week .\nFormer CEO , Melissa Potter , who was appointed in 2010 , re-organized the business in four regions Americas , Asia Pacific , Europe and United Kingdom & Republic of Ireland ( from February 2013 ) , the re-launch in China , the move into India , the launch of the online business and the increased focus on building a global brand .\nMelissa Potter stepped down as CEO in September 2015 . Non-executive chairman Thomas O’Neill lead the business until 2017 when Mike Shearwood was appointed as the new CEO . Then following Shearwoods resignation in June 2018 , Stella David was announced as In-term CEO . In February 2019 Giorgio Presca was announced as the new CEO , Stella David returned to her role on the board .\nIn May 2018 , the company announced that it would build a new production plant next to its headquarters in Street , Somerset . The £3 million factory would see the latest in robot technology and create 80 jobs and produce over 300,000 pairs of Desert Shoes per year .\nIn November 2020 , Clarks announced a rescue plan through a £100 million investment by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm LionRock Capital after a company voluntary arrangement ( CVA ) , a form of insolvency , in which the Clarks family will lose overall control of the company . The CVA requires the agreement of landlords , who would receive a percentage of turnover as rent , and creditors .\nIn January 2021 , Viva China Holdings has agreed to acquire 51 per cent of LionRock Capital Partners QiLe Limited , the private equity firm which will own the Clarks brand , for £51 million . The majority owner of Viva China Holdings is entrepreneur Li Ning , a former Olympic gold medal winner for China . This resulted in Victor Herrero , a Spanish executive and former CEO of Guess , being named as the new Clarks CEO in March of 2021 . Prior to his appointment as CEO , he served as a board member to Clarks since April 2019 .\nClarks Companies North America ( CCNA ) .\nThe history of C&J Clarks representation in America dates back to 1950 and the formation of Clarks of England Inc . Initiated by Bronson Davis , a car salesman , who had seen the Desert Boot at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949 . Davis established a sales organization covering 150 accounts with outlets that stocked Clarks products , predominantly Desert Boots . He also sponsored advertisements for Clarks shoes in The New Yorker and Esquire magazines .\nDavis established relations with some of Americas most prestigious retailers ; Abercrombie & Fitch , Neiman-Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue . The coverage for the Desert Boot was consolidated by advertising that targeted the campus trade of Berkeley , Cornell , Harvard , North Carolina and Yale Universities through ads in Esquire and college magazines .\nA young salesman named Robert ( Bob ) Cullerton followed Bronson Davis at the lead in America . Appointed President in April 1961 , he inherited a business focussed on the provision of mens casuals and the Desert Boot . He appointed designer Nancy Knox to create a new range advertised via Playboy and Gentlemens Quarterly .\nIn parallel with American developments , C&J Clark Ltd . acquired the Blachford Shoe Manufacturing Co . Ltd . of Toronto in 1952 , establishing a foothold in Canada led by Hugh Woods and Harold Hughes . Similarities between the businesses in Canada and North America meant Cullerton , Woods and Hughes quickly collaborated . They developed a clear vision of what womens sandals and shoes were required to supplement the demand for mens casual offerings . An Italian resourcing programme was started by Woods in 1960 to get more style and variety into the ranges .\nOffices were opened in the Empire State Building , New York in April 1964 . Sales were also buoyed by the introduction of the Wallabee in the late 1960s and expansion towards the West Coast . Wholesaling interests were complemented with retail from the late 1970s through the acquisition of Hanover Shoes Inc . who owned 220 retail shops . At the same time C&J Clark decided to bring together its North American interests under one corporation to operate Hanover , Clarks of England and Clarks Canada . The business grew further in 1979 through the acquisition of Bostonian , a well-respected mens dress shoe brand , adding 25 more shop locations as well as entry into 70 leased stores and discounting outlets . Responsibility for Clarks Canada and Clarks of England was transferred to the C&J Clarks HQ in Street in 1986 . Clarks of England and Clarks Canada officially merged in 1987 to provide more operational efficiencies and more consistency of product offering for North America .\nBob Infantino became CEO of the North American operations in 1992 , taking a key role in consolidating the manufacturing , retailing , and wholesaling activities in America into one company : Clarks Companies North America ( CCNA ) from 1995 . By 1998 , CCNA became principally a wholesaling business , serving 170 owned retail locations and 3,600 third party wholesale accounts , representing 14,200 retail outlets . Sales increased by 57 per cent from 1995 to 2001 , profits rose five-fold . Infantino left the company in 2010 , replaced by Jim Salzano who was at the helm of the North American business until 2013 , when CCNA officially became the Americas Region , one of the four regions resulting as part of the re-organization initiated by Melissa Potter . Since March 2016 Gary Champion has led the Americas Region as president , also serving on the Global Leadership Team .\nProducts .\nSchool shoes .\nIn the United Kingdom , Clarks has long been a popular choice of parents as a place to purchase school shoes for children to wear upon returning to school following the summer holidays .\nThe Independent UK newspaper ranked Clarks as the number one provider of school shoes in the United Kingdom in 2017 , highlighting that it has been providing quality shoes for over 170 years and highlighting the fact that Clarks is one of only a few manufacturers of school shoes to be provided in half sizes .\nPart of the reason , despite being long-lasting and durable , parents have opted for Clarks school shoes for their children is that almost every Clarks design of school shoes has been classed as acceptable shoes in line with most primary and secondary school uniform policies . In recent years , notably in mid–2010s , schools have reviewed their uniform policies and have instead identified a few of Clarks designs for school shoes as being unacceptable and not complying with the school uniform policy of the school .\nIn 2016 , nationwide attention was gathered after 12-year-old Alfie Ingerfeild from Bristol was sent home from school at the beginning of the new school term in September after wearing a pair of Harlem Spin shoes from Clarks Bootleg school shoe range . The school , Mangotsfield School , claimed that the Harlem Spin design was too much like trainers and therefore classed them as unacceptable and not complying with the school uniform policy , so much so to the extent that the Deputy Head Teacher of Mangotsfield School said that should the shoes be worn the following school then the pupil would be asked to remove them and forced to wear shoes from lost property . This is despite the fact that the Harlem Spin shoes were advertised by Clarks as being school shoes – Clarks did not give a statement in regards to the incident and questions over the design of the Harlem Spin shoes .\nIn 2017 , a particular style of Mary Jane shoes called Dolly Babe was compared unfavourably to Clarks own Leader school shoe for boys , with parents and ministers both accusing the company of sexism and gender stereotypes – the Mary Janes in question being viewed as flimsy and stereotypically feminine with a heart-print insole and a heart-shaped charm on the toe box while the boys shoe was seen as sturdier . The company soon apologised over the matter and withdrew the shoe from sale . Clarks also issued a statement saying it would commit to designing gender-neutral footwear following customer feedback .\nIn March 2018 , two pupils from Kearsley Academy were sent home from school due to their school shoes , both purchased from Clarks , for looking too much like trainers . The shoes in question were both purchased from Clarks Bootleg range , a designated brand of school shoes from Clarks marketed for older children and teenagers .\nJoyance sandal .\nDuring the 20th century , Clarks established a reputation for quality childrens footwear . The crepe rubber soled Joyance T-bar sandal for both boys and girls was one of their most popular designs . Launched in 1933 , it continued in production until 1972 .\nDesert Boot .\nThe companys best-known product is the Desert Boot – a distinctive ankle height boot with crepe sole usually made out of calf suede leather traditionally supplied by Charles F Stead & Co tannery in Leeds . Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark ( great-grandson of James Clark ) .\nNathan Clark was an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps posted to Burma in 1941 with orders to help establish a supply route from Rangoon to the Chinese forces at Chongqing whilst also launching a series of offensives throughout South East Asia . Before leaving home his brother Bancroft had given him the mission to gather any information on footwear that might be of use to the company whilst he was travelling the world . The Desert Boot was the result of this mission .\nHis discovery of the Desert Boot was made either at Staff College in 1944 or on leave in Kashmir where three divisions of the old Eighth Army ( transferred to the Far East from North Africa ) were wearing ankle-high suede boots manufactured in the bazaars of Cairo . Nathan sent sketches and rough patterns back to Bancroft , but no trials were made until after he returned to Street and cut the patterns himself .\nThe Desert Boot was cut on the mens Guernsey Sandal last and sampled in a neutral beige-grey 2mm chrome bend split suede . The companys Stock Committee reacted badly to the sample and dismissed the idea as it would never sell . It was only in his capacity as Overseas Development Manager that Nathan had any success with the shoe after introducing it to Oskar Schoefler ( Fashion Editor , Esquire Magazine ) at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949 . He gave them substantial editorial credits with colour photographs in Esquire in early 1950 . Bronson Davies subsequently saw these articles and applied to represent the company in selling them across the US , long before they were available in the UK . The Desert Boot was initially sold in Britain through shops in Regent Street , featuring a Union Jack sewn into the label , targeted at tourists . Lance Clark is widely credited with popularising them in Europe during the 1960s .\nThe Desert Boot have been manufactured at Shepton Mallet , small scale production having initially occurred at Street . During the course of time , Whitecross factory in Weston-Super-Mare was subcontracted to relieve Shepton factory of the manufacture of the Desert Boot , before the Bushacre factory at Locking Road , Weston-Super-Mare was constructed in 1958 . The Desert Boot was manufactured there until the closure of the factory in 2001 .\nClarks announced in July 2017 , it was restarting manufacturing Desert Boots , using a new manufacturing unit featuring robot-assisted technology , at its headquarters in Street , Somerset . Up to 300,000 pairs a year of desert boots were to be made at the unit , creating up to eighty technical and managerial jobs . However , in January 2019 the company announced that this unit was to be closed , after failing to meet production targets .\nWallabee .\nProduced by Clarks from 1967 and based on a moccasin called the Grashopper , launched in 1964 , by the German company Sioux , the Wallabee brand was manufactured at the Padmore and Barnes factory based in Kilkenny , Ireland , which Clarks had acquired in 1963 and continued to operate until its closure in 1987 , when it was the subject of a management buy-out . Managed by Lance Clark who was responsible for having negotiated the licence to produce the shoes in Kilkenny and arranged for the factory staff to be trained in the production of moccasin shoes , the product took off once the decision was taken to market it in North America in 1968 . As General Manager of the factory , Paddy Roberts took the shoe to a trade fair in New York in the same year , whereupon he quickly learnt that the trademark Grasshopper had been licensed . In conjunction with Jack Rose-Smith ( Clarks Overseas Shoes Export Manager ) , Bob Cullerton ( the President for Clarks in America/Clarks of England ) , Hugh Woods ( Managing Director of Clarks Canada ) , Roberts trademarked the name Wallabee .\nDesert Trek .\nAnother style associated with the Lance Clark who had seen a Zwartjes version of the shoe on the feet of artist , Sonja Landweer in the late 1960s . An artist in residence at the Kilkenny Design Workshops , where she had come into contact with Lance Clark , Landweers shoes became the basis for production of the Trek which was first attempted at Clarks factory in Dundalk . This was more attuned to the construction of stitch-down footwear . The shoe was initially launched in North America in 1971 as Trek , before featuring in the UK range in 1972 where it was renamed Hike , owing to an existing footwear trademark . The Trek man that first featured on the shoe was drafted by Lance Clark and refined by the advertising manager in Dundalk , Bob Patten .\nPopular culture .\nSome Clarks styles ( particularly the Desert Boot , Wallabee & Desert Trek ) were widely adopted as cultural icons by different subcultures and featured in songs as well as popular films and TV series .\nJamaica .\nThe most referenced is the popularity of the Clarks shoes in Jamaica and the association with the Jamaican rude boys movement .\nAccording to DJ , producer and cultural historian Al Fingers in his book , Clarks in Jamaica , this trend started in the late 1960s when the emerging youth culture of the recently independent Jamaica adopted the Clarks shoes as part of their uniform . The original gangster rude boy dem , a Clarks dem wear , producer Jah Thomas tells Fingers in the book . And in Jamaica a rude boy him nah wear cheap ting . Writes Fingers , In the early 70s , the rude boy/desert boot association became so strong that young males risked a beating by police simply for wearing a pair . You must be a thief , the police would say . How else would you afford such expensive Clarks ? He tells the story of an infamous Kingston police officer called Joe Williams , who carried out a raid on a dance being run by producer and label boss Sir Coxsone Dodd . The DJ Dennis Alcapone recalls the arrival of Superintendent Williams : He tell the DJ to turn the sound down , and he say : All whos wearing Clarks booty , stand on that side of the dance . And whos not wearing Clarks booty stand on this side . Because he knows that rude boys wear them , so that is a way of identifying them .\nReggae and dancehall stars Dillinger , Trinity , Ranking Joe , Scorcher , Little John , Super Cat and countless others had sung about Clarks in the past . Some of the most famous songs written about the Clarks shoes in Jamaica are Little Johns Clarks Booty and Vybz Kartels Clarks ( over 2.6 million hits on YouTube ) .\nMods .\nWhile the Clarks Desert Boots became fashionable in the Beatnik Culture in the US , they became popular with youth in the UK after being adopted by Sixties Mods who wore them as part of both smart and casual clothing outfits . While the shoes are appropriate for a unisex look , they were particularly popular with male mods who wore them with military parkas , tailor-made suits with narrow lapels ( sometimes made of mohair ) , thin ties , button-down collar shirts , and wool or cashmere jumpers .\nParis riots .\nThe joint influences of the Beatniks and Mods made the Clarks Desert Boots ( Les Clarks ) popular among the Parisian students who wore them during the 1968 riots .\nThe Clarks Desert Boots carried on through to the Mod Revival era of the Seventies and Eighties becoming a true Retro Mod Classic . They famously featured quite heavily in the 1979 Quadrophenia , Franc Roddams film adaptation of the Whos rock opera influencing in turn the Britpop movement of the 1990s .\nRappers .\nThe Clarks Wallabees in particular were adopted in recent times by the American rapper community . Their appeal can be traced to a wave of Jamaican immigrants who came to New York in the 1970s and paired Clarks shoes with suits . African-Americans saw it as an alternative to sneakers and jeans and incorporated it into their look , said Slick Rick , a rapper , whose parents were born in Jamaica and later moved to the Bronx . Its a way to be casual but not look like a scrub . The ladies like that .\nThe shoe was long a staple of fashionable West Indians in New York City but towards the 1990s had fallen out of favor in hip-hop circles who tended to gravitate toward Timberland boots or sneakers . The rebirth of the Clarks Wallabees as a cool staple from mid-late 1990s is linked with New York-based hip-hop group the Wu-Tang Clan . Wu members ( RZA , GZA , Method Man , Raekwon , Ghostface Killah , Inspectah Deck , U-God , Masta Killa , and the late Ol Dirty Bastard ) and in particular Raekwon and Ghostface Killah wore Wallabees because not only they found them aesthetically pleasing but also since no other rapper was wearing them , they showed that they werent victims of the trends . They even featured the name of the shoe in the lyrics of several songs , engendering a revival of the Wallabees as a hip-hop staple by the mid-late 1990s . This justified Ghostface Killah to call himself Wally Champ and feature custom-dyed Wallabee shoes on the cover of his 1996 Ironman album . His 2008 compilation album was also called The Wallabee Champ .\nBreaking Bad .\nIn the cult TV series , Breaking Bad , lead character Walter White ( played by Bryan Cranston ) morphs from a bland high school chemistry teacher into an all-powerful drug kingpin with trademark pork pie hat , black sunglasses and goatee , but he still wears Wallabees , just about the only shoe he wears from the beginning of the five-season series until its completion .\nHeritage .\nThe Shoe Museum was established in 1950 by Laurence Barber at 40 High Street near the Clarks headquarters in Street , Somerset . Today the museum displays some 1,500 shoes as well as related exhibits , describing the development of shoes from Roman times and especially detailing the growth of Clarks shoes and shoemaking in Somerset . In 2002 , a charity called the Alfred Gillett Trust was established to care for the archives and collections of C&J Clark Ltd and the Clark family . Working closely with The Shoe Museum , the trusts collections include family and business archives , catalogues and sale materials , artwork and furniture , costume , film and sound archives , historic shoes and shoe making machinery . The trust is named after Alfred Gillett , a cousin of the companys founders and an amateur paleontologist ; some of his fossils are included in the trusts collection . The trust is based at The Grange , a Grade II listed building close to the museum in Street .",

    "story": "Helle Thorning-Schmidt\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt ( ; born 14 December 1966 ) is a Danish retired politician who served as the 26th Prime Minister of Denmark from 2011 to 2015 , and Leader of the Social Democrats from 2005 to 2015 . She is the first woman to hold each post . Following defeat in 2015 , she announced that she would step down as both Danish Prime Minister and Social Democratic party leader . Ending her political career in April 2016 , she was the chief executive of the NGO Save the Children until June 2019 .\nThorning-Schmidt served as a Member of the European Parliament for Denmark from 1999 to 2004 before being elected to the Danish Parliament in 2005 . She was elected to replace Mogens Lykketoft as Leader of the Social Democrats after the 2005 parliamentary election , leading her party through the 2007 parliamentary election , which was won by the centre-right alliance , and the 2011 parliamentary election , after which she was appointed Prime Minister by Queen Margrethe II . Thorning-Schmidt holds degrees in political science from the University of Copenhagen and a graduate degree from the College of Europe .\nEarly life and education .\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt was born in Rødovre to Holger Thorning-Schmidt , a lecturer in mathematics and national economics at the University of Copenhagen , and his wife Grete . Her father was politically conservative and she grew up in the Copenhagen suburb of Ishøj . She attended Ishøj Gymnasium from which she graduated in 1985 . Her parents divorced when she was 10 years old .\nThorning-Schmidt studied political science at University of Copenhagen , earning a cand.scient.pol . degree in 1994 . She also holds a masters degree in European studies specialising in policy and public administration from the College of Europe in Bruges , Belgium , where she studied from 1992 to 1993 ( she is an alumna of the Charles IV promotion ) . At the time , Denmark had a quota administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of one student at this prestigious institution , and Thorning-Schmidt was selected . In addition to her native Danish , she speaks fluent English and French .\nShe became a social democrat during her studies in Belgium and joined the Social Democratic Party in 1993 .\nPolitical career .\nEuropean Parliament .\nFrom 1994 to 1997 , Thorning-Schmidt led the secretariat of the Danish delegation of Social Democrats in the European Parliament . After her time in Brussels she worked as an international consultant with the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions until being elected MEP in 1999 .\nThorning-Schmidt was elected to the European Parliament as a member of the Party of European Socialists . During the five-year term , she was a member of the Employment and Social Committee and served as a substitute on the Constitutional Committee . She co-founded the Campaign for Parliament Reform ( CPR ) .\nMember of the Folketing .\nIn the 2005 Danish parliamentary election Thorning-Schmidt was elected to the Folketing .\nAfter the defeat in the 2005 election , in which the Social Democrats lost five seats and failed to regain the majority it had lost in the 2001 election , former Minister of Finance and party leader Mogens Lykketoft resigned his post , taking responsibility for the poor election results . In his speech of resignation on election night , 8 February 2005 , he called for a leadership election in order to determine who should lead the party into the next election .\nThorning-Schmidt campaigned for the party leadership as a moderate candidate and was elected by the party members on 12 April 2005 , ahead of the other candidate , Frank Jensen . She led the Social Democrats in the 2007 election , in which her party suffered modest losses and was forced into a third term in opposition . The party was also unable to regain its position as the largest party in the Folketing .\nShe was against holding a referendum on the European Reform Treaty . During her 2007 campaign she promised to relax restrictions on asylum seekers and immigrants . She also opposed tax cuts announced by Anders Fogh Rasmussen , instead stating she would like to see more funding for welfare . The party also campaigned on a platform of combating increased inequalities in society , and fighting global warming by supplying 45% of Denmarks energy from renewable sources by 2025 .\nAlthough her party again lost two seats in the 2007 election reducing the total to 45 seats , her leadership was not questioned by her party . In June 2008 , according to a Gallup poll , the opposition centre-left was at 49.8% compared to 49.6% for the centre-right . This would leave the centre-left with 88 seats , two short of a majority , discounting the Faroe Island and Greenland seats . Since late 2009 the opposition enjoyed large majorities in the polls , and according to polls carried out in January 2011 the opposition led the governing coalition under Lars Løkke Rasmussen by 5–7 points and the Social Democrats led Venstre by 7–10 points which would make the Social Democrats the largest party by far in the Folketing .\nBoth Margrethe Vestager ( Social Liberal Party ) and Villy Søvndal ( Socialist Peoples Party ) have pledged their support to Thorning-Schmidt after a potential election victory . After the last election Helle Thorning-Schmidt started working towards forming a centre-left government coalition consisting of the Socialist Peoples Party and the Social Liberal Party with parliamentary support from the small Red-Green Alliance . As the leader of the largest opposition party in Denmark , she was described by the media as the leader of the Danish opposition .\nPrime Minister of Denmark .\n2011 Danish election .\nIn the 2011 parliamentary election , she was re-elected to parliament . Although the ruling Liberal Party became the largest party and gained a seat and the Social Democrats lost a seat , the opposition parties combined obtained more seats than the government coalition . Her four-party bloc gained a majority of 89 seats in the 179-seat parliament against 86 for the sitting Prime Minister and his center-right parliamentary supporters . Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen formally tendered his resignation to Queen Margrethe on 16 September 2011 . Rasmussens cabinet remained in office as a caretaker government until 3 October , when Helle Thorning-Schmidt was appointed Prime Minister by the Queen following negotiations with the other opposition parties .\nFirst Cabinet .\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt officially began her first term as Prime Minister on 3 October 2011 , after having presented her cabinet to the Queen and having received her official appointment . Thorning-Schmidt has pursued a centrist compromise agenda , building several reforms with support from both sides of the Folketing . This has caused friction with the supporting Red-Green Alliance , which has been kept outside of influence .\nThorning-Schmidt presided over the successful conclusion of NATOs strike missions in Libya , to which Denmark was a contributor , less than three weeks after taking office .\nDuring the first year in office her government rolled back anti-immigration legislation enacted by the previous government , and passed a tax-reform with support from the liberal-conservative opposition . The tax reform raised the top tax threshold , effectively lowering tax rates for high income earners . The aim of the tax reform has been to increase labour output to fend off a projected shortage within the next decades . The stated goal is to entice Danes to work more in order to compensate for the decreasing workforce , by lowering tax on wages and gradually lowering welfare payments to those outside of the labour market to increase the economic benefit of working relative to receiving welfare . Despite effectively lowering tax rates on high income earners , tax revenue continued to increase from 831,172 million Krone in 2011 , to 901,001 million Krone in 2013 , and eventually reached 954,473 million Krone in 2015 by the end of her time in office . These effective reductions were in line with the 2009 tax reforms of Anders Fogh Rasmussen , a Venstre prime minister preceding her , which is likely why she received liberal-conservative support .\nOn 9 August and 12 December 2013 , amid tensions between coalition partners , Thorning-Schmidt made cabinet reshuffles .\nSecond Cabinet .\nOn 30 January 2014 , the Socialist Peoples Party announced their departure from Thorning-Schmidts government due to a conflict over the proposed sale of DONG Energy shares to Goldman Sachs . Before departure , they also announced they will support Thorning-Schmidt although not being a part of her government .\nThorning-Schmidt led her party into the 2015 general election in which her party increased its share of votes and seats . However , the Social Liberals lost nine seats , leaving the left bloc without enough support to remain in office . Within an hour of the results being declared , she announced her resignation as both Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats .\nElectoral history .\nThorning has been the leader of the Social Democrats through seven electoral campaigns .\nLife after politics .\nHaving lost the Danish general election of 2015 , Thorning-Schmidt stepped down as Prime Minister and as leader of the Social Democratic Party . It was announced that she would become her partys member of the Presidium of the Folketing , and she currently serves as the Presidiums 1st Vice-President . On 4 September 2015 , Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced that the Danish government had nominated Thorning-Schmidt as Denmarks official candidate to the position as new United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .\nAfter her retirement from Danish politics , Thorning-Schmidt served as the CEO of Save the Children from 2016 until 2019 .\nFollowing the resignation of Ghassan Salamé as head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya ( UNSMIL ) in 2020 , the American Government proposed Thorning-Schmidt as special envoy to focus on mediating peace in Libya ; according to media reports , however , she withdrew herself shortly after .\nIn May 2020 , Thorning-Schmidt joined the Facebook Oversight Group , established as an independent entity within Facebook , Inc . She was appointed as a full board member ( one of twenty ) who as a board have initially adjudicated on deleted Facebook posts in 2021 .\nAlso in 2020 , Thorning-Schmidt was appointed by the World Health Organizations Regional Office for Europe to serve as a member of the Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development , chaired by Mario Monti .\nIn addition , Thorning-Schmidt has held several other paid and unpaid positions , including :\n- Friends of Europe , Member of the Board of Trustees ( since 2020 )\n- Vestas , Member of the Board of Directors ( since 2019 )\n- DBUs Women Commission to promote womens football in Denmark , Chairperson of the commission ( since 2016 )\n- International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity ( led by Gordon Brown ) , Member ( since 2015 )\n- United Nations High-level Advisory Group for Every Woman Every Child , Member ( since 2016 )\n- International Crisis Group , Member of the Board of Trustees ( since 2016 )\n- Atlantic Council , Member of the International Advisory Board\n- Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , Member of the Global Board of Advisors\n- Scaling Up Nutrition Movement , Member of the Lead Group ( since 2016 , appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon )\n- Berggruen Institute , Member of the 21st Century Council\n- European Council on Foreign Relations ( ECFR ) , Member\n- Center for Global Development , Member of the European Advisory Group\n- Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship , Member of the Board\n- Progressives Zentrum , Member of the Circle of Friends\nPersonal life .\nThorning-Schmidt married Welsh politician Stephen Kinnock in 1996 , becoming the daughter-in-law of Neil Kinnock , former leader of the Opposition and leader of the British Labour Party and European Commissioner , and Glenys Kinnock , former British Minister for Europe . She met her husband while they were both attending the College of Europe . They have two daughters , Johanna and Camilla . Thorning-Schmidt lived in Copenhagen with their children , while her husband partly resided in Davos , Switzerland , where he worked as a director for the World Economic Forum . In 2014 , he worked for London-based Xyntéo as managing director for the Global Leadership and Technology Exchange , but was elected Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Aberavon at the 2015 United Kingdom general election . The family have been living in Kilburn , London since Thorning-Schmidt became CEO of Save the Children , whilst also spending time at Kinnocks constituency in Port Talbot . Thorning-Schmidt is also a member of the British Labour Party , and has campaigned for her husband .\nAlthough Thorning-Schmidt has been baptized into the Church of Denmark , she is not confirmed . She occasionally goes to church but does not believe in eternal life , salvation , heaven , or hell .\nControversies .\nTax affairs .\nThe Danish tax authorities ( SKAT ) investigated reports that Thorning-Schmidts husband , Stephen Kinnock , was guilty of tax evasion . Kinnock had declared that he was not a resident of Denmark and thus not subject to Danish taxes , while at the same time Thorning-Schmidt had declared , in an application for dispensation for Kinnock to own property in Denmark , that he resided in Denmark every weekend of the year from Friday through to Monday . Thorning-Schmidt attributed the discrepancy to a big and sloppy error . On 16 September 2010 , Danish tax authorities acquitted the couple and the charges of tax evasion were dropped .\nA week before 15 September 2011 elections to the Danish Parliament , the 2010 decision from SKAT ( the taxation department ) surfaced in the Danish tabloid B.T . The case had been leaked to the newspaper several months previously . It turned out that from 2000 to 2008 Thorning-Schmidt had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband , even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark . The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from 2006 to 2008 , and Thorning-Schmidt paid the amount she had saved due to the error . She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from 2000 to 2005 , because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases .\nIn November 2011 , the daily Politiken disclosed that the Tax Ministry deputy chief Peter Loft had attended several meetings attending to the Thorning-Schmidt case and had tried to insert comments into the final resolution text . This would be unlawful under Danish law as the Tax Ministry may not interfere with the decisions taken in individual tax cases . This set off a flurry of speculation in the press , as to whether there had been any political pressure from the then government to pursue a stricter course in the tax case . The Tax Minister in the new government , Thor Möger Pedersen , subsequently asked Peter Loft and the director of the revenue services Copenhagen branch , Erling Andersen , to give a report on the happenings . On 2 December , Pedersen disclosed that he had found such big discrepancies in the two reports that he would set up a commission of inquiry to determine the actual course of events .\nFurther controversy erupted when two days later the tabloid daily , Ekstra Bladet , reported that they had also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign . The source of the leak was determined to be Peter Arnfeldt , spin doctor for then Minister for Taxation Troels Lund Poulsen . This led to intense media speculation that the former government , and specifically Troels Lund Poulsen , were engaged in leaking confidential tax information and trying to pressure the revenue service into changing its decision in the case , in an active attempt to discredit the opposition leader in the then imminent election . This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life . The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously , was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in , or knew of , the leak . On the same day , Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament . Peter Arnfeldt has been reported to the police by the Ministry for Taxation . In March 2012 , Peter Loft was suspended from his post as deputy chief , for the duration of the two-year investigation period .\nSelfie controversy .\nIn December 2013 , Thorning-Schmidt , British Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama faced criticism on social media that they had behaved inappropriately after posing for a selfie taken with Thorning-Schmidts mobile phone during the memorial service for the former South African President Nelson Mandela . Defending her actions , Thorning-Schmidt said , There were lots of pictures taken that day , and I just thought it was a bit fun . Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government , we too are just people who have fun . Cameron said he was being polite when Thorning-Schmidt asked him to take part in the picture . On a previous occasion , Thorning-Schmidt had stopped her car to ask for a picture with the actress Sarah Jessica Parker after spotting her signing autographs in Oslo .\nExternal links .\n- Prime Ministers website",

    "story": "Ralph W . Hood\nRalph Wilbur Hood Jr . ( born 1942 ) is an American psychologist . He serves as Leroy A . Martin Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga , where he specializes in the psychology of religion .\nLife and career .\nHood was born on July 12 , 1942 , in Denver , Colorado . He married his wife , Betsy , in 1960 . Hood received his Bachelor of Science degree at University of California , Los Angeles ( 1964 ) , a Master of Science degree at California State College at Los Angeles ( 1966 ) , and a Doctor of Philosophy degree at University of Nevada , Reno ( 1968 ) .\nHood is a former editor of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion ( 1995–1999 ) , and has been coeditor of The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion ( 1992–1995 ) and Archiv für Religionpsychologie ( 2005– ) . Since 2014 he has been a member of the advisory board of Open Theology .\nHood was named a fellow of division 36 of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) in 1980 and served as its president in 1992 . He was awarded the Mentor Award by the division in 1996 . Hood received the William James Award from the APA in 1995 for sustained and distinguished research in the psychology of religion . He was named a fellow of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in 1994 and was awarded the societys Distinguished Service Award in 2000 .\nResearch topics .\nHoods mysticism scale ( M-scale ) , based on Walter Staces distinction between introverted and extroverted mysticism , was developed in the 1970s , and is a well-known research instrument for mystical experiences .\nHood is also well-known for studying snake handling churches in the Appalachian Mountains . In 2008 , he co-authored a highly-cited book with W . Paul Williamson covering this area of research in-depth .\nCriticism .\nStaces work in mystical experience has received strong criticisms for its lack of methodological rigor and its perennialist pre-assumptions . Major criticism came from Steven T . Katz in his influential series of publications on mysticism and philosophy and from Wayne Proudfoot in his Religious Experience ( 1985 ) . In defense of Stace , Hood ( 2001 ) cites Robert K . C . Forman , who argues that introverted mysticism is correctly conceptualized as a common core , since it lacks all content , and is the correct basis for a perennial philosophy . Hood notes that Staces work is a conceptual approach , based on textual studies . He posits his own work as a parallel approach , based on an empirical approach , thereby placing the conceptual claims in an empirical framework , assuming that Stace is correct in his approach .\nJacob van Belzen criticized Hood , noting that Hood validated the existence of a common core in mystical experiences , but based on a conceptual framework which presupposes the existence of such a common core : [ T ] he instrument used to verify Staces conceptualization of Stace is not independent of Stace , but based on him . Belzen also notes that religion does not stand on its own , but is embedded in a cultural context , which should be taken into account . To this criticism Hood et al . answer that universalistic tendencies in religious research are rooted first in inductive generalizations from cross-cultural consideration of either faith or mysticism , stating that Stace sought out texts which he recognized as an expression of mystical expression , from which he created his universal core . Hood therefore concludes that Belzen is incorrect when he claims that items were presupposed .\nPublications .\nArticles .\nHood has published numerous articles on the psychology of religion and spirituality in professional journals .\nBooks ( author ) .\n- , coauthored with Peter C . Hill and W . Paul Williamson . The book covers fundamentalism in different Christian sects , varying from Amish to Pentecostal and also investigates Islam . The authors seek to provide an experientially-based but empirically-minded psychological viewpoint on the concept of religious fundamentalism .\n- . Jimmy Morrow , a church leader and serpent handler for more than 25 years , explores his lifetime of experiences from this unique form of Christian worship and reveals its history , previously unknown outside of the small communities where these rites are practiced . Hood shares insights into the social power of these practices and explains them from within a social psychological framework .\n- . Hood has spent 15 years , along with W . Paul Williams , with snake handlers in Appalachia , learning about their belief systems , and has used this research to help build a psychological viewpoint on the phenomena of fundamentalism in religion .",

    "story": "Kevin MacDonald ( evolutionary psychologist )\nKevin B . MacDonald ( born January 24 , 1944 ) is an American anti-semitic conspiracy theorist , white supremacist , and a retired professor of evolutionary psychology at California State University , Long Beach ( CSULB ) . In 2008 , the CSULB academic senate voted to disassociate itself from MacDonalds work .\nMacDonald is known for his promotion of an antisemitic theory , most prominently within The Culture of Critique series , according to which Western Jews have tended to be politically liberal and involved in politically or sexually transgressive social , philosophical , and artistic movements , because Jews have biologically evolved to undermine the societies in which they live . In short , MacDonald argues that Jews have evolved to be highly ethnocentric , and hostile to the interests of white people . In an interview with Tablet magazine in 2020 , MacDonald said : Jews are just gonna destroy white power completely , and destroy America as a white country .\nScholars characterize MacDonalds theory as a tendentious form of circular reasoning , which assumes its conclusion to be true regardless of empirical evidence . The theory fails the basic test of any scientific theory , the criterion of falsifiability , because MacDonald refuses to provide or acknowledge any factual pattern of Jewish behavior that would tend to disprove his idea that Jews have evolved to be ethnocentric and anti-white . Other scholars in his field dismiss the theory as pseudoscience analogous to older conspiracy theories about a Jewish plot to undermine European civilization .\nMacDonalds theory has received support from his fellow antisemitic conspiracy theorists and neo-Nazi groups . He serves as editor of The Occidental Observer , which he says covers white identity , white interests , and the culture of the West . He is described by the Anti-Defamation League as having become a primary voice for anti-Semitism from far-right intellectuals and by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the neo-Nazi movements favorite academic . He has been described as part of the alt-right movement . By 2010 , MacDonald was one of the eight members of the board of directors of the newly founded American Third Position ( known from 2013 as the American Freedom Party ) , an organization stating that it exists to represent the political interests of White Americans .\nMacDonald claims a suite of traits he attributes to Jews , including higher-than-average verbal intelligence and ethnocentricism , have culturally evolved to enhance their ability to outcompete non-Jews for resources . MacDonald believes Jews are motivated by a hatred and hostility toward American Christian culture and have used this purported advantage to scheme to advance Jewish group interests and end potential antisemitism by either deliberately or inadvertently undermining the power of the European-derived Christian majorities in the Western world .\nEarly years .\nMacDonald was born in Oshkosh , Wisconsin to a Roman Catholic family . His father was a policeman and his mother was a secretary . He attended Catholic parochial schools and played basketball in high school . He entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a philosophy major and became involved in the anti-war movement , which brought him into contact with Jewish student activists .\nBetween 1970 and 1974 , he worked towards becoming a jazz pianist , spending two years in Jamaica , where he taught high school . By the late 1970s , he had left that career .\nProfessional background .\nMacDonald is the author of seven books on evolutionary theory and child development and is the author or editor of over 30 academic articles in refereed journals . He received his B.A . from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1966 , and M.S . in biology from the University of Connecticut in 1976 . In 1981 , he earned a PhD in biobehavioral sciences from the University of Connecticut , where his adviser was Benson Ginsburg , a founder of modern behavioral genetics . His thesis was on the behavioral development of wolves and resulted in two publications .\nMacDonald completed a post-doctoral fellowship with Ross Parke in the psychology department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1983 . MacDonald and Parkes work there resulted in three publications .\nMacDonald joined the Department of Psychology at California State University , Long Beach ( CSU-LB ) in 1985 , and became a full professor in 1995 . He announced his retirement at the end of 2014 .\nMacDonald served as Secretary-Archivist of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society and was elected as a member of the executive board from 1995 to 2001 . He was editor of Population and Environment from 1999 to 2004 , working with Virginia Abernethy , the previous editor , who he persuaded to join the editorial board , along with J . Philippe Rushton , both intellectual allies according to the SPLC . He is an associate editor of the journal Sexuality & Culture and makes occasional contributions to VDARE , a website focused on opposition to immigration to the United States and classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center .\nWork on ethnicity .\nJudaism and Jewish culture .\nMacDonald wrote a trilogy of books analyzing Judaism and secular Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology : A People That Shall Dwell Alone ( 1994 ) , Separation and Its Discontents ( 1998 ) , and The Culture of Critique ( 1998 ) . He proposes that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy to enhance the ability of Jews to outcompete non-Jews for resources . Using the term Jewish ethnocentrism , he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits , including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior , as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements . MacDonald says that not all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies . Separation and Its Discontents contains a chapter entitled National Socialism as an Anti-Jewish Group Evolutionary Strategy . Heidi Beirich of the SPLC in 2007 wrote that MacDonald argues that Nazism emerged as a means of opposing , to use his term , Judaism as a group evolutionary strategy . He contends Jewish group behavior created understandable hatred for Jews . Thus in MacDonalds opinion , writes Beirich:anti-Semitism , rather than being an irrational hatred for Jews , is actually a logical reaction to Jewish success . In other words , the Nazis , like many other anti-Semites , were only anti-Semitic because they were countering a genuine Jewish threat to their well-being .\nMacDonald published a series of three articles in The Occidental Quarterly on the alleged similarities between neoconservatism and other movements that he claims are Jewish-dominated . He argues that Taken as a whole , neoconservatism is an excellent illustration of the key traits behind the success of Jewish activism : ethnocentrism , intelligence and wealth , psychological intensity , and aggressiveness .\nOther ethnic groups .\nMacDonald has also written about other ethnic groups living in diaspora , such as overseas Chinese people and Assyrians .\nReception .\nIrving v Lipstadt libel trial ( 2000 ) .\nMacDonald testified in the unsuccessful libel suit brought by the Holocaust denier David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt , the only witness for Irving who spoke on his behalf willingly . Irving said MacDonald would need to be on the witness stand for three days , but his testimony only took a few hours . MacDonald was asked by Irving , who served as his own defence counsel , if he ( Irving ) was an antisemite an idea MacDonald rejected : I have had quite a few discussions with you and you almost never mentioned Jews - never in the general negative way . He was asked by the plaintiff if he perceived the Jewish community as working in a certain way in order to suppress a certain book and responded in the affirmative asserting there were several tactics the Jewish organizations have used . MacDonald was quoted as saying he was an agnostic in regards to the Holocaust , though he denied the accuracy of the quote .\nDeborah Lipstadts lawyer Richard Rampton thought MacDonalds testimony on behalf of Irving was so unsatisfactory that he did not cross examine him . MacDonald later commented in an article for the Journal of Historical Review , published by the Institute for Historical Review a Holocaust-denying organisation , that Lipstadt and Jewish groups were attempting to restrict access to Irvings work because it was against Jewish interests and agenda . On the Holocaust itself , MacDonald later said that he ha [ d ] never doubted the Holocaust took place , but because he ha [ d ] not studied its history he describe [ d ] himself as an agnostic on the subject .\nAcademic reception .\nAt the time of its release , A People That Shall Dwell Alone received mixed reviews from scholars , although his subsequent books were less well received .\nJohn Tooby , the founder of MacDonalds field of evolutionary psychology , criticized MacDonald in an article for Salon in 2000 . He wrote , MacDonalds ideas—not just on Jews—violate fundamental principles of the field . Tooby posits that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist .\nMacDonald has been accused by some academics in Policing the National Body : Sex , Race , and Criminalization of employing racial techniques of scapegoating [ that ] may have evolved in complexity from classical Nazi fascism , but the similarities [ to which ] are far from remote .\nSteven Pinker , the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University , wrote that MacDonalds work fails basic tests of scientific credibility . Pinker , while acknowledging that he had not plowed through MacDonalds trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments , and of not refuting them resoundingly enough to distance them from my own views on evolutionary psychology , states that MacDonalds theses are unable to pass the threshold of attention-worthiness or peer-approval , and contain a consistently invidious portrayal of Jews , couched in value-laden , disparaging language .\nReviewing MacDonalds Separation and Its Discontents in 2000 , Chair of Jewish Studies Zev Garber writes that MacDonald works from the assumption that the dual Torah is the blueprint of the eventual Jewish dominion over the world , and that he sees contemporary antisemitism , the Holocaust , and attacks against Israel as provoked by Jews themselves . Garber concludes that MacDonalds rambling who-is-who-isnt roundup of Jews responsible for the Jewish Problem borders on the irrational and is conducive to misrepresentation .\nIn 2001 , David Lieberman , a Holocaust researcher at Brandeis University , wrote Scholarship as an Exercise in Rhetorical Strategy : A Case Study of Kevin MacDonalds Research Techniques , a paper in which he notes that one of MacDonalds sources , Jaff Schatz , objected to how MacDonald used his writings to further his premise that Jewish self-identity validates antisemitic sentiments and actions . At issue , however , is not the quality of Schatzs research , but MacDonalds use of it , a discussion that relies less on topical expertise than on a willingness to conduct close comparative readings , Lieberman wrote . Lieberman accused MacDonald of dishonestly using lines from the work of Holocaust denier David Irving . Citing Irvings Uprising , published in 1981 for the 25th anniversary of Hungarys failed anti-Communist revolution in 1956 , MacDonald asserted in the Culture of Critique :\nThe domination of the Hungarian communist Jewish bureaucracy thus appears to have had overtones of sexual and reproductive domination of gentiles in which Jewish males were able to have disproportionate sexual access to gentile females .\nLieberman , who said that MacDonald is not a historian , debunked those assertions , concluding , ( T ) he passage offers not a shred of evidence that , as MacDonald would have it , Jewish males enjoyed disproportionate sexual access to gentile females .\nWhile most academics have not engaged MacDonald on his views about Judaism , Nathan Cofnas of the University of Oxford published a negative critique of MacDonald in the journal Human Nature in 2018 . Cofnas argued contra Pinker that scholars needed to critically engage with MacDonalds work , in part because it had proved enormously influential among antisemites . Cofnass own conclusion was that MacDonalds work relied upon misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts and that the evidence actually favors a simpler explanation of Jewish overrepresentation in intellectual movements involving Jewish high intelligence and geographic distribution .\nIn an April 2018 commentary in The Wall Street Journal , political scientist Abraham Miller wrote that MacDonalds theories about Jews were the philosophical and theoretical inspiration behind the slogan Jews will not replace us used at the 2017 white supremacist Unite the Right rally .\nCriticism by the ADL and the SPLC .\nMark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) claims of MacDonald that he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work.. . Kevin MacDonalds work is nothing but gussied-up anti-Semitism . At base it says that Jews are out to get us through their agenda.. . His work is bandied about by just about every neo-Nazi group in America .\nThe Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) includes MacDonald in its list of American extremists , Extremism in America , and wrote a report on MacDonalds views and ties . According to the ADL , his views on Jews mimic those of antisemites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries .\nHeidi Beirich wrote in an SPLC Intelligence Report in April 2007:Not since Hitlers Mein Kampf have anti-Semites had such a comprehensive reference guide to whats wrong with Jews . His work is widely advertised and touted on white supremacist websites and sold by neo-Nazi outfits like National Vanguard Books , which considers them the most important books of the last 100 years .\nMacDonald claims the SPLC has misrepresented and distorted his work .\nCSULB comments .\nA university spokeswoman stated , The university will support MacDonalds academic freedom and freedom of speech . MacDonald was initially pressured to post a disclaimer on his website : nothing on this website should be interpreted to suggest that I condone white racial superiority , genocide , Nazism , or Holocaust denial . I advocate none of these and strongly dissociate myself and my work from groups that do . Nor should my opinions be used to support discrimination against Jews or any other group . He has since removed that disclaimer . In addition , the Psychology Department in 2006 issued three statements : a Statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility in Research , a Statement on Diversity , and a Statement on Misuse of Psychologists Work .\nA spokeswoman for CSULB , said that at least two classes a year taught by all professors—including MacDonald—have student evaluations , and that some of the questions on those evaluations are open-ended , allowing students to raise any issue . Nothing has come through to suggest bias in class , she said . We dont see it . Jonathan Knight , who handles academic freedom issues for the American Association of University Professors said if there are no indications that MacDonald shares his views in class , I dont see a basis for an investigation into what goes on in his courses .\nCSULB disassociates from MacDonalds views .\nIn late 2007 , California State University–Long Beachs Department of Psychology began the process of formally disassociating itself from MacDonalds views on Judaism , which in some cases are used by publications considered to publicize neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology . The departments move followed a discussion of MacDonalds December forum presentation at meeting of the departments advisory committee that concerned his ethics and methodologies .\nLate in 2006 , a report issued by the Southern Poverty Law Center after an on-campus investigation labeled his work antisemitic and neo-Nazi propaganda , and described increasing concern about Macdonalds views by CSULB faculty members . A colleague of MacDonald , Martin Fiebert in April 2007 criticized MacDonald for bigotry and cultural insensitivity and called it troubling that MacDonalds work was being cited by white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations .\nIn an e-mail sent to the colleges Daily Forty-Niner newspaper , MacDonald said that he had already pledged not to teach about race differences in intelligence as a requirement for teaching his psychology class , and expressed that he was not happy about the disassociation . The newspaper reported that in the email , MacDonald confirmed that his books contained what the paper described as his claims that the Jewish race was having a negative effect on Western civilization . He said in an interview posted on his website by February 2008 that he had been the victim of faculty e-mail wars and tried to defend myself showing that what I was doing was scientific and rational and reasonable — and people have not responded .\nThe Department of Psychology voted to release an April 23 , 2008 statement saying , We respect and defend his right to express his views , but we affirm that they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the Department . The department expressed particular concern that Dr . MacDonalds research on Jewish culture does not adhere to the Departments explicitly stated values .\nOn May 5 , the schools academic senate issued a joint statement disassociating the school from MacDonalds antisemitic views , including specific statements from the Psychology department , the History department , the Anthropology department , the Jewish Studies program , and the Linguistics department . The statement concludes : While the Academic Senate defends Dr . Kevin MacDonalds academic freedom and freedom of speech , as it does for all faculty , it firmly and unequivocally disassociates itself from the anti-Semitic and white ethnocentric views he has expressed .\nThe senate considered but rejected the use of the word condemns in the statement .\nNon-academic affiliations .\nThe Occidental Quarterly and the NPI .\nMacDonald has contributed to The Occidental Quarterly on many occasions , a publication of the National Policy Institute , a white supremacist think tank . The Occidental Quarterly was described by the Anti-Defamation League in 2012 as a racist print publication that mimics the look and style of academic journals . The Occidental Quarterly published MacDonalds monograph , Understanding Jewish Influence : A Study in Ethnic Activism , in 2004 . Journalist Max Blumenthal reported in a 2006 article for The Nation that the work has turned MacDonald into a celebrity within white nationalist and neo-Nazi circles .\nIn October 2004 , MacDonald accepted the Jack London Literary Prize of $10,000 from The Occidental Quarterly ; the SPLC states it is a white supremacist organization . In his acceptance speech , he opined : The best way to preserve ethnic interests is to defend an ethnostate—a nation that is explicitly intended to preserve the ethnic interests of its citizens . According to MacDonald , one of the functions of such a state would be to exclude non-European immigrants who are attracted to the state by its wealth and prosperity . At the conclusion of his speech , he remarked :\nThe alternative faced by Europeans throughout the Western world is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples , many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them . Europeans promotion of their own displacement is the ultimate foolishness—an historical mistake of catastrophic proportions .\nIn November 2016 , MacDonald was a keynote speaker at an event hosted in Washington , D.C . by the National Policy Institute , which NPR described as a white nationalist think tank led by Richard B . Spencer . The event concluded with Spencer leading the chant , Hail Trump , hail our people , hail victory .\nDavid Duke .\nFormer Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke praised MacDonalds work on his website . MacDonald has appeared on Dukes radio program on multiple occasions saying he agrees with the vast majority of Dukes statements .\nWhen MacDonald won his award from The Occidental Quarterly , the ceremony was attended by David Duke ; Don Black , the founder of white supremacist site Stormfront ; Jamie Kelso , a senior moderator at Stormfront ; and the head of the neo-Nazi National Vanguard , Kevin Alfred Strom . In 2005 , Kelso told The Occidental Report that he was meeting up with MacDonald to conduct business . MacDonald is featured in the Stormfront member Brian Josts anti-immigration film , The Line in the Sand , where he blam [ ed ] Jews for destroying America by supporting immigration from developing countries .\nAmerican Freedom Party .\nIn January 2010 , it became known that MacDonald had accepted a position as one of the eight members of the board of directors of the newly founded American Third Position ( known from 2013 as the American Freedom Party ) , which states that it exists to represent the political interests of White Americans . A statement on their website reads , If current demographic trends persist , European-Americans will become a minority in America in only a few decades time . The American Third Position will not allow this to happen . To safeguard our identity and culture , and to secure an American future for our people , we will immediately put an indefinite moratorium on all immigration .\nBibliography .\n- MacDonald , K . B .

    "story": "Ayşe Sultan ( daughter of Ahmed I )\nAyşe Sultan ( ; 1605/08 – 1656/57 ) was an Ottoman princess , daughter of Sultan Ahmed I ( reign 1603–17 ) and Kösem Sultan , half-sister of Sultan Osman II ( reign 1618–22 ) and sister of Sultan Murad IV ( reign 1623–40 ) and Sultan Ibrahim ( reign 1640–48 ) of the Ottoman Empire . Ayşe is known for her many politically motivated marriages .\nLife .\nBirth .\nBorn in Constantinople , Ayşe Sultan was one of Ahmeds daughters by his favourite consort Kösem Sultan . Her birth date is variously estimated as 1605 , 1606 , or 1608 . When mentioning her and Nasuh Pashas 1612 wedding , 17th-century historian Mustafa Naima refers to Ayşe as the youngest of the princesses .\nMarriages .\nThe Ottoman princesses were normally married away , to influential Ottoman officials , by their mothers or paternal grandmothers , who had the right to arrange their marriages and arranged matches which could be of political use . They had privileges in marriage which separated them from other Muslim females : such as the right to be the only wife of their spouse , to refuse to consummate their marriage until they were ready , and to contract a divorce when they pleased . Due to many of them marrying as children and being widowed and divorced several times , often for political reasons , remarriages were very common . Ayşe and her sister , Fatma Sultan are extreme examples of this : they were married at least seven and six times , and entered into their last engagement at the ages of about 50 and 61 , respectively .\nOf the total number of Ayşes husbands , two were executed , one was assassinated and two fell in battle .\nAyşe Sultan was married firstly in 1612 to Gümülcineli Nasuh Pasha ( d . 1614 ) , Grand Vizier 1611–14 . The celebrations of their engagement and wedding ceremonies , as well as those of her sister Gevherhan Sultan and Öküz Kara Mehmed Pasha , which took place in succession over a number of months of 1611 and 1612 , were sponsored by Ahmed , and were so elaborate and extravagant that they were observed by the public as if they were festivals marking the end of wars the Sultan had promised . In July of the latter year , the little princess was taken in great pomp to her husbands palace , where he would eventually be executed in her presence , much to her distress . This palace , located opposite the quay known as Salacak in Üsküdar , she retained as her own property .\nWhile still a child , Ayşe was married secondly to Karakaş Mehmed Pasha ( d . 1621 ) , Beylerbey ( governor-general ) of Buda . However the man soon died while fighting in Osman IIs military campaign against Poland , the marriage thus lasting less than a year .\nIn 1626 her mother Kösem Sultan offered her hand in marriage to Hafız Ahmed Pasha ( 1564– 10 February 1632 ) , Grand Vizier 1625–26 , 1631–32 ; she wed the sixty-year-old man either in the same year or on 13 March 1627 .\nOnly a month after the murder of Hafiz Pasha during a Janissary revolt against her brother Murad IV , Ayşe was betrothed to Murtaza Pasha ( d . 1636 ) , beylerbey of Diyarbekir and Vizier , the nuptials though not being held until his arrival at the imperial capitol of Constantinople in 1635 .\nThis old and ailing husband she strongly disliked , according to Venetian reports , died – thus saving her from a unhappy life – during Murads military campaign against Revan , which took place in the course of the Ottoman–Safavid War ( 1623–39 ) .\nShe was next married in 1639 to Ahmed Pasha ( d.1644 ) , beylerbey of Aleppo and Damascus , and in March 1645 to Voynuk Ahmed Pasha ( d . 28 July 1649 ) , beylerbey of Adana , Vizier , Admiral of the Fleet12/22 June 1648 – 28 July 1649 .\nIn 1643 , early in the reign of her brother Ibrahim the Mad , Ayşe is recorded , like her sisters Fatma Sultan and Hanzade Sultan , as receiving the maximum daily stipend for imperial princesses of the time , namely 400 aspers ; yet , later , in circa 1647 , the three of them as well as their niece , Murads daughter Kaya Sultan , were subjected , on what was another assault of the protocol on Ibrahims part , to the indignity of subordination to his concubines . He took away their lands and jewels ( presumably to award them to his Hasekis ) , and made them serve Hümaşah Sultan , the concubine he married , by standing at attention like servants while she ate and fetching and holding the soap , basin and pitcher of water with which she washed her hands .\nBecause of what he believed was failure to serve his beloved Hümaşah properly , the Sultan then banished them to Edirne Palace .\nSome five or six years after Voynuk Ahmed Pasha died in battle , by rifle fire , during the Cretan War ( 1645–69 ) , in 1654 or 1655 , Ayşe was betrothed to rebel Ibşir Mustafa Pasha ( d . 11 May 1655 ) . Thanks to her appeal Mustafa Pasha was given the post of Grand Vizier .\nShe apparently anxiously awaited her intended husbands arrival – which he delayed for months – for she dispatched several emissaries to bring him to the capitol . Her head servant , Mercan Ağa , finally succeeded in the task , and when Ibşir and his troops reached her palace in Üsküdar she treated him and the statesmen that had come to receive him to a great banquet , like a feast of Hatem Tay , according to Evliya Çelebi . Their wedding took place on 28 February 1655 . Their life together was short , ending upon his execution .\nDeath .\nAyşe Sultan most probably died in or around 1656–1657 . She was entombed in her father Sultan Ahmed Is mausoleum in Sultan Ahmed Mosque .\nCharities .\nIn 1618 , Ayşe Sultan had a water dispenser built between what is today Okçubaşı avenue and the tram railway in Istanbul .\nDepictions in literature & popular culture .\n- Ayşe Sultan is a character in Güngör Dilmens ( 1930-2012 ) one-woman play I , Anatolia ( Ben , Anadolu ) , featuring Anatolian women from time immemorial to the early twentieth century .\n- In 2015 Turkish historical fiction TV series , an adolescent Ayşe Sultan is portrayed by Turkish actress Sude Zulal Güner .",

    "story": "Tim Wirth\nTimothy Endicott Wirth ( born September 22 , 1939 ) is an American politician from Colorado who served as a Democrat in both the United States Senate ( 1987-1993 ) and the United States House of Representatives ( 1975–1987 ) . He also served in several appointed roles in government , including as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Education during the Nixon Administration and Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs for the U.S . State Department during the Clinton Administration . From 1998 to 2013 , he served as the president of the United Nations Foundation , and currently sits on the Foundations board .\nEarly life and education .\nWirth is a graduate of Graland Country Day School ( 1954 ) in Denver , and Phillips Exeter Academy . He received his B.A . and graduate degree from Harvard University and was awarded a PhD from Stanford University in 1973 . He served as a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers .\nWirth served as a vice president of Great Western Cities Company , part of Great Western United , in 1970-1971 . The CEO of GWU was William M . White Jr. , age 31 , in 1971 , when Wirth described White and Wirth reading Future Shock and passing copies to the older generation of company directors .\nCareer .\nWirth began his political career as a White House Fellow under President Lyndon Johnson and was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Education in the Nixon Administration . In 1970 , Wirth returned to Colorado and ran successfully for the U.S . House of Representatives in 1974 , unseating incumbent Republican Donald G . Brotzman by a 52% to 48% margin . He represented Boulder and the Denver suburbs in Congress from 1975–1987 . As a first term Congressman , Wirth organized the Freshman Revolt in 1975 unseating a handful of old bull committee chairmen , and encouraging others to be more inclusive . Wirth had a number of difficult reelections during his 12 years in Congress , and raised large sums of money to get reelected . With colleagues Norman Mineta , Leon Panetta and Dick Gephardt , he was part of The Gang of Four on the House Budget Committee challenging the budget process with bipartisan budget ideas , and developing a high technology and alternative budget in 1982 .

Wirth in an interview to PBS , claimed he intentionally scheduled it on the historically hottest day of the summer and that he had the windows to the hearing room opened the night before so the air conditioning would not be working . However , in 2015 the Washington Post debunked the story , and Wirth retracted it : While I’ve heard that version of events in the past , and repeated it myself , I’ve since learned it didn’t happen .

He authored the far-reaching Colorado Wilderness Bill which became law in 1993 , and with Senator Alan Simpson ( R-WY ) he authored major legislation focused on population stabilization . Wirth also organized the Senate Task Force on the Expansion of Major League Baseball , which became a major factor in the awarding of a new expansion franchise to Denver . He chose not to run for re-election in 1992 , citing in a front page cover story in the Sunday New York Times Magazine ( August 9 , 1992 ) , frustration with the ever-increasing role of money in politics to the exclusion of focus on public policy .\nAfter Congressional service .\nFollowing two decades of elected politics , Wirth was national Co-chair of the Clinton-Gore campaign , and served in the U.S . Department of State as the first Undersecretary for Global Affairs from 1993 to 1997 .

    "story": "Yuri Orlov\nYuri Fyodorovich Orlov ( , 13 August 1924 – 27 September 2020 ) was a particle accelerator physicist , human rights activist , Soviet dissident , founder of the Moscow Helsinki Group , a founding member of the Soviet Amnesty International group , and Professor of Physics at Cornell University . He was declared a prisoner of conscience while serving nine years in prison and internal exile for monitoring the Helsinki human rights accords as a founder of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union .\nEarly career .\nYuri Orlov was born into a working-class family on 13 August 1924 and grew up in a village near Moscow . His parents were Klavdiya Petrovna Lebedeva and Fyodor Pavlovich Orlov . In March 1933 , his father died .\nFrom 1944 to 1946 , Orlov served as an officer in the Soviet army . In 1952 , he graduated from the Moscow State University and began his postgraduate studies at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics where he later worked as a physicist .\nIn 1956 , Orlov nearly lost his scientist career due to his speech at the party meeting about discussion of the report On the Personality Cult and its Consequences by Khrushchev at the 20th Congress of the CPSU . He publicly called Stalin and Beria killers who were in power and put forward the requirement of democracy on the basis of socialism . For his pro-democracy speech in 1956 , he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and fired from his job .\nWhat is the meaning of life ? That your soul may outlive your remains in something sacred and should escape decay .. . I have again looked at , added up , corrected , and sized up what I have been doing during these last years and have seen that this is good .. .\nOrlov obtained the Candidate of Sciences degree in 1958 and the Doctor of Sciences degree in 1963 . He became an expert on particle acceleration . In 1968 , he was elected a corresponding member of the Armenian Academy of Sciences after he found work at the Yerevan Physics Institute . In 1972 , he came back to Moscow and worked at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism .\nDissidence .\nIn September 1973 , when Pravda published a statement by a group of prominent academicians denouncing Andrei Sakharovs anti-patriotic activity , Orlov decided to support him , while recollecting the well memorized spells of the 1930s , in which some academicians demanded the death penalty for others already arrested ; later some of these academicians themselves were arrested ; and then third academicians , still alive , demanded the death penalty for them .\nDefending Sakharov , Orlov on 16 September 1973 wrote Open Letter to L.I . Brezhnev about the Reasons for the Intellectual Backwardness in the USSR and Proposals to Overcome It which appeared in underground samizdat circulation . The Western press published the letter in 1974 but publication in the Russian press was only in 1991 . In the early 1970s , the article by Yuri Orlov Is a Non-Totalitarian Type of Socialism Possible ? also appeared in underground samizdat circulation .\nIn 1973 , he was fired after becoming a founding member of the first Amnesty International group in the Soviet Union .\nIn May 1976 , he organized the Moscow Helsinki Group and became its chairman . Andrei Sakharov praised Orlov for systematically documenting Soviet violations of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki accords . Orlov ignored orders to disband the Moscow Helsinki Group when the KGB told him the group was illegal . The KGB head Yuri Andropov determined , The need has thus emerged to terminate the actions of Orlov , fellow Helsinki monitor Ginzburg and others once and for all , on the basis of existing law .\nArrest and trial .\nOn 10 February 1977 , Orlov was arrested . In March 1977 , Orlov published the article about his arrest The road to my arrest . In a closed trial , he was denied the right to examine evidence and to call witnesses .\nThe courtroom was filled with some 50 individuals selected by the authorities , while supporters and friends of Orlov , including Andrei Sakharov , were barred from entering because there was no room . Orlovs summation was interrupted many times by the judge and the prosecutor and by spectators who shouted spy and traitor . According to Orlovs wife Irina , hostile spectators in the courtroom applauded the sentence and shouted : You should have given him more .\nOrlov at the trial argued that he has a right to criticize the government and a right to circulate such criticism under the freedom of information provisions of the Helsinki Accords . Orlov also argued that he circulated such information for humanitarian , not subversive , reasons . On 15 May 1978 , Orlov was sentenced to seven years of a labor camp and five years internal exile for his work with the Moscow Helsinki Group .\nProtests over Orlovs trial .\nUS President Jimmy Carter expressed his concern over the severity of the sentence and the secrecy of the trial . Washington senator Henry M . Jackson said , The Orlov trial , and the Ginzburg and Shcharansky incarcerations , are dramatic cases in point when discussing Soviet breaches of law . The US National Academy of Sciences officially protested against the trial of Orlov .\nIn the summer of 1978 , 2,400 American scientists including physicists at the University of Californias Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory created Scientists for Sakharov , Orlov and Shcharansky ( SOS ) , an international movement to promote and protect the human rights of scientists . An initiator of SOS was American physicist Andrew Sessler , its chairman was Prof . Morris Pripstein . Scientists at CERN have spoken out against Orlovs imprisonment for disseminating anti-Soviet propaganda . 43 physicists have called off Soviet trips to protest his jailing .\nImprisonment and exile .\nFor a year and a half , Orlov was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison , then Perm Camp 35 and 37 . In Perm Camp 37 , he mounted three hunger strikes to make the prison authorities return his confiscated writings and notes . Two articles written by him in the camp were smuggled and published abroad . On 5 July 1983 , Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky sent the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov a letter asking for his release to Austria , but it was intentionally not answered .\nThe New York-based Helsinki Watch issued a statement about Orlovs health deterioration , He has frequent headaches and dizzy spells , resulting from an old skull injury . He suffers from kidney and prostate inflammation , low blood pressure , rheumatic pains , toothaches , insomnia and vitamin deficiency . Medical care in the labor camp is extremely inadequate . Orlov suffered from tuberculosis . He lost a good deal of weight and most of his teeth . Orlovs wife said he looked emaciated and that she was very fearful for my husbands health . The authorities are gradually killing him .\nIn 1984 , Orlov was exiled to Kobyay in Siberia and was allowed to buy a house with a garden . On 14 November 1985 , Professor George Wald raised the case of Orlov in a talk with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev who answered he had not heard of Orlov .\nDeportation and US citizenship .\nOn 30 September 1986 , the KGB proposed to expel Orlov from the Soviet Union after depriving him of his Soviet citizenship and met with approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . Orlovs discharge from Siberian exile was part of the U.S.–Soviet deal to release journalist Nicholas Daniloff . Orlovs release from exile and expulsion from the USSR lifted hopes among Westerners that the Helsinki process might finally start yielding progress . US President Jimmy Carter said , As for Orlov , were very delighted with this happy occurrence . We would like to meet with him if he comes to this country , but I dont know that he will . I have no way of knowing his plans .\nOn 10 December 1986 , Orlov was awarded the Carter-Menil Human Rights Prize of $100,000 . In 1987 , Orlov began work at Cornell University as a scientist and professor . Orlov was a visiting Fellow at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in 1988/89 . A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , Orlov studied particle accelerator design , beam interaction analysis and quantum mechanics . He has authored and co-authored numerous research papers , articles on human rights , and an autobiography , Dangerous Thoughts ( 1991 ) .\nIn 1990 , Gorbachev restored Soviet citizenship to Orlov and other 23 prominent exiles and emigres who lost the right in the period from 1966 to 1988 . Orlov told Gorbachev , I would say you have a very great power in your hands , the K.G.B. , and you should therefore carry out your reforms without fearing anyone at all . Afterward , you should liquidate the K.G.B. , because it is a cancer . On 18 July 1991 , Orlov and Elena Bonner wrote an open letter about the fact that Soviet army and special troops have been systematically deporting thousands of Armenians from Azerbaijan to Armenia .\nIn 1993 , Orlov received American citizenship .\nIn 1995 , the American Physical Society awarded him the Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service . In 2005 , he was named the first recipient of the Andrei Sakharov Prize , awarded biennially by the American Physical Society to honor scientists for exceptional work in promoting human rights . In 2020 , a few days before Orlov died , the American Physical Society awarded him the 2021 Robert R . Wilson Prize for Achievement in the Physics of Particle Accelerators for his scientific work and for embodying the spirit of scientific freedom .\nIn 2004 , Orlov expressed his opinion about Russia and Vladimir Putin by saying , Russia is flying backwards in time . Putin is like Stalin , and he speaks in the language of the thug , the mafia . On 24 March 2005 , Orlov wrote a letter to Putin to express disquiet over the criminal prosecution of Anna Mikhalchuk , Yuri Samodurov , and Ludmila Vasilovskaya in the case concerning the Sakharov Museum .\nOrlov participated in two documentaries about the Soviet dissident movement , They Chose Freedom in 2005 , and Parallels , Events , People in 2014 . He was a member of the Human Rights Watch Asia Advisory and Academic Freedom Committees , and member of the Honorary 25th Anniversary Committee , Global Rights .\nOrlov died on 27 September 2020 , aged 96 .\nFurther reading .\n- Yuri Orlov Cornell University Homepage",

    "story": "Teodor Atanasiu\nTeodor Atanasiu ( ; born 23 September 1962 ) is a Romanian engineer and politician . A member of the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) , he was Minister of National Defence in the Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu cabinet from December 2004 to October 2006 . He was a member of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies for Alba County from 2008 to 2016 .\nHe and his first wife had one daughter before divorcing in 2005 after twenty years of marriage . Soon afterward , he married Laura Bișboacă , a 25-year-old employee of the Alba County Council whom Atanasiu brought to Bucharest as an adviser at the Defence Ministry after being named to head that institution . The two married shortly thereafter , and have one daughter . Atanasiu later drew controversy for having Bișboacăs brother hired at the Agriculture Ministry ( then controlled by a PNL colleague ) and at the Authority for State Assets Recovery once Atanasiu was in charge there ; as well as giving out jobs to his best man and business partner and to a business partner of his wifes .\nBiography .\nEarly career .\nHe was born in Cugir , Alba County and from 1982 to 1987 attended the Vehicle Construction Technology section of the Technical University of Cluj-Napocas Mechanics Faculty . From 1987 to 1995 , he was an engineer at the mechanical plant in his native town , serving as chief of production from 1995 to 1996 and as director from 1997 to 2001 . From 1994 to 1996 , he belonged to the administrative council of another factory there , while heading a water company in Alba Iulia from 1996 to 1997 . From 1997 to 2000 , he was on the administrative council of the former State Property Fund , and from 2001 to June 2004 , he administered a Dinu Patriciu-owned , Rompetrol subsidiary , pipe manufacturer in Sibiu .\nAtanasiu entered politics shortly after the 1989 Revolution , joining the PNL in February 1990 . From the following month until 1992 , he was secretary of the partys Cugir organisation , and its president from 1992 to 1993 . Since 1993 , he has been president of the Alba County PNL chapter . From 1992 to 1996 , he was a member of the Cugir town council , and in 1996 joined the Alba County Council , of which he was president from June to December 2004 . He was on the PNLs permanent central bureau from 2001 to 2002 and from 2005 to 2006 , also serving as a party vice president from 2006 to 2008 .\nDefence Minister .\nHe was named Defence Minister at the end of 2004 , among the cited reasons being his work at the Cugir plant ( which specialised in military equipment ) and his co-authorship in 2000 of a strategy for restructuring Romanias defence industry . Among his initiatives as minister were a reorganisation of the ministry , including a fight against corruption there and an elimination of redundancies ; rest homes for combatants and houses for soldiers ; and compensatory pay for personnel dismissed as part of an ongoing reduction in size of the Romanian Armed Forces . He also promoted a law ending conscription from 2007 , a change he said would promote stability and discipline . He was in office during severe flooding in 2005 that the Army helped combat . He promoted a close strategic partnership with the United States , including a plan for building American military bases in Romania . However , despite affirming his commitment to Romanias participation in both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan in 2005 , the following year he sought Romanias withdrawal from Iraq , a decision opposed and blocked by President Traian Băsescu . Other controversies came when he implied but later backed away from the possibility of intervening militarily in Transnistrias frozen conflict ; and when he disciplined crew members of the Romanian frigate Regina Maria who went on a hunger strike .\nAtanasius downfall as minister began in July 2006 , when he remarked on television that the military intelligence service was spying on the presidential administration , and specifically on spokeswoman Adriana Săftoiu . This prompted Săftoiu to sue him for abuse of office , In September , by which time the Social Democratic parliamentarian Eugen Bejinariu had also sued , Băsescu suspended the minister , citing the need to avoid any suspicion that the investigation might be compromised . The PNL objected to the decision , with Tăriceanu calling the step legal but not obligatory , and party spokesman Varujan Vosganian viewing it as retaliation for his Iraq stance . Shortly thereafter , prosecutors decided not to pursue charges , but Atanasiu remained suspended and in late October , with Băsescu poised to dismiss him , resigned , despite a vow several days earlier to stay on until a judicial request he had made to be reinstated was resolved .\nSubsequent developments .\nTăriceanu immediately named Atanasiu head of the Authority for State Assets Recovery ( AVAS ) , a position he held until December 2008 . He resigned because he had just been elected to the Chamber of Deputies , where he served until September 2009 on the economics , reform and privatisation committee , and continues to serve on the joint parliamentary committee providing oversight to the activities of the Romanian Intelligence Service .\nAt the 2012 local election , he ran for president of the Alba County Council , coming in second with 40.5% of the vote and losing to the Democratic Liberal Party incumbent , the only one of his party to win such a post at the election . That autumn , he was returned to parliament . In late 2014 , he was a candidate for the PNL presidency , but withdrew from the race shortly before it was decided , casting his support behind the winner , Alina Gorghiu . Atanasiu ran for a Buzău County seat in the Senate at the 2016 election , but lost .",

    "story": "Jackie McNamara\nJackie McNamara ( born 24 October 1973 ) is a Scottish professional football manager and executive , and former player . He is a former Scotland international , who filled a variety of defensive roles in his playing career .\nMcNamara began his playing career with Dunfermline Athletic before joining Celtic in 1995 . During ten years at the club he won the Scottish Premier League title four times and the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup three times each . He then played in England with Wolverhampton Wanderers before returning to Scotland , finishing his career with spells at Aberdeen , Falkirk and Partick Thistle .\nIn international football , McNamara played for Scotland at under-21 and B international levels , and made 33 full international appearances . He was a member of the Scotland squad that played at the 1998 FIFA World Cup .\nMcNamara moved into management with Partick Thistle in April 2011 , before his appointment at Dundee United in January 2013 . He was sacked by Dundee United in September 2015 , and two months later took over as manager of York City . He then worked as chief executive at York City . He is currently working with Dunfermline Athletic as a consultant .\nEarly life .\nMcNamara was born at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow and is the son of Jackie McNamara Sr. , a former professional footballer , and Linda Houston . He played youth football for Cumbernauld Colts and Falkirk-based Gairdoch United .\nClub career .\nDunfermline Athletic .\nMcNamara joined Dunfermline Athletic from Gairdoch United on 17 September 1991 .\nCeltic .\nMcNamara moved to Celtic for a £600,000 fee on 3 October 1995 . He made an impressive start to his Celtic career , being named PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year in 1996 . McNamara won his first trophy with the club in the 1997–98 season when Celtic won the Scottish Premier Division , preventing arch-rivals Rangers from winning ten-in-a-row , which would have seen them eclipse Celtics record of nine-in-a-row . He was recognised for his performances this season by his fellow players when being named the PFA Scotland Players Player of the Year in 1998 . He featured regularly in the Celtic first eleven until the arrival of Martin ONeill in the 2000–01 season saw him become more of a fringe player , although he did score the opening goal in the 2001 Scottish Cup Final , a 3–0 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park . He was suspended for their 3–0 victory over Kilmarnock at Hampden Park in the 2001 Scottish League Cup Final .\nMcNamara re-established himself in the team in 2003–04 and was awarded the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 2004 , beating off competition from his teammates Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton . The following year McNamara was named captain when Paul Lambert was injured . McNamara proved himself a consistent and reliable performer on the field , playing almost every game in the league in the 2004–05 season . To reward his loyalty to the club over a ten-year period , Celtic played a testimonial match against the Republic of Ireland . At the end of the 2004–05 season Martin ONeill left as manager and Celtic brought in Gordon Strachan as his replacement .\nMcNamaras contract was also due to expire at the end of the 2004–05 season . Strachan assured McNamara that he wanted him at the club but Celtic were slow to offer a new contract , waiting until the close season to do so . By that time McNamara had already accepted an offer from Wolverhampton Wanderers as he had assumed Celtic no longer wanted his services . As he went on record saying he still wanted to play for the club , he was told he was still needed by the club by its manager , and he was offered the contract he wanted while still in a position to accept it , the incident has caused much speculation amongst supporters and the media as to who was to blame for his departure from Celtic . The club accused McNamara of being unreasonable and of moving for monetary reasons . They also blamed his agent for not encouraging negotiations and setting unhelpful deadlines .\nMcNamara had gone on record as saying he wanted to end his career with Celtic and seemed to be bemused when no new contract was forthcoming . After he had accepted the Wolves offer , McNamara felt that Celtic showed a lack of respect to him in their comments to the media and he accused them of harming his reputation for their own benefit . It also emerged that in his new contract at Wolves , he was earning the same wages as his previous contract with Celtic .\nWolverhampton Wanderers .\nMcNamara agreed with manager Glenn Hoddle that he would join Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer of 2005 on a free transfer . After a promising start to his Wolves career , the player sustained a cruciate knee ligament injury in the home match with Leicester City in September 2005 . He came back in the penultimate game of the 2005–06 season at home to Brighton & Hove Albion . McNamara was a regular fixture in the 2006–07 Wolves team who finished 5th in the Football League Championship , reaching the play-offs .\nAberdeen .\nMcNamara joined Aberdeen from Wolves on a two-year contract in May 2007 , but he left Pittodrie before the end of the season , with manager Jimmy Calderwood citing travelling and injuries as the reasons for his departure . Three weeks later , it was revealed that McNamara would join Falkirk for the 2008–09 season .\nFalkirk .\nMcNamara signed a two-year contract at Falkirk in May 2008 .\nPartick Thistle .\nMcNamara signed a one-month loan deal with Partick Thistle in February 2010 , making him available to debut the following day against Dundee if selected . The terms of the deal allowed it to be extended beyond its initial period , but McNamara suffered a leg break during a match against Ayr United , prematurely ending his 2009–10 season . McNamara subsequently signed a one-year contract with Thistle for the 2010–11 season , which then continued on a one-year rolling contract basis .\nInternational career .\nUnder-21 .\nMcNamara made his debut for the Scotland national under-21 team in a 2–1 away win over Greece on 13 December 1994 , in a 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier.<ref 1994/95></ref> His first goal came in the reverse fixture , a 3–0 home win on 15 August 1995.<ref 1995/96></ref> McNamara finished his under-21 career with 12 caps and one goal , earned between 1994 and 1996 .\nSenior .\nMcNamara was capped once by the B team , in a 3–0 away defeat to Denmark on 23 April 1996 , before making his debut for the senior team in a 2–0 away win over Latvia in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 5 October 1996 . He was selected for the Scotland squad in the 1998 FIFA World Cup . He did not feature in the opening match , a 2–1 defeat against defending champions Brazil in Paris . His introduction from the bench in Scotlands second match , against Norway in Bordeaux , was seen as pivotal in wiping out a one-goal deficit . The game finished in a 1–1 draw , leaving Scotland with a chance of qualification to the knockout stages . Ultimately the efforts were futile as Morocco were victorious in St Etienne with a 3–0 win in the final match and Norway managed to qualify from the group with a win against Brazil . McNamara earned 33 caps for Scotland between 1996 and 2005 .\nManagement career .\nPartick Thistle .\nMcNamara began his managerial career at Partick Thistle where he was appointed caretaker manager on 15 April 2011 , after Ian McCall left his job . He was then appointed manager on a one-year rolling contract a month later . Thistle performed well in his second season as manager , reaching the Challenge Cup final and lying in second place in the First Division in late January 2013 . At this point he left Thistle to take the vacant position at SPL club Dundee United . McNamara was replaced at Partick Thistle by Alan Archibald , a former Thistle and Dundee United defender .\nDundee United .\nMcNamaras first match in charge of his new club was a fifth round Scottish Cup tie with Third Division Rangers on 2 February 2013 . United won 3–0 , with Johnny Russell putting the home side ahead in the first minute of the match . The following week United defeated Hearts 3–1 in McNamaras first Scottish Premier League match as manager of the side . It was the sides first league win at home since August 2012 . On 24 February 2014 , McNamara extended his contract with Dundee United until 2017 .\nMcNamaras first full season at Tannadice saw United reach the Scottish Cup Final , which his side lost 2–0 to St Johnstone . The following season United lost the League Cup Final to Celtic , 2–0 . The latter few months of that season also saw a sharp dip in Uniteds form following the sale in January 2015 of Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong .\nReports following Dundee Uniteds 2–1 defeat to St Johnstone on 26 September 2015 suggested McNamara had been relieved of his duties , which was confirmed by the club two days later .\nYork City .\nMcNamara was appointed manager of League Two club York City on 4 November 2015 , and his first match in charge came three days later , with a 3–2 away defeat to Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup first round . In April 2016 , Yorks relegation from the Football League was confirmed by a 3–0 defeat against Accrington . In October 2016 , a 6–1 defeat against the divisions bottom club , Guiseley , left York in 20th place in the National League .\nFollowing talks between McNamara and the club , York announced the manager would resign if they failed to gain a positive result in their next match , against Braintree Town . Following a 1–1 draw in that match , McNamara announced he would be stepping down , but had agreed to stay on as manager until a replacement was found . When Gary Mills was reappointed manager on 16 October 2016 , McNamara took on the role of chief executive at the club . He left this position in March 2018 .\nReturn to Dunfermline Athletic .\nIn January 2019 , McNamara returned to Scottish football as a consultant at previous club Dunfermline Athletic .\nPersonal life .\nMcNamara co-wrote a television sitcom pilot with Scottish actor and comedy writer Fran Gilhooley called The Therapy Room , starring Jackies actor brother , Donny . The show is based around a young footballer who is catapulted from amateur football to the English top flight , and is partly based around McNamaras own experiences as a player and manager .\nMcNamara was taken to the intensive care unit of Hull Royal Infirmary in February 2020 , after he collapsed near his home in York . His condition was described at one point as critical but stable , but after a few weeks of care he was able to return home .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\nCeltic\n- Scottish Premier Division : 1997–98\n- Scottish Premier League : 2000–01 , 2001–02 , 2003–04\n- Scottish Cup : 2000–01 , 2003–04 , 2004–05 ; runner-up : 2001–02\n- Scottish League Cup : 1997–98 , 1999–2000 ; runner-up : 2002–03\n- UEFA Cup runner-up : 2002–03\nFalkirk\n- Scottish Cup runner-up : 2008–09\nIndividual\n- PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year : 1996\n- PFA Scotland Players Player of the Year : 1998\n- SFWA Footballer of the Year : 2004\nManager .\nDundee United\n- Scottish Cup runner-up : 2013–14\n- Scottish League Cup runner-up : 2014–15",

    "story": "Julio César de León\nJulio César de León Dailey ( ; born 13 September 1979 ) is a Honduran footballer who currently plays for Olancho F.C . in the Honduran Liga Nacional de Ascenso as a midfielder . He is known for being a free-kick specialist and was an important key for the Honduras national football team .\nClub career .\nEarly career .\nNicknamed Rambo , he made his debut for C.D . Platense in 1996 against Real Maya of Tegucigalpa , scoring his first National Soccer League goal . His last goal in the Honduran National League was playing for Olimpia on 26 May 2001 against Club Broncos of Choluteca . Earning a good reputation in Honduras , de León moved abroad to Mexicos First Division , where he played for Atletico Celaya .\nAfter the season was over , Atletico Celaya did not renew his contract , so he returned to Honduras and became part of C.D . Olimpia of Tegucigalpa . Once he finished his one-year contract with Olimpia , he left for Uruguay where he played shortly for Deportivo Maldonado .\nReggina .\nFrom there , de León moved to Reggina of Serie B in Italy . De León started off very well for his new club . With his goals and assists , Rambo helped his team to regain a place in the Italys Serie A . Once in the first division , de Leóns participation was intermittent , partly due to the acquisition of the Japanese international Shunsuke Nakamura . De León was relegated to the bench , playing on and off as a substitute player .\nThe following seasons in Italy proved to be frustrating for Rambo . He was sent on loan back to Serie B where he played for a number of teams , including Fiorentina , Teramo and Catanzaro . His lack of playing time continued to such degree , that he was sent to the third division or Serie C1 , where he played for Sambenedettese . In 2006 , Rambo was requested by coach Mazzarri to come back to Reggina Calcio . De León was given a new chance , and he took it . For a while de León was considered the teams most valuable player .\nGenoa .\nHowever , on 16 January 2007 , De León was transferred by Reggina Calcio again , this time in a permanent deal to Genoa of Serie B , for €3.2 million , along with Filippo Carobbio ( co-ownership ) , hoping that his services would help the team to regain a spot in the Serie A . The fans of Reggina disapproved of the sale of de León , in a time when the team really needed his talent . But the president of the team , Lillo Foti , justified the sale with economic reasons : The offer was good and it was something that we could not refuse. .\nOn 10 June 2007 , de Leóns new team , Genoa , did regain a spot in Serie A , tying at home with Napoli 0–0 . After this , his last game of the season , and some subsequent celebrations , de León quickly traveled to Houston , Texas where the Honduran national team would play Cuba on 13 June 2007 . He helped Honduras reach the quarter-finals of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup .\nParma .\nHe was awarded the Player of the Season award by Genoa . but eventually sold to Parma of Serie B , for €2.9 million, ; Parma player Andrea Gasbarroni ( €2M ) and Magnus Troest ( 50% rights for €1.5M ) moved to opposite side as part of the deal . His Genoa team-mate Alessandro Lucarelli ( €1.2M ) also joined the Emilia–Romagna side .\nHe scored his first goal for the team on 28 November 2008 after a perfectly executed free kick to the corner . Then , he made his second and third goals against Grosseto on 14 February 2009 in Parmas 4–0 victory . He scored his fourth goal for the club on 17 March 2009 against A.C . Mantova in the 82nd minute to put Parma up 1–0 and eventually win the match . His fifth goal was a long-range free kick effort against Pisa F.C . to make the match 2–0 and almost guarantee promotion for Parma into Serie A of Italy . On 16 May 2009 , Julio César de León celebrated the fifth promotion of his career , this time with Parma FC . He finished the season with a total of six goals and also contributed several assists , which proved vital for their return to Serie A .\nAfter having not played for Parma in the first two games , on 28 August 2009 , he was loaned to Torino in the Serie B along with Manuel Coppola , as part of Nicola Amoruso deal . He missed the promotion playoffs of Toro due to international call-up .\nFrom Shandong Luneng to Messina to Real Sociedad .\nAt the start of 2010–11 Serie A he was sold to Shandong Luneng for just €775 . In the 2011–2012 season he has played for F.C . Motagua . In 2012 , he played for Messina in the Italian Serie D and then moved to newly promoted C.D . Real Sociedad in Honduras .\nInternational career .\nDe León played at the 1999 World Youth Cup and made his senior debut for Honduras in a May 1999 friendly match against Haiti . As of December 2012 , he has earned a total of 83 caps , scoring 14 goals . He has represented his country in 34 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 2003 UNCAF Nations Cup as well as at the 2000 , 2003 and 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cups. ,\nDe León also competed for Honduras at the 1999 Pan American Games and 2000 Summer Olympics . and he also was part of the memorable squad in 2001 that defeated Brazil 2–0 and came third in the Copa América .\nOn 20 August 2008 he scored an excellent goal against Mexico to make the score 1–0 for Honduras in the first half of the match , but this goal wasnt enough to draw Pável Pardos two goals that he scored later in the game . However , shortly after , on October , 2008 , Rambo was excluded from the squad by head coach Reinaldo Rueda due to injury . Julio César de León announced he was returning to Italy shortly after arriving in Miami , Florida to join the National Team for the match against Canada . Upon arrival , he lashed out against the National Team for being malequipped to treat an injury that he had conjured in Italy . The coach had a discussion with him in the hotel and he was sent back on another plane shortly after . After long amounts of speculation , he returned to the squad in February , 2009 where he had not been reported to have any problems since .\nDe León was originally named in the 23-men final 2010 FIFA World Cup squad , but on 15 June , one day before the opening match of Honduras , had to pull out due to injury and was replaced by Jerry Palacios , who he was given the opportunity to play alongside his two brothers .\nHonours .\nClub .\n- C.D .
