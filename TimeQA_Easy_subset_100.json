    "story": "Technical University Leuna-Merseburg\nTechnical University Leuna-Merseburg ( German : Technische Hochschule „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg , abbreviated : THLM ) was an institution of tertiary education in the city of Merseburg in todays Saxony-Anhalt , Germany . It was founded on 1 September 1954 as Technische Hochschule für Chemie Leuna-Merseburg ( THC ) and closed on 31 March 1993 . Hochschule Merseburg was founded on the grounds of THLM in 1992 .\nHistory .\nTechnische Hochschule für Chemie Leuna-Merseburg was founded in a ceremony held in Halle ( Saale ) on 1 September 1954 . The first 207 students were registered on 19 October 1954 in the club house of Leuna chemical works , the mathematician Herbert Dallmann ( 1909–1996 ) was appointed as the first rector on this occasion , and the foundation stone of the Merseburg campus was laid . Despite the name of the new institution , it never had any facilities in Leuna ; the name only referred to the largest chemical plant in the GDR .\nThe institution was founded with the aim of creating a Technische Hochschule ( TH ) that offered an application-oriented education in chemistry-related sciences and technology and supported the chemical industry in Central Germany . It can be regarded as a late consequence of the World Wars in the 20th century , and of the economical and political situation of the GDR that required an accelerated development of the industry . Several other institutions of tertiary education were founded at the same time .\nOriginally intended to be located in Leipzig , the new TH was finally established in the smaller and quieter city of Merseburg , situated between two major chemical plants ( Leunawerke with ca . 30000 employees and Buna Werke Schkopau with ca . 20000 employees ) . It was originally attached to the Ministry of Heavy Industries , in December 1955 it was transferred to the newly founded Ministry of Chemical Industry and finally in February 1958 to the State Secretariat and later Ministry of Higher and Technical Education .\nStudents accommodation was provided in dormitories on the campus or in a short distance thereof . Dormitory places not used by THLM students were used for students of the associated specialist Abitur classes or the Industrieinstitut ( which prepared industry workers without Abitur for studies at university level ) and also for younger staff members .\nA festival week was held every five years following the foundation of the THLM . On occasion of its tenth anniversary it was awarded the new name Technische Hochschule für Chemie „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg by the Council of Ministers of the GDR , from 1975 on the name was shortened to Technische Hochschule „Carl Schorlemmer“ Leuna-Merseburg .\nThe library of THLM was the first in the new states of Germany after German Reunification that joined the data network Deutsches Wissenschaftsnetz founded in May 1990 . In November 1990 THLM became a member of German Rectors Conference . The government of Saxony-Anhalt decided in December 1990 to liquidate the institution . The result of an evaluation by the German Council of Science and Humanities in March 1991 was published in June . According to it , the departments of chemistry , process engineering and materials and processing technology were found to perform efficiently and competitively , and should join Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg ( MLU ) . Integration was completed in 1993 , when the employees of THLM became employees of MLU . Closure of THLM was\nlegally stipulated on 28 February 1992 and juridically completed on 31 March 1993 . Incidentally , the last rector , Alfred Göpfert , who had only assumed the office on 14 December 1992 , was also a mathematician .\nRectors .\n- Herbert Dallmann ( 1909–1996 ) , mathematician , 1954 - 1955\n- Eberhard Leibnitz ( 1910–1986 ) , chemist , 1955 - 1958\n- Heinz Schmellenmeier ( 1909–1994 ) , physicist , 1958 - 1961\n- Elmar Profft ( 1905–1978 ) , chemist , March 1961 - December 1961\n- Rolf Landsberg ( 1920–2003 ) , chemist , 1962 - 1964\n- Hans-Joachim Bittrich ( 1923–2010 ) , chemist , 1964 - 1968\n- Hans-Heinz Emons ( born 1930 ) , chemist , 1968 - 1975\n- Gert Naue ( born 1934 ) , engineer in fluid mechanics , 1975 - 1981\n- Margit T .

It was the predecessor of the later Faculty for Process Engineering and Fundamental Sciences which was formed in September 1958 and was awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in August 1959 .\nThe Faculty for Material Sciences was formed in July 1956 and awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in November 1957 . The first doctorate was awarded to Hans-Jürgen Papenfuß in January 1958 , the first honorary doctorate in November 1958 to H . H . Franck .\nThe Faculty for Engineering Economics was also formed in 1956 and was awarded full promotion and habilitation rights in April 1961 .\nThe faculties were subdivided into institutes . Among them were ( in order of their opening ) :\n- 1954 : Institute of Anorganic Chemistry ; Institute of Mathematics ; Division of Social Sciences ; university library ( initially with 3000 books )\n- 1955 : Institute of Organic Chemistry ; Institute of Analytical Chemistry ( the only one of its kind in the GDR ) ; Institute of Physical Chemistry ; Division of Language Education ; Division of Studentical Sports\n- 1956 : Institute of Technical Physics ; Institute of Political Economy ; Institute of Organisation and Planning of Chemical Plants ; Institute of Normatives and Standardisation ; Institute of Accountancy and Finances ; Industrial Institute\n- 1958 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Polymers\n- 1959 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Mineral Salts ; Institute of Petroleum Chemistry ; Institute of Chemical Metals ; Institute of Marxism–Leninism ; Institute of Material Sciences and Mechanical Technologies\n- 1960 : Institute of Economy of the Chemical Industry ; Institute of Process Engineering\n- 1962 : Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Fundamental and Intermediate Organic Chemical Products\n- 1964 : Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering , Apparatus Technology and Project Designing ; the Institute of Technical Physics was divided into the Institute of Automatisation of Chemical Processes and the Institute of Technical Mechanics and Fluid Mechanics\n- 1967 : Institute of Socialist Economic Management ; the Institute of Petroleum Chemistry and Organic Intermediates was formed from the Institutes of Petroleum Chemistry and of Chemistry and Technology of Fundamental and Intermediate Organic Chemical Products ; the Institute of Anorganic and Technical Chemistry was formed from the Institutes of Chemical Metals and of Chemistry and Technology of Mineral Salts\nThe research department of the pharmaceutical works Fahlberg-List in Magdeburg was attached to THC as Forschungsinstitut Magdeburg in 1955 .\nSpecialist classes for chemistry .\nTHC was the first institution of tertiary education in the GDR to establish specialist Abitur classes in 1964 , with a specialist focus on chemistry . There , students who had passed an entrance exam were accepted after finishing the ten-year secondary school , and received specialist instruction in the sciences , in particular in chemistry , on top of the ordinary extended secondary school curriculum . They were already integrated into the university structures , attended lectures and seminars and practical classes in the laboratory , and were to a large extent educated by university teachers .\nRestructuring .\nThe university reforms of the late 1960s in the GDR caused changes in the organisational structure towards greater centralisation . Institutes were transformed into sub-departments ( Wissenschaftsbereich ) and grouped into sections ( Sektion ) ( comparable to departments ) . The following sections were formed :\n- Chemistry\n- Process Chemistry\n- Process Engineering\n- Polymer Sciences ( Hochpolymere )\n- Socialist Economic Management ( SBW )\n- Cybernetics/Mathematics/Data Processing ( KMD )\nNew sections were formed in 1972 from the latter two :\n- Economics\n- Mathematics and Computing Technology\nIn 1976 , the Sections of Process Chemistry and of Polymer Sciences were dissolved and partly attached to the Section of Chemistry . At the same time two new sections were formed :\n- Physics\n- Materials Sciences\nThere existed also a Section of Marxism–Leninism which had no students of its own , but provided the then obligatory education in Marxism–Leninism for the students of all other sections .\nAfter the German reunification , the faculty structure was reintroduced . In 1991 , the following faculties existed :\n- Faculty of Sciences\n- Department of Chemistry\n- Institute of Analytical and Environmental Chemistry\n- Institute of Anorganic Chemistry\n- Institute of Organic Chemistry\n- Institute of Physical Chemistry\n- Institute of Technical Chemistry\n- Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\n- Department of Physics\n- Institute of Theoretical Physica\n- Institute of Experimental Physics\n- Institute of Applied Physics\n- Faculty of Technological Sciences and Mathematics\n- Department of Mathematics and Infoematics\n- Institute of Analysis\n- Institute of Applied Mathematics\n- Institute of Informatics\n- Computer centre\n- Department of Process Engineering\n- Institute of Technical Fluid Mechanics\n- Institute of Fundamentals of Process Engineering\n- Institute of Thermal Process Engineering\n- Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering\n- Institute of Reaction Technology\n- Institute of System Process Engineering\n- Institute of Thechnical Thermodynamics and Energy Management\n- Institute of Automatisation and Electrical Engineering\n- Institute of Technology of Environmental Protection\n- Institute of Biotechnology\n- Department of Materials and Processing Technology\n- Institute of Plastics and Rubber Technology\n- Institute of Processing Technology and Rheology\n- Institute of Materials Technology\n- Institute of Technical Mechanics\n- Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences\n- Department of Economy\n- Institute of Business Management\n- Institute of Interdisciplinary Technological Research\n- Institute of Foreign Languages\nLiterature .\n- Dietrich Werner , D .

    "story": "Simferopol\nSimferopol ( ) is the second-largest city on the Crimean Peninsula , and the capital of the ( Autonomous ) Republic of Crimea . Simferopol is an important political , economic and transport hub of the peninsula , and serves as the administrative centre of both Simferopol Municipality and the surrounding Simferopol District . Founded on the site of a Crimean Tatar town Aqmescit , the city adopted its current name after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire . The population was\nEtymologies .\nThe name Simferopol ( ; ) comes from the Greek Sympheropoli ( , Symferópoli ) , meaning city of common good . The spelling Symferopil ( ) is also used .\nIn Crimean Tatar , the name of the city is Aqmescit , which means The white mosque ( Aq white , and mescit mosque ) . In fact , aq does not refer to the color of the mosque , but to its location . This is due to the color designation of the cardinal points among the Turkic peoples , where white is the west . Thus , the exact translation of the name of the town is the Western Mosque .\nIn English , the name was often given as Akmechet or Ak-Mechet ( e.g . in Encyclopædia Britannica ) , a transliteration from Russian spelling of Crimean Tatar word Акмечет , Ак-Мечеть , where Mechet ( Мечеть ) is the Russian word for mosque .\nHistory .\nEarly history .\nArchaeological evidence in the Chokurcha cave shows the presence of ancient people living in the territory of modern Simferopol . The Scythian Neapolis , known by its Greek name , is also located in the city , which is the remnants of an ancient capital of the Crimean Scythians who lived on the territory from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD .\nLater , the Crimean Tatars founded the town of Aqmescit . For some time , Aqmescit served as the residence of the Qalğa-Sultan , the second most important position in the Crimean Khanate after the Khan himself .\nRussian Empire .\nThe city was renamed Simferopol in 1784 after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire by Catherine II of Russia . The name Simferopol is in Greek , Συμφερόπολις ( Simferopolis ) , and literally means the city of usefulness . The tradition to give Greek names to places in newly acquired southern territories was carried out by Empress Catherine the Great as part of her Greek Plan . In 1802 , Simferopol became the administrative centre of the Taurida Governorate . During the Crimean War of 1854–1856 , the Russian Imperial Army reserves and a hospital were stationed in the city . After the war , more than 30,000 Russian soldiers were buried in the citys vicinity .\n20th-century wars .\nIn the 20th century , Simferopol was once again affected by wars and conflicts in the region . At the end of the Russian Civil War , the headquarters of General Pyotr Wrangel , leader of the anti-Bolshevik White Army , were located there . On 13 November 1920 , the Red Army captured the city and on 18 October 1921 , Simferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic .\nDuring World War II , Simferopol was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1 November 1941 to 13 April 1944 . Retreating NKVD police shot a number of prisoners on 31 October 1941 in the NKVD building and the citys prison . Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol , killing in total over 22,000 locals—mostly Jews , Russians , Krymchaks , and Romani . On one occasion , starting 9 December 1941 , the Einsatzgruppen D under Otto Ohlendorfs command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents ; most of them were Jews .\nIn April 1944 the Red Army liberated Simferopol . On 18 May 1944 the Crimean Tatar population of the city , along with the whole Crimean Tatar nation of Crimea , was forcibly deported to Central Asia in a form of collective punishment .\nWithin Ukraine .\nOn 26 April 1954 Simferopol , together with the rest of the Crimean Oblast , was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev .\nAn asteroid , discovered in 1970 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova , is named after the city ( 2141 Simferopol ) .\nFollowing a referendum on 20 January 1991 , the Crimean Oblast was upgraded an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 12 February 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR .\nSimferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic .\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Simferopol became the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within newly independent Ukraine . Today , the city has a population of 340,600 ( 2006 ) most of whom are ethnic Russians , with the rest being Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities .\nAfter the Crimean Tatars were allowed to return from exile in the 1990s , several new Crimean Tatar suburbs were constructed , as many more Tatars returned to the city compared to number exiled in 1944 . Land ownership between the current residents and returning Crimean Tatars is a major area of conflict today with the Tatars requesting the return of lands seized after their deportation .\nRussian annexation .\nOn 16 March 2014 , a referendum was held whose results showed that a majority of Crimeans voted in favour of independence of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia as a federal subject . The legitimacy of the referendums results has been questioned by several nations and independent news organizations . On 21 March , Simferopol officially became the capital of a new federal subject of the Russian Federation . The referendum was not recognized internationally , and the event was viewed by many as an annexation of the Crimean land by the Russian Federation .\nOn 14 September 2014 , municipal elections were held as part of the Russian Federation , the first elections since the Crimean status referendum of 16 March 2014 .\nGeography and climate .\nLocation .\nSimferopol is located in the south-central portion of the Crimean Peninsula . The city lies on the Salhir River and near the artificial Simferopol Reservoir , which provides the city with clean drinking water . The Simferopol Reservoirs earth dam is the biggest in Europe .\nClimate .\nThe city experiences a humid subtropical or oceanic climate ( depending on which version of the Köppen climate classification is used ) , near the boundary of the humid continental climate . The average temperature in January is and in July . The average rainfall is per year , and there is a total of 2,471 hours of sunshine per year .\nPolitics and administrative divisions .\nAs the capital of the Republic , Simferopol houses its political structure including the Parliament and the Council of Ministers . Simferopol is also the administrative centre of the Simferopolskyi District ( raion ) , however , it is directly subordinate to the Crimean authorities rather than to the district authorities housed in the city itself .\nThe city of Simferopol is administratively divided into three districts ( Zaliznychnyi , Tsentralnyi , and Kyivskyi ) , four urban-type settlements ( Ahrarne , Aeroflotskyi , Hriesivskyi , Komsomolske ) and one village ( Bitumne ) .\nViktor Ageev became city mayor on 11 November 2010 and was then elected chairman of the Simferopol City Council on 29 September 2014 .\nIgor Lukashyov was installed as the head of Simferopol City administration ( i.e . local executive ) after Russia annexed the region in 2014 . He served in this position until his dismissal on 9 November 2018 .\nTransportation .\nSimferopol has a major railway station , which serves millions of tourists each year . In December 2014 Ukraine cut the railway line to Crimea at the border . Currently , the station serves only a commuter ( regional ) passenger train and the Moscow – Simferopol train every day .\nThe city is also connected via the Simferopol International Airport , which was constructed in 1936 . Zavodskoye Airport is situated southwest of Simferopol .\nThe city has several main bus stations , with routes towards many cities , including Sevastopol , Kerch , Yalta , and Yevpatoriya . The Crimean Trolleybus connects Simferopol to the city of Yalta on Crimean Black Sea coast . The line is the longest trolleybus line in the world with a total length of ( since 2014 again ) .\nThe streets of Simferopol have a rare house numbering – the odd numbers are on the right side of the road , looking in the direction in which the numbers increase .\nDemographics .\nAt the last census in 2014 , the population of Simferopol was 332,317 , the highest of any city in the Republic of Crimea and second only to Sevastopol within the Crimean peninsula .\nEconomy .\nWhen it existed , Crimea Air had its head office on the grounds of Simferopol Airport . Simferopol hosts some industries , such as producing Marine automation control systems ; Precise electrical micro machines of low input power ; Power tools , for both professional and household usage .\n- Simferopol Airport , new terminal is to be open with at least 8 gates , the structure of the hall has a wave-like layout .\nIndustry .\n- Fiolent ( two locations )\n- Simferopol chemical industry plants\n- PO Foton\n- Simferopol Airport\n- SEM SElktroMash SELMZ\n- Plastotekhnika and else plastics related\n- Santekhprom SSTP\n- PEK PromElektroKontakt and PromSchitKontakt , ChPO Sfera IzmertelnPribor , SELTZ ElectroTechnical Plant\n- Pnevmatika , other pneumatics tires etc . related industry\n- Monolit SMZKon , TsSI Tavrida SKMKZ , Slava Truda SCMNG , SiMZ Motor Plants\n- Chornomornaftogaz\n- Digital Valley ( Tsifrovaya Dolina ) : silicon industry , computers , wafers and microelectronics , it , other related .

Among them is the largest university in Simferopol and Crimea , the Taurida V.Vernadsky National University , which was founded in 1917 . Crimea State Medical University named after S . I . Georgievsky , also located in Simferopol , is one of the most prominent medical schools of Ukraine . The Crimean Medical University is situated on the plot , where in 1855 a nursery garden was planted by the founder of the Nikita Botanical Gardens Ch.Ch.Steven ( 1781–1863 ) . In 1863–66 a school for girls was built here and in 1931 a medical institute was opened . On the same plot P.Krzhizhanovsky built a three-storey hostel for medical students after the design in 1934 .

    "story": "Customs House , Sydney\nCustoms House , Sydney is a heritage-listed museum space , visitor attraction , commercial building and performance space located in the Circular Quay area at 45 Alfred Street , in the Sydney central business district , in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales , Australia . The building served as a customs house prior to Federation and then as the head office of New South Wales operations of the Government of Australia agency Department of Trade and Customs ( and its successors ) until 1988 . The customs function relocated to a new site in 1990 . The initial designs were by Mortimer Lewis and it was built during 1845 by under the administration of Governor Sir George Gipps . It is also known as Customs House ( former ) and Site of former Customs House . The site was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 ; and to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 .\nOwnership was transferred to the City of Sydney Council in 1994 , when it became a venue for exhibitions and private functions . After being refurbished in 2003 , it has also become the new home of the City of Sydney Library . The ground floor of the building houses a scale model of Sydneys city centre viewed through a glass floor . The model was built by Modelcraft in 1998 and weighs one tonne . Images of the various versions of the building across its history are also displayed on the ground floor .\nHistory .\nPeople of the Eora tribe are said to have witnessed from the site , in 1788 , the landing of the First Fleet . Convict David OConnor was hanged on the site in 1790 and it is said that his ghost haunts the Customs House to this day , offering people rum .\nThe first Customs house in Sydney was built in 1800 . Its location is presumed to be at or near the spot of the landing and official flagraising on the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 . This event marked the foundation of the colony of New South Wales . The site has been occupied by buildings ever since .\nThe driving force behind the construction of the later sandstone edifice on Circular Quay was Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes , the Collector of Customs for New South Wales for a record term of 25 years from 1834 to 1859 . Colonel Gibbes persuaded the Governor of New South Wales , Sir George Gipps , to begin construction of the Customs House in 1844 in response to Sydneys growing volume of maritime trade . The building project also doubled as an unemployment relief measure for stonemasons and laborers during an economic depression which was afflicting the colony at the time .\nThe site at Circular Quay was chosen in 1843 to house the Customs Service for the rapidly growing colony . They were responsible for all imports and exports , excise on locally manufactured goods , immigration control , control of narcotic substances and morally corrupt goods such as books and films . During the war years this included items of enemy origin , or having socialistic or communistic tendencies . Accordingly , areas for storage , administration and public business were included in the original design of the building . As trade increased , so did pressures on space within the Customs House and two new wings were constructed between 1883 and 1889 . These wings provided accommodation for the Shipping Office and Maritime Board . The Customs House opened for business in 1845 and replaced cramped premises at The Rocks . It was partially dismantled and expanded to three levels under the supervision of the then Colonial Architect , James Barnet , in 1887 . Various additions were made over the next century , particularly during the period of World War I , but some significant vestiges of the original Gibbes-Lewis building remain .\nThese demands increased again with the approach of Federation . Customs roles of immigration control and administration of tariffs were major reasons for Federation . They became , at this time , the major revenue raiser for the Commonwealth Government . Extensions were timed to coincide with the change in government . More floors were added to cope with new and expanding duties brought about by the massive political change . More revisions were made between 1915 and 1917 to further accommodate these changes and pressures brought about by the war .\nFew major structural changes have occurred between 1917 and 1995 . This reflects the movement of international shipping away from Circular Quay to other areas of the City and the State .\nFrom 15 June 1990 operations of the Customs Service were relocated to a new site . Ownership was then transferred from the Australian Government to the City of Sydney Council in 1994 . The building underwent several rounds of refurbishment . It was refurbished in 1996-7 to become a venue for exhibitions and private functions . A further round of refurbishment was completed in 1999 , converting the building into the tourism gateway to Sydney ahead of the 2000 Summer Olympics . The building contained galleries , a museum , bars , cafes and a restaurant , as well as performance and exhibition space . The City of Sydneys planning scale model of the City was also moved here from the Town Hall offices . After the Olympics , the building was further refurbished in 2003 to house the main City of Sydney Library , moved here from Town Hall . The site was refurbished and reopened in June 1997 as a combined commercial , performance , tourism and museum space .\nDescription .\nThe two-storey Georgian structure was designed by Mortimer Lewis and featured thirteen large and expensive windows in the facade to afford a clear view of shipping activity in Sydney Cove . Colonel Gibbes , who dwelt opposite Circular Quay on Kirribilli Point , was able to watch progress on the Customs Houses construction from the verandah of his private residence , Wotonga House ( now Admiralty House ) .\nThe building is a composite load-bearing and framed structure . The external masonry walls range from thick , with internal walls approximately . Internal beams vary in fabric from wood to steel . The load-bearing masonry on the perimeter of the building and the steel-framed structure in the core are fairly readily separable in the upper reaches of the building , though the edges of concrete floors do bear on the earlier masonry at the perimeter of the framed structure of the core . The panel walls contained in the 1917 frame are of brick . Floors in the perimeter building are generally suspended timber , joisted with added steel beams , while the framed core has reinforced concrete two-way slabs . Lift shafts exist on the central axis of the building .\nThe roof is a pitched roof on king-post trusses finished with Marseilles tiles of Australian make . Extensive box-gutters run around the perimeter of the 1903 roofs .\nInternal walls are finished with lime plaster , repaired with cement render . Some areas have significant plaster mouldings . Ceiling types are mixed . Window joinery , doors and architraves are generally french polished or varnished . Windows are timber , of french door and vertical sliding sash types , where overlooking the street .\nCondition .\nRecent conservation measures have returned the building to excellent physical condition . The archaeological potential is medium .\nModifications and dates .\n- 1885-1887 : James Barnet architect . Original building partially dismantled and rebuilt to three storeys with side wings , to form a U-shape in plan .\n- 1896-1903 : W.L . Vernon architect . Two phases of alterations resulting in the addition of two new floors and a wing in the rear courtyard , forming an E-shape in plan .\n- 19151-17 : George Oakeshott architect . All building enclosed by the former U-shape was replaced by a framed structure . This opened the ground floor as a large space with a lightwell . A sixth storey comprising caretakers quarters was added .\n- 1925-1990 : various additions by the Commonwealth Department of Works .\n- 1996-7 : Conservation and Refurbishment Project - opened June 1997 .\nHeritage listing .\nOn 22 June 2004 , the building was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List .\nThe Sydney Customs House occupies a unique symbolic and physical position on the site of the First Fleet Landing . Its location is a physical reminder of the importance of Circular Quay as the original maritime centre for the colony . The Customs House contains parts of the oldest surviving building of its type in Australia , used continuously for 145 years . It is a physical record of the history of the Customs Service and its importance in the history of Australia . The Customs House embodies the work of three successive and individually distinguished government architects : Mortimer Lewis , James Barnet and Walter Liberty Vernon .\nBecause of the scarcity of documentary evidence about the early stages of construction , the surviving building fabric from these stages constitutes the principal source of additional evidence about the early history of the building and its occupants .\nCustoms House , Sydney was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria .\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course , or pattern , of cultural or natural history in New South Wales .\nThe Sydney Customs House occupies a unique symbolic and physical position on the site of the First Fleet landing . This historical event has enormous significance to the history of Australia . Its location is a physical reminder of the importance of Circular Quay as the original maritime centre for the colony and is a significant symbol of British imperial sovereignty and colonial commercial expansion . The Customs Service was the only revenue collector in an outpost of Empire struggling for economic survival . It later became a watchdog over ideas , people and goods coming into the country . The internal and external growth and change of the building reflect these changes in use .\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales .\nThe Customs House embodies the work of three successive and individually distinguished official architects of New South Wales . Although Walter Liberty Vernon and James Barnet greatly altered the work of Mortimer Lewis , they did so using similar external materials and proportions so as to generate an overall unity of construction .\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social , cultural or spiritual reasons .\nThe site has significance as the initial point of European invasion of the lands of Aboriginal people .\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .\nBecause of the scarcity of documentary evidence about the early stages of construction , the surviving building fabric from these stages constitutes the principal source of additional evidence about the early history of the building and its occupants .\nThe place possesses uncommon , rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .\nThis site has been ranked as extremely significant in its unique reflection of the commercial expansion of the colony and the nationally significant role of the Customs Service . This is especially true for the early phases of the buildings evolution .",

    "story": "André Bachand ( Progressive Conservative MP )\nAndré Bachand ( born December 8 , 1961 ) is a Canadian politician , who represented the riding of Richmond—Arthabaska as member of the Progressive Conservatives from 1997 to 2003 .\nWhen the PC Party was merged with the Canadian Alliance into the Conservative Party in December 2003 , Bachand left the party and sat as an Independent Progressive Conservative until the 2004 election , and then retired from the House of Commons .\nBorn in Quebec City , Quebec , Bachand has been an administrator , and a business executive . He was the mayor of Asbestos , Quebec , from 1986 to 1997 , and was the Préfet of the MRC dAsbestos from 1987 to 1997 .\nFederal politics .\nYoung Turk .\nBachand was first elected as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1997 , one of five PC MPs elected that year in Quebec . Bachand was one of a handful of new Young Turk PC MPs ( along with Scott Brison , John Herron and Peter MacKay ) who were considered the future youthful leadership material that would restore the ailing Tories to their glory days . In 1998 , Jean Charest stepped down as federal Progressive Conservative leader to make the move to Quebec provincial politics , becoming leader of the federalist Quebec Liberal Party ( unaffiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada ) . Bachand was one of many who unsuccessfully tried to convince Charest to remain in federal politics for at least one more election . Joe Clark succeeded Charest as leader of the PC Party and Bachand was supportive of Clarks candidacy .\nDifficult times .\nThe Quebec-wing of the federal PC Party parliamentary Caucus wrestled with several internal policy issues in the late 1990s after Charests departure including the partys bilingualism policies and the autonomy of provinces in respect to federal powers . Shortly after Joe Clark was elected leader of the federal Tory Party , the federal government brought forward the Clarity Act . The Clarity Act was a Liberal Party of Canada sponsored Bill introduced by then Minister of Intergovernmental affairs Stéphane Dion . The Clarity Act detailed specifically how the province of Quebec could separate and under what conditions a separation could be legal . Clark chose to support Bachand and the Quebec PC Caucus MPs in the party and stated that he was against the Clarity Act while the fifteen other English MPs in the PC parliamentary Caucus voted in favour of the Bill regardless of Clarks stance .\nQuebec lieutenant .\nBy 1999 , Bachand had emerged as the nominal Quebec lieutenant of the Conservatives , attending most PC events in the province with Clark and acting as the partys chief spokesman for Quebec issues . Bachand also was the chief responder to the multiple defections of Quebec Tory party officials , MPs and Senators to the Liberal and Canadian Alliance Parties during this period . In September 2000 , three Quebec PC MPs , fearful of their re-election prospects under Clarks leadership , crossed the floor shortly before the federal election to sit as Liberal MPs , leaving Bachand as the only remaining PC MP in Quebec . He was subsequently re-elected in the 2000 election , as were all three of the MPs who crossed the floor . The Tories emerged from the election retaining party status .\nDeputy leader .\nIn February 2003 , Bachand announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives . However , on May 12 , he announced that he was dropping out of the race and supporting Peter MacKay . Bachand had been running fifth in the race , and had failed to gather support among party delegates and to raise enough money for his campaign . After MacKays victory , Bachand briefly served as Deputy Leader of the Progressive Conservatives until early December 2003 . Before becoming Deputy Leader , Bachand served as the Deputy House Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party , as well as its critic for the Intergovernmental Affairs , Industry , Science Research and Development , and the Deputy Prime Minister portfolios .\nLone independent .\nWhen the party merged with the Canadian Alliance at the end of 2003 , Bachand announced that he would retire from politics . Bachand did not sit with the new Conservative Party of Canada Caucus , and became an independent MP until the June 2004 election . During the June 2004 election , Bachand endorsed the Liberal candidate in the Richmond—Arthabaska race over the Conservative and Bloc Québécois challengers . The riding was ultimately carried by the BQ in their electoral sweep of the province .\nBachands departure from federal politics has been lamented by many Tories hailing from Quebec . In a Macleans article covering the March 2005 founding policy convention of the new Conservative Party , Senator Pierre Claude Nolin mused that if Bachand had remained elected and participatory in the new party , he may served as the new Conservative Partys chief Quebec lieutenant as part of Stephen Harpers attempts to woo Quebec voters .\nReturn to politics .\nIn September 2008 , Bachand announced that he would be the Conservative Party candidate for the district of Sherbrooke in the 40th Canadian General Election . On election night , Bachands comeback attempt was unsuccessful . He lost to Bloc Québécois incumbent Serge Cardin , finishing third with 16.4% of the vote .\nShortly after his election defeat , Bachand was appointed by Harper as Canadas ambassador to UNESCO in Paris . As ambassador , Bachands most high-profile activity was to oppose , on the Canadian governments behalf , the entry of the Palestinian Authority to membership in the organization .\nIn October 2011 , Harper appointed Bachand as his senior advisor on Quebec issues . The post , which previously had been combined with responsibility for being Harpers communications advisor , was reportedly separated from other responsibilities in order to make space for Bachand .\nIn 2013 , Macleans included Bachand as one of the thirteen members of Harpers inner circle , of most-trusted advisors , tasked to try to improve Conservative fortunes in Quebec .\nIn September 2013 , Bachand was hired by the Earnscliffe Strategy Group , an Ottawa public-affairs firm .\nProvincial politics .\nBachand ran for the Coalition Avenir Québec in the riding of Richmond , going on to win in the 2018 provincial election .",

    "story": "Frank de Boer\nFranciscus de Boer ( ; born 15 May 1970 ) is a Dutch football manager who is the current head coach of the Netherlands national team . A former defender , De Boer spent most of his professional playing career with Ajax , winning five Eredivisie titles , two KNVB Cups , three Super Cups , one UEFA Cup , one UEFA Champions League and one Intercontinental Cup . He later spent five years at Barcelona , where he won the 1998–99 La Liga title , before retiring after short spells at Galatasaray , Rangers , Al-Rayyan and Al-Shamal .\nDe Boer is the second most capped outfield player in the history of the Netherlands national team , with 112 caps . He captained Oranje to the semi-finals of both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 . He is the twin brother of Ronald de Boer , with whom he was a teammate at Ajax , Barcelona , Rangers , Al-Rayyan , Al-Shamal and the Netherlands national team .\nAfter retiring from playing , De Boer went into management with the Ajax youth team and as assistant to Bert van Marwijk with the Netherlands national team . In December 2010 , he took over as manager of Ajax and went on to win the Eredivisie title in his first season . In 2013 , he received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title . The following year , he became the first manager to win four consecutive Eredivisie titles . He then had brief spells managing in Serie A with Internazionale in 2016 , Crystal Palace in the Premier League in 2017 , and Atlanta United in MLS in 2019 and 2020 , before becoming the current head coach of the Netherlands national team .\nClub career .\nAjax .\nDe Boer began his career as a left back at Ajax before switching to centre-back , a position he made his own for many years in the national team . He won both the 1991–92 UEFA Cup and 1994–95 UEFA Champions League while at Ajax , in addition to five Eredivisie titles and two KNVB Cups . However , after signing a six-year contract extension with Ajax for the 1998–99 season , he and his twin brother Ronald took successful legal action to have it voided . Ajax had a verbal agreement that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by , he would be released provided the other stayed . Ajax , however , apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the Champions League .\nBarcelona .\nIn January 1999 , Frank and Ronald de Boer signed for Spanish La Liga club Barcelona for £22 million , joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the Camp Nou . After winning the 1998–99 La Liga title , they were unable to repeat their earlier triumphs . In 2000 , Van Gaal was sacked by Barcelona and Frank suffered the ignominy of testing positive for the banned substance nandrolone a year later . He was suspended but he was reinstated after a successful appeal .\nLater career .\nDe Boer briefly moved to Galatasaray in the summer of 2003 before joining his brother at Rangers in January 2004 . He made his Rangers debut in a 1–0 win away at Partick Thistle , but in his second appearance for the club he missed the decisive penalty in the shootout as Rangers lost to Hibernian in the Scottish League Cup semi-final . He made a total of 17 appearances for Rangers , scoring two goals against Aberdeen and Dundee . The De Boer brothers left Rangers after UEFA Euro 2004 to play the rest of their football careers in Qatar with Al-Rayyan . De Boer announced his retirement from football in April 2006 .\nInternational career .\nHaving represented his national team 112 times , he was the most capped player in the history of the Netherlands national team , until Edwin van der Sar surpassed him . De Boer made his debut for the Netherlands in September 1990 against Italy .\nDe Boer also played for the Netherlands in the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups , and the 1992 , 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships . He is well-remembered for the arching 60-yard pass which allowed Dennis Bergkamp to score the last-minute goal that eliminated Argentina in the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup . During Euro 2000 , hosted in his home country and Belgium , De Boer reached another semi-final with the Dutch team . De Boer missed an important penalty kick in the first half of the semi-finals against 10-man Italy and another in the penalty shootout , which led to the Netherlands elimination from the tournament .\nOn 29 March 2003 , in a home match against Czech Republic , De Boer became the first Dutch male footballer to gain 100 caps . He ended his international career after an injury forced him to be replaced in a quarter-final match with Sweden at Euro 2004 . The injury ruled him out from the semi-final match against Portugal , which the Netherlands lost 2–1 .\nStyle of play .\nA talented and well-rounded world-class defender , in addition to his defensive skills , De Boer was also known for his pace , technical ability , accurate passing , and leadership , which enabled him to carry the ball out of defence , play it out from the back , or contribute to his teams offensive play by initiating attacks and creating chances for strikers with long balls . A versatile , intelligent , and elegant left-footed defender , with an ability to read the game and intercept loose balls , he was capable of playing both on the left and in the centre , and was even deployed as a sweeper . He was also a dangerous set-piece taker , renowned for his accurate bending free kicks from anywhere around the penalty area .\nManagerial career .\nIn 2007 , De Boer took up a coaching role at his former club Ajax where he was in charge of the clubs youth sector . During the 2010 World Cup , he was the assistant of the Netherlands national football team to manager Bert van Marwijk , together with retired player Phillip Cocu . The Dutch team reached the final of the tournament , losing to Spain .\nAjax .\nOn 6 December 2010 , after the resignation of Martin Jol , De Boer was appointed caretaker manager of Ajax until the winter break . His first game in charge was a Champions League match against Milan at the San Siro , a match Ajax won 2–0 through goals from Demy de Zeeuw and Toby Alderweireld . De Boer then went on to help Ajax become champions of the Eredivisie for the 2010–11 season in a 3–1 home victory over Twente , the champions of the previous year , on the final matchday , making the first year of his professional coaching career a golden one . I couldnt have wished for a more beautiful birthday present , said De Boer , as the clubs 30th championship was won on his 41st birthday .\nIn two-and-a-half years at the helm of Ajax , De Boer won three championships , making eight in total ( when including the five that he won as a player ) . According to reports , De Boer was offered the chance to interview for the Liverpool job but turned it down to remain with Ajax . I am honoured by the request [ from Liverpool ] but I have only just started with Ajax , he said . In 2013 , De Boer received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title .\nOn 27 April 2014 , De Boer won his fourth successive Eredivisie title with Ajax , the first manager ever to achieve this in the Dutch league . Moreover , it marked the first time Ajax has ever won four successive Eredivisie titles . De Boer has now won a total of nine Eredivisie championships with Ajax as a player and manager , another record ; Johan Cruyff , Sjaak Swart and Jack Reynolds all won eight Eredivisie championships with Ajax . Ajax finished the 2014–15 Eredivisie in second position , a massive 17 points behind champions PSV .\nOn 11 May 2016 , De Boer announced his resignation as manager of Ajax following a disappointing season when Ajax again lost out on the Eredivisie title to PSV on the final matchday of the season .\nInter Milan .\nOn 9 August 2016 , after the departure of Roberto Mancini , De Boer signed a three-year contract with Internazionale for the start of the 2016–17 season . De Boers first match in charge was Inters final pre-season friendly , a 2–0 win against Celtic on 13 August , played on neutral ground at Thomond Park , Republic of Ireland .\nThe club management board also approved expensive signings João Mário and Gabriel Barbosa for the team and De Boer ( they were in fact linked to Mancini and Inter in July ) , and the return to Turkey of recent acquisition Caner Erkin in the last days of transfer window . Gabriel , however , was rarely used in Serie A matches and could not be registered in European competitions due to a penalty imposed on Inter for breaching UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in previous seasons .\nDe Boers first competitive match was a 2–0 away loss to Chievo on 21 August . After the match , De Boer was criticized for using a three-man defence , a style that he had never used while at Ajax . Milan-based newspaper Corriere della Sera went as far as calling Inters performance a disaster . Fortunes soon turned , however , as Inter drew 1–1 against Palermo on 28 August , before winning three games in a row , against Pescara , title-holders Juventus and Empoli . The win against Juventus was highly praised , with De Boer being lauded for substituting Éder for Ivan Perišić , who provided the winning goal . Inters form would not last long , as the club would go on to lose against Roma , Cagliari and Atalanta .\nInter also struggled in the UEFA Europa League under De Boer , as they lost the opening match 0–2 at home against Israeli team Hapoel Beer Sheva on 15 September , and 3–1 against Sparta Prague on 29 September . Inter would then go on to finish last in their group with a total of six points , with three points under De Boer and another three under his successor .\nFollowing a run of four defeats in the last five Serie A matches , which left Inter in 12th place in Serie A , De Boer was sacked on 1 November , having been in charge for only 85 days . His last match was a 1–0 loss to Sampdoria on 30 October . Ironically , during a press interview in the annual general meeting of the shareholders of Internazionale on 28 October , CEO Michael Bolingbroke had confirmed that the club was 100% backing De Boer . ( Bolingbroke himself resigned a few days later . Liu Jun , vice-president of sister company Suning Sports , replaced Bolingbroke. )\nDe Boer argued that he needed more time in order to make a mark as manager at Inter , and thanked his fans on his Twitter profile for the support . He was replaced by former Lazio manager Stefano Pioli on 8 November , the ninth manager Inter have appointed since winning the Treble in 2010 under José Mourinho . Following Piolis initial struggles at Inter , De Boer has hit back at the lack of leadership following Sunings takeover of Inter , which he credits for the lack of trust he was given while there .\nCrystal Palace .\nOn 26 June 2017 , De Boer was announced as the new manager of Premier League side Crystal Palace , replacing the recently resigned Sam Allardyce . He signed a three-year deal with the South London club , but was sacked 10 weeks later when Palace lost their first four league matches of the season without scoring a single goal – the first team in 93 years to have begun a top-flight season in such a fashion . He left having managed the team for only 450 minutes of game time of a Premier League team , making it the shortest reign of the Premier League era ( in terms of number of matches , rather than number of days ) . De Boers only win came in an EFL Cup second-round game , in which Crystal Palace won 2–1 against Ipswich Town . He was replaced by Roy Hodgson .\nWhilst at the club , De Boer attempted to implement a possession-based style of play ; after his sacking , he criticised the clubs players for their resistance to his approach , arguing that the club had signed only two players to fit his philosophy . Palace winger Wilfried Zaha commented on De Boers brief time at the club , stating There wasnt really the right mixture [ of players ] for the way we wanted to play .\nReferencing De Boers stint at Crystal Palace , José Mourinho described De Boer as the worst manager in the history of the Premier League .\nAtlanta United .\nOn 23 December 2018 , De Boer was announced as the head coach of Major League Soccer side Atlanta United , succeeding Gerardo Tata Martino to become the second head coach in the clubs history . In his first season , the team won both the U.S . Open Cup and Campeones Cup , while in MLS action finishing second in the Eastern Conference and reaching the Eastern Conference final .\nOn 24 July 2020 , following Atlantas elimination from the MLS is Back Tournament after losing all three of their matches , Atlanta and De Boer mutually agreed to part ways .\nNetherlands .\nOn 23 September 2020 , the KNVB announced that De Boer would be the new manager of the countrys national football team , signing a contract until the end of 2022 .\nOn 11 November 2020 , after a 1-1 draw with Spain , De Boer became the first ever Netherlands manager to fail to win any of his first 4 fixtures .\nCareer statistics .\nInternational goals .\n( Source )\nHonours .\nPlayer .\nAjax\n- Eredivisie ( 5 ) : 1989–90 , 1993–94 , 1994–95 , 1995–96 , 1997–98\n- KNVB Cup ( 2 ) : 1992–93 , 1997–98\n- Johan Cruijff Shield ( 3 ) : 1993 , 1994 , 1995\n- UEFA Champions League : 1994–95\n- UEFA Cup : 1991–92\n- UEFA Super Cup : 1995\n- Intercontinental Cup : 1995\nBarcelona\n- La Liga : 1998–99\nAl Rayyan\n- Emir of Qatar Cup : 2005\nNetherlands\n- FIFA World Cup fourth place : 1998\nIndividual\n- ESM Team of the Year : 1995–96\n- FIFA World Cup All-Star Team : 1998\n- UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament : 2000\n- Golden Foot : 2016 , as football legend\nManager .\nNetherlands\n- FIFA World Cup Runner-up : 2010 ( assistant manager )\nAjax\n- Eredivisie ( 4 ) : 2010–11 , 2011–12 , 2012–13 , 2013–14\n- Johan Cruyff Shield : 2013\nAtlanta United\n- Campeones Cup : 2019\n- U.S .

    "story": "Fort McMurray\nFort McMurray ( ) is an urban service area in the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo in Alberta , Canada . It is located in northeast Alberta , in the middle of the Athabasca oil sands , surrounded by boreal forest . It has played a significant role in the development of the national petroleum industry . The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire led to the evacuation of its residents and caused widespread damage .\nFormerly a city , Fort McMurray became an urban service area when it amalgamated with Improvement District No . 143 on April 1 , 1995 , to create the Municipality of Wood Buffalo ( renamed the RM of Wood Buffalo on August 14 , 1996 ) . Despite its current official designation of urban service area , many locals , politicians and the media still refer to Fort McMurray as a city . Fort McMurray was known simply as McMurray between 1947 and 1962 .\nHistory .\nBefore the arrival of Europeans in the late 18th century , the Cree were the dominant First Nations people in the Fort McMurray area . The Athabasca oil sands were known to the locals and the surface deposits were used to waterproof their canoes . During the fur trade , the location of Fort McMurray , west of Methye Portage , was an important junction on the fur trade route from eastern Canada to the Athabasca Country . In 1778 , the first European explorer , Peter Pond , came to the region in search of furs , as the European demand for this commodity at the time was strong . Pond explored the region farther south along the Athabasca River and the Clearwater River , but chose to set up a trading post much farther north by the Athabasca River near Lake Athabasca . However , his post closed in 1788 in favour of Fort Chipewyan , now the oldest continuous settlement in Alberta .\nIn 1790 , the explorer Alexander MacKenzie made the first recorded description of the oil sands . By that time , trading between the explorers and the Cree was already occurring at the confluence of the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers . The Hudsons Bay Company and the North West Company were in fierce competition in this region . Fort McMurray was established there as a Hudsons Bay Company post by 1870 , named for the Chief Factor William McMurray . It continued to operate as a transportation stopover in the decades afterwards . The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway arrived in 1915 complementing existing steamboat service .\nThe community has played a significant role in the history of the petroleum industry in Canada . Oil exploration is known to have occurred in the early 20th century , but Fort McMurrays population remained small , no more than a few hundred people . By 1921 , there was serious interest in developing a refining plant to separate the oil from the sands . Alcan Oil Company was the first outfit to begin bulk tests at Fort McMurray . The nearby community of Waterways was established to provide a southern terminus for waterborne transportation when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached there in 1921 .\nAbasands Oil was the first company to successfully extract oil from the oil sands through hot water extraction by the 1930s , but production was very low . Fort McMurrays processing output gradually grew to over 1,100 barrels/day by World War II , and Fort McMurray was set up by the US and Canadian forces as staging ground for the Canol Project .\nFort McMurray and Waterways amalgamated as the village of McMurray ( the Fort was dropped until 1962 , when it was restored to reflect its heritage ) by 1947 , and became a town a year later . Fort McMurray was granted the status of new town so it could get more provincial funding . By 1966 , the towns population was over 2,000 .\nIn 1967 , the Great Canadian Oil Sands ( now Suncor ) plant opened and Fort McMurrays growth soon took off . More oil sands plants were opened , especially after the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis , when serious political tensions and conflicts in the Middle East triggered oil price spikes . The population of the town reached 6,847 by 1971 and climbed to 31,000 by 1981 , a year after its incorporation as a city .\nThe city continued to grow for a few years even after the oil bust caused by the 2003 collapse in world oil prices . The population peaked at almost 37,000 in 1985 , then declined to under 34,000 by 1989 . Low oil prices since the oil price collapse in 1986 slowed the oil sands production greatly , as oil extraction from the oil sands is a very expensive process and lower world prices made this uneconomical . Oil price increases since 2003 made oil extraction profitable again for around a decade , until another slump in oil prices which began in December 2014 and deepened in 2015 resulted in layoffs and postponement of projects .\nOn April 1 , 1995 , the City of Fort McMurray and Improvement District No . 143 were amalgamated to form the Municipality of Wood Buffalo . The new municipality was subsequently renamed the Regional Municipality ( RM ) of Wood Buffalo on August 14 , 1996 . As a result , Fort McMurray was no longer officially designated a city . Instead , it was designated an urban service area within a specialized municipality . The amalgamation resulted in the entire RM of Wood Buffalo being under a single government . Its municipal office is located in Fort McMurray .\nIn June 2013 , heavy rains caused the Hangingstone River to flood , causing a six-day state of emergency , a bridge collapse , the closure of highways 63 and 881 , and the evacuation of 150 people . The flooding was part of more widespread floods in southern Alberta .\nMay 2016 wildfire .\nOn May 3 , 2016 , a large wildfire burning southwest of Fort McMurray resulted in the mandatory evacuation of the community . Record-breaking temperatures , reaching , low relative humidity and strong winds contributed to the fires rapid growth in forests affected by an unusually dry and warm winter .\nUpwards of 88,000 people in the community and surrounding region were evacuated . It was Canadas largest recorded wildfire evacuation in history and third-largest recorded environmental disaster evacuation behind the 1979 Mississauga train derailment and the 1950 Red River flood .\nAbout one-fifth of homes in the community were reported to be destroyed in the fire .\nMay 2017 chlorine gas release .\nIn 2017 chlorine gas was released in Fort McMurray , after chemicals were mixed improperly at a water treatment plant . The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo was fined for the incident in 2020 .\nApril 2020 flood .\nOn April 27 , 2020 , massive ice jams along the Athabasca River resulted in a major flood . It devastated the downtown of Fort McMurray , submerging streets and ruining businesses , cars and houses , and completely wrecking a street , Manning Avenue .\nAround 13,000 people from Fort McMurray and the surrounding area were evacuated .\nGeography .\nFort McMurray is northeast of Edmonton on Highway 63 , about west of the Saskatchewan border , nestled in the boreal forest at the confluence of the Athabasca River , the Clearwater River , the Hangingstone River , and the Horse River . It sits at above sea level . Fort McMurray is the largest community in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo .\nWhite spruce , trembling aspen , balsam poplar and white birch are the most prominent native trees in and around town . Black spruce and tamarack occur in poorly drained areas and jack pine may be seen on the driest sites . European aspen , blue spruce and sand cherry are among the exotic trees occasionally seen .\nClimate .\nWith severe winters except during periods of warming chinook winds , mild to warm summers and only three months which average temperature is higher than , Fort McMurray has a borderline subarctic climate ( Köppen : Dfc ) , very slightly below to be considered a humid continental climate ( Dfb ) as May averages ; and falls into the Natural Resources Canada ( NRC ) Plant Hardiness Zone 3a .\nThe community lies at a lower elevation than most other parts of Alberta , so under the right conditions it can be a hot spot for Alberta , or even all of Canada ( as in April 1980 when its daily mean temperature of was unsurpassed by any other Canadian station ) .\nTemperatures range from an average of in January , to in July . The average annual precipitation is and falls mainly in the summer months . Average annual snowfall is , most of which falls between October and April .\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Fort McMurray was on July 18 , 1941 . The lowest temperature ever recorded was on February 1 , 1917 and December 31 , 1933 .\nNeighbourhoods .\nNeighbourhoods in Fort McMurray include Abasand Heights , Beacon Hill , Eagle Ridge , Grayling Terrace , Gregoire , Lower Townsite , Parsons Creek , Prairie Creek , Saline Creek , Stone Creek , Thickwood Heights , Dickinsfield , Timberlea , Waterways .\nDemographics .\nFederal census .\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada , Fort McMurray recorded a population of 66,573 living in 23,937 of its 28,567 total private dwellings , a change from its 2011 population of 60,555 . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016 .\nIn the 2011 Census , Fort McMurray had a population of 61,374 living in 21,729 of its 26,401 total dwellings , a 28.7% change from its 2006 population of 47,705 . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011 .\nMunicipal census .\nThe permanent population of Fort McMurray according to its 2018 municipal census is 72,056 , a change of from its 2015 municipal census permanent population of 78,382 . In addition , the 2018 municipal census counted a shadow population of 3,559 non-permanent residents for a combined population of 75,615 , while the 2015 municipal census counted 4,342 non-permanent residents for a combined population of 82,724 .\nMigration .\nFort McMurray is a multicultural community , attracting people from all corners of Canada and the world . Generally , moves to Fort McMurray have increased in the last decade . Still , Albertans make up almost half the number of migrants to Fort McMurray , followed by 17% of people originating from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador .\nEconomy .\nFort McMurray is considered the heart of one of Albertas ( and Canadas ) hubs of petroleum production , located near the Athabasca oil sands . Besides the oil sands , the economy also relies on natural gas and pipeline transport , forestry and tourism . Oil sands producers include Syncrude , Suncor Energy , Canadian Natural Resources , and CNOOC Petroleum North America ULC . Fort McMurrays growth is characteristic of a boomtown . Housing prices and rents are far higher in Fort McMurray than most such remote areas , and in 2006 , Fort McMurray had the highest prices in Alberta . The Alberta government has promised to release more Crown land for residential construction , particularly in Timberlea on the north side .\nInfrastructure .\nAir .\nThere are several airports in the area , with Fort McMurray International Airport being the largest in northern Alberta . It is serviced by Air Canada , Air Canada Express , McMurray Aviation , Northwestern Air , WestJet and WestJet Encore , with scheduled flights to Calgary , Edmonton , Fort Chipewyan , Fort Smith , and Toronto . The airport is also serviced by various oil companies with corporate and charter flights heading north to private airstrips at oil sands operations . Flights are frequently booked to capacity because of the high transient worker population and workers who commute to Fort McMurray from other parts of Canada .\nPublic transit .\nFort McMurray Transit operates in the community , with routes that extend to all subdivisions on the south side and subdivisions on the north side . Although the service concentrates on Fort McMurray it does operate to hamlets in the RM including Anzac , Janvier , Conklin and Fort McKay .\nBus .\nEbus and Red Arrow operate scheduled passenger bus services to Edmonton and other communities along Highway 63 , as well as other destinations farther south .\nHighways and roads .\nHighway 63 is the only highway between Fort McMurray and Edmonton . Due to the industrial demands of the oilsands , Highway 63 boasts some of the highest tonnage per kilometre in Canada , and the largest and heaviest loads that trucks have ever carried . Highway 63 was fully twinned in May 2016 . Highway 881 also provides access to the region from Lac La Biche .\nRail .\nCanadian National Railway ( CN ) discontinued the Muskeg Mixed ( mixed train ) to Fort McMurray in 1989 , and there has been no passenger rail service since . CN continues to operate freight service on its line Lac La Biche and points beyond .\nMail .\nCanada Post identified Fort McMurray as having a particularly high cost to serve in January 2014 , and planned to institute a surcharge of $5.00 for all parcels shipped to the area . However , the postal service retracted this decision before the rate change went into effect .\nEducation .\nThe Fort McMurray Public School District ( FMPSD ) and Catholic School District both serve the primary , elementary , and secondary education needs of students in Fort McMurray . Each school district offers diverse programs like French immersion , performing arts or a dedicated technology and science lab , however only FMPSD offers the Advanced Placement program at one of their schools , being Westwood Community High School .\nOn Abasand Drive , École Boréal is the only francophone school in the area and goes from pre-kindergarten to grade 12 .\nKeyano College is a publicly funded college and vocational institute based in the area and plays a role in training workers for the oil sands . Known as the cultural hub of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo , Keyano College contains both a state-of-the-art theatre and recital hall , hosting a variety of musical and theatrical events that attract upwards of 50,000 visitors each season .\nSports and recreation .\nLocal teams include the Fort McMurray Oil Barons of the Alberta Junior Hockey League ( AJHL ) , the Fort McMurray Giants of the Western Canadian Baseball League ( WCBL ) , and the Keyano Huskies of the Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference ( ACAC ) .\nThe MacDonald Island Park recreation centre is located on MacDonald Island north-east of downtown .

In the final qualifying match , Yepes scored both goals in a 2–1 victory against Paraguay .\nDue to his age during the 2014 World Cup qualifiers , Yepes expressed his passion for the national team and wanting to retire either after the World Cup qualifiers or during the 2014 World Cup . José Pékerman promised to meet with his retirement request . On 17 December 2013 , Yepes announced that he would retire after the 2014 World Cup .\nOn 14 June 2014 , Yepes made his first appearance in the FIFA World Cup finals stage at age 38 , captaining Colombia to a 3–0 win over Greece in Belo Horizonte . Yepes was the oldest outfield player at the 2014 World Cup , and the second-oldest overall , after compatriot Faryd Mondragón .\nOn 19 June 2014 , Yepes earned his 100th cap for Colombia in the second group stage match against the Ivory Coast , becoming the third Colombian player to reach the milestone after Valderrama and Leonel Álvarez . He led Colombia to its best ever World Cup performance as they reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their history , where they lost 2–1 to tournament hosts Brazil .\nManagerial career .\nIn late April 2016 Mario Alberto Yepes was named as manager of Deportivo Cali , which became his first managerial experience . Yepes came to replace Fernando Pecoso Castro , who had been dismissed for the poor recent results , especially the early elimination of Copa Libertadores and the farewell of the event at the hands of Boca Juniors with a 6–2 rout . Yepess coaching team had Freddy Hurtado and Julián Barragán as assistants , and Daniel Curbelo as physical trainer . During his period as coach , Deportivo Cali was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the domestic league twice ( at the hands of Independiente Medellín in the Apertura and Atlético Bucaramanga in the Finalización ) , and qualified for the 2017 Copa Sudamericana . However , a streak of poor performances in the start of the 2017 season plus a poor record while playing away from home , led to his exit from the club on 9 March 2017 .\nHonours .\nClub .\nDeportivo Cali\n- Categoría Primera A : 1998\n- Copa Libertadores : Runner-up 1999\nRiver Plate\n- Argentine Primera División : Apertura 1999 , Clausura 2000\nParis Saint-Germain\n- Coupe de France : 2005–06\n- Coupe de la Ligue : 2007–08\n- Trophée des Champions : Runner-up 2006\nA.C .

    "story": "Georgetown Car Barn\nThe Georgetown Car Barn , historically known as the Capital Traction Company Union Station , is a building in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington , D.C. , in the United States . Designed by the architect Waddy Butler Wood , it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the Capital Traction Company as a union terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines . The adjacent Exorcist steps , later named after their appearance in William Friedkins 1973 horror film The Exorcist , were built during the initial construction to connect M Street with Prospect Street .\nIntended for dual use as a passenger station and as a storage house for the streetcars , the Car Barn began Washingtons only cable car system . Almost immediately after the building opened , the system was electrified , and the Car Barn was converted to accommodate electric streetcars . Throughout its history as a terminal and storage facility , the Car Barn was never utilized to the extent anticipated by its construction .\nThe building has undergone several renovations , the most extensive in 1911 , when the original Romanesque Revival façade was significantly modified , and the interior was almost completely gutted . Not long after its opening , the building fell into disrepair . Changing ownership over time , it maintained its original function of housing streetcars until 1950 , when it was redeveloped as office space . Among its occupants was the International Police Academy , an arm of the Central Intelligence Agency , which operated out of the Car Barn in the 1960s and 1970s . Today , it is used as an academic building by Georgetown University . In 2019 , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .\nHistory .\nThe Car Barns original foundation supported a warehouse constructed in 1761 to store tobacco for auction unloaded from ships docked at the location of the present-day Key Bridge . The warehouse was converted to keep horses and their trolleys around 1861 . On August 23 , 1894 , Congress authorized the extension of an existing trolley line terminating at the intersection of Bridge and High Streets ( now Wisconsin Avenue and M Street respectively ) to the intersection of M and 36th Streets . With the authorization , Congress required that a union station be erected at the site . Thereafter , the site was used to store horse-drawn trolley cars .\nConstruction .\nConstruction on the building then known as Union Station began in early 1895 under the architectural direction of Waddy Butler Wood . The superintendent and chief engineer of the Capital Traction Company , D.S . Carll , was in charge of the construction . Before construction of the Car Barn , the two streets were joined by a steep hillside that carried 36th Street . Large amounts of earth were excavated— in total—resulting in the sharp cliff that exists today . Adjacent to the Car Barn are a set of stairs commonly known as the Exorcist steps and a large retaining wall , which were built at the time the Car Barn was constructed , to connect M and Prospect Streets . The steps are so named as they provided the location for the scene in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist where the priest is thrown down the stairs to his death .\nThe buildings construction was opposed by the next-door resident of the Prospect House , who furnished affidavits by prominent architects stating that blasting from the construction was damaging her house ; this led to court-ordered supervision of the blasting in 1894 . After the Car Barns construction , the large edifice obstructed the view of the Potomac River and Virginia from homes on Prospect Street , including the well-known cottage of E . D . E . N . Southworth . For this reason , some considered it a desecration of the local scenery .\nThe three-story , building was opened on May 27 , 1897 , containing offices for the several tenant trolley companies and waiting rooms that were decorated with red oak wainscot panelling , ornate iron stair railings , and stuccoed ceilings . The exterior was designed in the Romanesque Revival style . Its tower , which reached a height of , contained an elevator that shuttled passengers between the terminals . Many of the buildings decorations reflect its original function . The pediment facing M Street reads Capital Traction Company and contains three decorative flywheels .\nThe M Street-facing first floor served the Washington and Georgetown Railroad . The second and third floors were connected with steel trestles to allow for trolleys coming across the Potomac River from Rosslyn , which served Washington , Arlington , Falls Church , and were projected to serve the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad . The roof , which was level with Prospect Street , was used by the Metropolitan Railroad and had a covered walkway for passengers to get from the elevator to Prospect street .\nThe station operated as Washingtons only cable car trolley terminal for less than a year . Almost immediately after opening , the Car Barn was converted to operate the new electric streetcars . The Virginia lines never made use of the terminal , and the Metropolitan Railroad did not use the station to the extent intended . It intended to place storage tracks on the roof of the building but never did .\nRe-design .\nAlthough regarded as well-designed before 1900 , the Car Barn began a period of deterioration and neglect lasting for 50 years . The first stage of the transition from a trolley station to an office building was carried out between 1906 and 1908 when portions of the second floor were converted into office space . The electrification of streetcars necessitated a large-scale re-design of the Barn , which began in 1910 . The entrances to the building were extended to accommodate the larger cars , and a new elevator was installed to lift streetcars to the roof . This transition required a near-complete reconstruction of the building . The steel support beams were replaced , and the entire façade was changed to extend toward M Street and increase its height to allow more office space . These modifications were complete in 1911 .\nFurther conversions of track space to office space occurred between 1921 and 1922 . Extensive remodeling occurred again in 1933 with the designation of the Car Barn as the headquarters of the new Capital Transit Company , as a result of the merger between the Capital Traction Company and the Washington Railway and Electric Company , which increased the number of office workers at the building . These changes involved removing the roof in the center of the building , creating a lightwell on the third floor , converting the third floor into office space , and removing the covered passageway on the roof .\nLater uses .\nThe last streetcar operations at the Car Barn ended with the closure of the Rosslyn–Benning Line on April 30 , 1949 . The building continued to store streetcars until May 1950 . Toward the end of 1952 , the first floor was converted into office space .\nWhen the Capital Transit Company merged with its competitors , the building came under the ownership of its new corporate successor , the DC Transit System , in 1956 . By then , the building had fallen into such a state of disrepair that the company deliberated over whether to demolish it entirely . Seeking to preserve the historic structure , it elected to redevelop it . The building underwent considerable interior renovations between 1957 and 1960 , intended to turn the structure entirely into an office building . This involved lowering the ceilings , which were previously designed to accommodate the height of the streetcars . The building was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1967 .\nBeginning in late 1963 , the Car Barn was home to the International Police Academy , operated by the Central Intelligence Agency ( though officially part of the Agency for International Development ) that trained Latin American police forces ; members of these forces met at the Car Barn until the program was shut down in 1975 .\nIn 1992 , the owner of the DC Transit System , O . Roy Chalk , was subject to foreclosure , and the building came under the ownership of the Lutheran Brotherhood . The Car Barn was purchased in 1997 by Douglas Development Corporation—which continues to own the building—and it was renovated the following year . The primary tenant is Georgetown University , which first began leasing space in the 1950s . After two years of renovation by the university that ended in 2017 , the first floor garage was converted to house the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Georgetown University Press . The building today has four floors and has a floor area of . The Car Barn was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on January 24 , 2019 , and the National Register of Historic Places as part of a multiple property submission named Streetcar and Bus Resources of Washington , DC on August 9 , 2019 .",

    "story": "La Samaritaine\nLa Samaritaine ( French pronunciation : ] ) is a large department store in Paris , France , located in the first arrondissement . The nearest métro station is Pont-Neuf , directly in front at the quai du Louvre and the rue de la Monnaie . The company was owned by Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Jaÿ who hired architect Frantz Jourdain to expand their original store . It started as a small apparel shop and expanded to what became a series of department store buildings with a total of 90 different departments . It has been a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1985 to 1992 .\nIt is currently owned by LVMH , a luxury-goods maker . The store , which had been operating at a loss since the 1970s , was closed in 2005 purportedly because the building did not meet safety codes . Plans for redeveloping the building involved lengthy complications , as the representatives of the stores founders argued with new owners LVMH over the buildings future as a department store or a mixed-use development . The revamped La Samaritaine is due to re-open its doors in February 2021 with retail offerings targeted at affluent consumers , restaurants , and a boutique hotel that includes a penthouse suite with its own private swimming pool . The building has been listed since 1990 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture .\nConstruction history .\nArchitect Frantz Jourdain was originally hired to assist in the remodeling and expansion of the existing store building , known as Magasin 1 . However , as the stores success continued to grow , Cognacq decided to expand into a building across the street , Magasin 2 , which became the site for the Samaritaine as designed by Jourdain . The construction of the building was done in stages , partly because the store had to continue to remain open in order to bring in revenue . Much of the building was brought to the site prefabricated , allowing the construction to occur rapidly . The building was proposed in 1905 and after five years of construction , the building , filling the entire block from rues de la Monnaie , Arbre-Sec , des Petres , and Baillet , was complete in 1910 . The original store , Magasin 1 , was eventually updated with a steel and glass structure to match Magasin 2 , which was located across the street .\nBy the time the department store was completed in 1910 , new movements , such as Fauvism , Cubism , and Werkbund , had come about and devalued the style of the Samaritaine . In the 1920s , Cognacq requested for expansions of the department store . City officials allowed for the expansions with the stipulation that Cognacq follow their specifications which centered around the utilization of a more current architectural style . This was done with little opposition as both Cognacq and Jourdain were aware that the original style of the building was outdated . During this reconstruction and expansion phase , the glass domes and decorative ironwork were removed . The new addition was a collaboration between architects Jourdain and Henry Sauvage , completed between 1926 and 1928 , which featured cream colored stone and was of the Art Deco style . Similar to the original building in that it made use of the exposed steel however , its focus was much more geometry-based . At the end of construction , the Samaritaine eventually consisted of four different Magasins of department stores reaching eleven stories in total .\nLa Samaritaine was bought in 2001 by LVMH , the luxury-goods company that had just previously purchased Le Bon Marché . On 15 June 2005 , in order to update the 19th-century building to modern standards of security , or for purposes of restructuring , as the labor unions believe , the department store was closed . LVMH selected the Japanese architectural firm SANAA to renovate the building . Implementation of the new design has been blocked a number a times by local authorities for failure to adhere to planning requirements and for lack of visual compatibility with the surrounding buildings . In June 2015 , one of the Rivoli building permit is finalized and in September of the same year construction began . This modern construction of the Samaritaine is designed to feature a hotel , restaurant , a brewery , cafes , offices , and housing and is projected to be complete in 2019 .\nDesign .\nJourdains membership in multiple societies heavily influenced his personal architectural theory and design choices for the Samaritaine . Jourdain was the president of the Societe du Nouveau during the height of the Art Nouveau movement . The buildings original design heavily embodies the ideals of this artistic style . While the skeletal structure of the department store is constructed of steel and glass , the building contains many applied adornments which lessen the harshness of its rigid structure . The buildings exterior has two domes made of glass brick that light up in the nighttime . The extended verticals of the domes , sectioned into eight sides , accentuate the height of the building and draw the viewers eye to the top of the store . The facade of the building consists of ceramic panels in brightly colored hues of yellow , white , green , and gold . The word Samaritaine , as well as some of the available merchandise and ware , are displayed around the facade of the building in colorful enamel using an elaborate lettering . Dispersed around these signs are colorful naturalistic flower motifs , which continue to the interior design of the building as well . The interior features decorative iron staircases , glass tile floors , and frescoes using the repeated floral motif . These elements encompass both ornament and functionality which are core principles of the Art Nouveau movement . The foundational ideas of Art Nouveau , and the Samaritaine , led the way to the modern movements of the 1920s .\nThe Department Store as a Type and Consumerism .\nThe main fundamental difference that distinguishes the department store from other stores is its offering of low-priced , mass-produced goods of a wide variety . Prices were able to be placed just slightly above wholesale as the volume of sales was able to compensate for the small margin . Typically , department stores are located centrally within a city and are in close proximity to transportation . Different department stores targeted people of different class distinctions . However , their main audience is the middle-class city dwellers who were highly conscious of their status . The Samaritaine , in particular , targeted the working class who constantly traveled through the first arrondissement for work . The goal of the department store is to move the consumer through the building and to its upper floors in order to maximize the number of counters an individual has to pass . This posed as a bit of a challenge as their target audience was so used to shopping along the street level at various small boutiques . Architects had to entice these shoppers by utilizing grand and decorative elements to allure consumers to explore the building .\nFeatures .\nThe department store is constantly changing to keep up with the architectural trends , yet remains somewhat constant in its appearance as a building type . The design and decor of the building played a major role in enticing the human desire for the consumption of material goods . The common use of iron allowed for minimal skeletal structure and therefore maximized the amount of light that could flow through the interior and allowed more room for the circulation of customers . Many of the structural elements utilized reference to the international exhibition halls built a few years before the original department stores . Another common feature is the monumental stair design , a design element of the first department store , Bon Marche . It was later installed in the Samaritaine as well as other department stores constructed at the turn of the century . The Samaritaine also had the common department store design feature : the light court . The skeletal steel structure allowed for a maximum square footage of glass windows which was intentionally located at the center of the building to bring in ample natural light . The glazed corner rotunda became another crucial element of Parisian department store architecture . It served as a large space for display cases that could be seen by many pedestrians waiting on the street corner . The corner rotunda was also utilized as the entrance of the building , leaving the consumer with two options of vastly-stretching display windows upon entering the building . Finally , the use of a dome structure , and their strategic placement , was useful in identifying the department store as a type . The two domes of the Samaritaine create a sight line between the Seine and the left bank .\nConsumerism .\nThe organization of each individual department within the stores is based on consumption patterns . For example , impulse items , such as jewelry and cosmetics , were placed on the street floor . This would encourage consumers to make quick impulse buys upon entering or right before leaving the store . Also , demand items , such as childrens clothing or household goods , were located on the upper levels . This would force consumers to move past all of the lower level departments before they reached their desired location , maximizing the opportunity for the individual to make an unplanned purchase . Once the Samaritaine consisted of four Magasins , the first was dedicated as a department store solely for womens clothing while the other three were for items such as supplies and tools .\nExternal links .\n- Official homepage",

He was sent on loan to struggling Third Division side Cowdenbeath to gain experience , where he managed to stave off the possibility of finishing bottom of the Scottish league thanks to a win in the final game of the season against fellow strugglers Montrose . When Malcolm finished his spell at St . Johnstone , he moved south of the border to Plymouth Argyle , where he played extensively in the reserves , although he was unable to make inroads in the first team .\nRoss County & Ireland .\nAt the beginning of the 2003–04 season , Malcolm signed for Ross County , and he played the first game of his season for the team in the Scottish League Challenge Cup quarterfinal defeat to Inverness . Malcolm helped Ross County consolidate their position in the league during the 2003–04 season , though towards the end of the year he played much less frequently . This stemmed indirectly from a spate of yellow and red cards . He was first sent off for causing injury to Laurie Ellis , and this was followed by a second for a challenge on Ian Harty . Between February and May , Malcolm played just five games for the side . He was then dropped from the team after Christmas 2004 .\nIn February 2005 , Stuart departed Ross County to join League of Ireland Premier Division side Drogheda United . Stuart became a regular in the team during the 2005 season and made an immediate impression for the County Louth side . Despite a strong first season at Drogheda United , Stuarts one-year contract at the Drogs was not renewed and he became a free agent . It did not take Stuart long to find a new club as he signed for newly promoted Premier Division outfit Dublin City in January 2006 . At his new club , he again became regular in the side and became an integral part of Citys push up the table . Stuarts career at Dublin City was cut short as the club went out of existence in July 2006 due to financial difficulties .\nReturn to Scotland .\nHe then returned to Scottish football by signing for Alloa Athletic , where he made his debut in a 6–1 drubbing at the hands of Cowdenbeath . Later the same month , he picked up his first of three red cards in that term , two of which came in successive appearances . During March 2007 , Malcolm left Alloa and signed for Montrose , but he was released by Montrose at the end of the season .\nReturn to Ireland .\nImmediately after his release from Montrose , Malcolm returned to Irish football by agreeing to sign for Eircom League First Division outfit Shelbourne . The deal was brokered by Malcolms former manager at Dublin City , Dermot Keely , who was then manager of Shels . Keely brought Malcolm to Tolka Park to help add much needed experience and bite to the Shelbourne side who were struggling in their first season in the FAI First Division after the Tolka Park outfits demotion to the second tier of Irish football . Stuart made his Shelbourne debut in a 1–0 victory against Wexford Youths at Tolka Park on 6 July 2007 . He soon scored his first Shelbourne goal during a 5–2 victory over Kilkenny City at Buckley Park . After making 17 appearances for Shels , Malcolm departed in January 2008 to join Finn Harps .\nForfar , Arbroath & Stenhousemuir .\nIn the summer of 2009 , Malcolm signed for Third Division side Forfar Athletic . In the summer of 2010 he signed for Arbroath and was captain of the team during his three seasons with the club . He returned to Forfar in July 2013 , and at the end of the 2014–15 season , left Forfar and signed for Scottish League One rivals Stenhousemuir . After one season with the Warriors , Malcolm returned to Station Park in May 2016 for his third spell with the Scottish League Two side .\nCoaching career .\nMalcolm was appointed assistant manager to Brian Kerr at Scottish League One side Albion Rovers in May 2017 . After the club were relegated to Scottish League Two , Kerr and Malcolm both resigned from their positions after just a year .\nMalcolm joined Brian Kerr at Lowland League team East Kilbride at the start of the 2018-19 season .

    "story": "Julia Richman\nJulia Richman ( 1855–1912 ) was an American educator and pedagogue . She is remembered as the first woman district superintendent of schools in New York City . Richman wrote books on curriculum and started a number of school programs , including an optical one , special education for delinquents , chronic absentee students , as well as those who were above average . She was the first Normal College graduate to serve as principal in New York City and the first Jewish woman to obtain the position . The now defunct Julia Richman High School was named in her honor .\nFamily and education .\nRichman was born on October 12 , 1855 , at 156 Seventh Avenue , New York City , the neighborhood of Chelsea , Manhattan . She was the third child of her parents , Moses and Theresa Melis Richman , with two younger and two older siblings . Her ancestry was a long line of rabbis and teachers , whose graves are in Old Jewish Cemetery , Prague . The cemetery and the graves were visited by Richman on her first European trip .\nAt the time of her birth , her father ( who was in the paint and glazing business ) had the contract to put all the glass in Cooper Institute ( now Cooper Union ) . He accidentally drowned when Richman was just out of her teens . Shortly after she passed her fifth birthday , in the late fall of 1860 , the family moved to Huntington , New York . The three older children were admitted to the Huntington High School . Richman entered the Primary Department , and remained a pupil of the school for six years . She was known as a “tom boy” .\nIn 1866 , the family returned to New York in order to give the older children educational advantages not present in Huntington . They moved to East 13th Street , and Richman entered Grammar School No . 50 , on 20th Street , between Second and Third Avenues . She attended no other public school , remaining there until the opening of the Normal School ( later Normal College , now known as Hunter College ) , in February , 1870 , from which she was graduated in June , 1872 , when she was still 16 . Although she received her diploma at that time , her license to teach was withheld until she had passed her birthday in October . She also attended the School of Pedagogy ( now Steinhardt School of Culture , Education , and Human Development ) in that city .\nEarly career .\nAt seventeen she began to teach in the Grammar Department of one of the largest schools in New York City . A month or two later her father wished her to volunteer as Sabbath School teacher in the temple of which he had been a founder in the year 1848 , and of which he was then a trustee . The congregation had a number of very wealthy members , and their sons were not always well behaved . A class was assigned to her which contained the usual quota of unruly boys . For a few months she taught them . One boy was particularly and constantly troublesome , and she had threatened to report him ; but as this had no effect , she carried out the threat . The reply of the Sabbath School superintendent , no doubt intended to be conciliatory , was : “You must do the best you can , but we cannot be severe with him , as he is the son of one of our richest members.” This attitude of the superintendent to shield the boy because he happened to belong to a wealthy family aroused all her sense of indignation . and she immediately resigned her position . She could not be persuaded to go back , but that day the seed was sown which in after years bore the great fruit of her labors in the Council of Jewish Women , in the Chautauqua and in every direction where she could benefit or improve the Sabbath School system or establish the teaching of ethics . Her interest in this work continued to the end of her life , as is shown by her uncompleted book on Ethics .\nWhen the Council of Jewish Women first organized , she took charge of one of the three circles for the study of the Bible , which were formed in New York . She was a capable leader , but had to give up the work because it conflicted with school duties . Then she became identified with the Jewish Chautauqua , and for a number of years addressed them at their annual meetings in Atlantic City . She also wrote pamphlets useful in their work . She was a tireless worker in the Educational Alliance and in the early days of the Young Women’s Hebrew Association , and in both of these institutions her advice was always sought and usually followed .\nOne of her trips abroad—maybe in 1892—was to England in order to visit the principal schools in London and compare the English educational system in the public schools with the American methods . In London she became acquainted with Claude Montefiore , and a friendship ensued which lasted until her death . Through Montefiore , she met and was entertained by many distinguished English ladies , chief among them being Lady Montefiore , Lady Somerset , Baroness de Rothschild and Lady Magnus , the well—known writer . During this visit , in a conversation upon religious subjects with Montefiore , she suggested to him the advantages that he could give to the public if he would publish the Bible stories as he had told them to his own child . The idea appealed to him , and the “Montefiore Bible for Home Study” was the result .\nDistrict superintendent of schools .\nIn the summer of 1903 , while she was traveling in Europe , a vacancy occurred in the Board of School Superintendents . At the special meeting which was held in order to make a new appointment , it was unanimously decided to offer the position to Richman upon her return . This was done , yet she hesitated about accepting it because she had planned many changes in her own school . Finally , she decided to accept , for she felt she would have a much broader field of action and could accomplish much more . She was the first woman in New York City appointed to that office , and , being the only woman among the five district superintendents , the men gave her the privilege of selecting the district she preferred . Much to their astonishment , for she might have had the best , she chose the lower East Side , and left her uptown home to reside among the people to whose uplift she devoted her life work . She rented a house in the heart of the Ghetto , had it remodeled and modernized in every respect , and made of it a social settlement for the teachers of the district where they could meet every afternoon or evening . She also took some of the teachers into her home as residents .\nShe had 14 day and night schools under her jurisdiction , and in these schools there were nearly 600 teachers whom she had to supervise , and more than 23,000 children . She visited the schools in rotation by day and in the evenings superintended her office work and interviewed parents who came to her office to consult her or to make complaints . One of her notable achievements was the establishing of a special school for delinquent children , which was presided over by the best equipped teachers . Each refractory pupil received special instruction and direction by an able teacher , and many boys who had been deemed fit subjects for a reform school became honest , decent citizens . Later the Board of Education , seeing the success achieved by the delinquent classes , decided to establish special classes for feeble—minded and defective children . This action on the part of the board was due solely to Richman’s persistent appeals to them . Her idea was to separate these unfortunates from the other children so that they should not be subjected to the humiliation of being outstripped by others of their own age , and that each child might get the special training that it required . She was also directly responsible for the examination of children’s eyes in the schools and of furnishing glasses if necessary .\nPhilanthropic and charitable work .\nShe was one of the organizers of and one of the hardest workers in the establishment of “The Consumptives’ Outdoor Home” in New York . This was accomplished under many difficulties , but nothing ever deterred her . She knew so well the ill effects of the crowded tenements , with their lack of air and light , and she watched the rapid strides of the terrible white plague . It was at the same time that the city had begun to abolish the ferryboat system between New York and Long Island . Many old ferryboats were tied up at the docks , and the sight of these gave her the idea . She awakened the interest of influential people and a ferryboat was obtained and placed at her disposal . Then the decks were fitted up with couches , beds , hammocks and awnings , a kitchen and a nurse’s room were furnished , and the floating home for consumptives was established .\nShe was a powerful adviser in the work of the North American Civic League for Immigrants , and many improvements in their mode of dealing with those unhappy people on Ellis Island were due to her suggestions . Her interest and labors in the Juvenile Court never waned , for , to her mind , nothing deserved more encouragement than to aid the children . She established physical culture clubs , literary and debating clubs , for both girls and boys , and any number of “Julia Richman” societies , clubs and athletic leagues flourish on the East Side . She was a factor in the National Educational Association , and was invited to lecture upon educational matters in various cities of the United States . Boston , Chicago , Louisville , Minneapolis , Albany and many smaller towns . She also wrote educational articles for magazines .\n1912 .\nHer last public appearance was in May , 1912 , five weeks before her death , on the occasion of the memorial services held in Carnegie Hall in memory of Mr . and Mrs . Isidor Straus . In the early spring of 1912 , she decided to resign her position on the Board of School Superintendents when the autumn term began , “in order,” as she said , “to give some younger woman a chance.” She had promised to write a book to be published by Macmillan Publishing Company ; it was to be called “Forty Years in the New York Public Schools.” She expected to begin the work during the summer vacation , which she planned to spend in Switzerland . On June 6 , she sailed for Europe , in apparently good health and in excellent spirits . The day before the steamer landed in Cherbourg she was taken ill and was carried from the steamer to the train leaving for Paris . She was rapidly conveyed from the station in Paris to the American Hospital , where an immediate operation for appendicitis was imperative . Her friends , Prof . and Mrs . Richard Gottheil , of New York , who remained with her to the end , told her of her condition and she prepared for the operation without any fear . The operation seemed successful and she rallied wonderfully , but on the fourth day complications arose and five days later , she died at the age of fifty-six . Three weeks later the remains arrived in New York and the last rites took place in the Temple Ahawath Chesed , where she had been a worshipper .\nA memorial service was held on October 12 , her birthday . The program was arranged by a committee composed of members of the Board of Education and of the Jewish Educational Alliance , and the designated place was the public school that she had made famous . The Hon . Egerton Winthrop , Jr. , President of the Board of Education , presided , and in the course of his address promised that the Board of Education would raise a monument to the memory of the departed superintendent which would be imperishable and everlasting . The promise was fulfilled a few months later , when the memorial took the form of a new high school , Julia Richman High School .\nSelected works .\n- The immigrant child , 1905\n- Good citizenship ( with Isabel Richman Wallach ) , 1908\n- What share of blame for the increase in the number of truants and incorrigibles belongs to school ? : [ The problem of the delinquent pupil , II ] , 1909\n- Methods of teaching Jewish ethics ( with Eugene Heitler Lehman ; Jewish Chautauqua Society ) , 1914",

    "story": "Pope Clement II\nPope Clement II ( ; born Suidger von Morsleben ; died 9 October 1047 ) , was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 25 December 1046 until his death in 1047 . He was the first in a series of reform-minded popes from Germany . Suidger was the bishop of Bamberg . In 1046 , he accompanied King Henry III of Germany , when at the request of laity and clergy of Rome , Henry went to Italy and summoned the Council of Sutri , which deposed Benedict IX and Sylvester III , and accepted the resignation of Gregory VI . Henry suggested Suidger as the next pope , and he was then elected , taking the name of Clement II . Clement then proceeded to crown Henry as emperor . Clements brief tenure as pope saw the enactment of more stringent prohibitions against simony .\nEarly career .\nBorn in Hornburg , Lower Saxony , in what is now Germany , he was the son of Count Konrad of Morsleben and Hornburg and his wife Amulrad . In 1040 , he became bishop of Bamberg .\nIn the autumn of 1046 , there were three rival claimants to the papacy , in St . Peters , the Lateran , and St . Mary Majors . Two of them , Benedict IX and Sylvester III , represented rival factions of the nobility . The third , Pope Gregory VI , in order to free the city from the House of Tusculum , and Benedicts scandalous lifestyle , had paid Benedict money in exchange for his resignation . Regardless of the motives , the transaction bore the appearance of simony . Questions regarding the legitimacy of any of them could undermine the validity of a coronation of Henry as Holy Roman Emperor . King Henry crossed the Alps at the head of a large army and accompanied by a brilliant retinue of the secular and ecclesiastical princes of the empire , for the twofold purpose of receiving the imperial crown and of restoring order .\nPapacy .\nIn 1046 , Suidiger accompanied King Henry on his campaign to Italy and in December , participated in the Council of Sutri , which deposed former Benedict IX and Sylvester III and persuaded Gregory VI to resign . Henry nominated Suidger for the papacy and the council elected him . Suidger insisted upon retaining the bishopric of his see , partly for needed financial support , and partly lest the turbulent Romans should before long send him back to Bamberg . Suidger took the name Clement II . Immediately after his election , Henry and the new pope travelled to Rome , where Clement was enthroned . He then crowned Henry III as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire .\nClements election as pope was later criticized by the reform party within the papal curia due to the royal involvement and the fact that the new bishop of Rome was already bishop of another diocese . Contrary to later practice , Clement kept his old see , governing both Rome and Bamberg simultaneously . Clements first pontifical act was to crown Henry and Agnes of Poitou . He bestowed on the Emperor the title and diadem of a Roman patrician , a dignity which was commonly understood to give the bearer the right of indicating the person to be chosen pope .\nClement IIs short pontificate , starting with the Roman synod of 1047 , initiated an improvement in the state of affairs within the Roman Church , particularly by enacting decrees against simony . A dispute for precedence among the Sees of Ravenna , Milan , and Aquileia was settled in favour of Ravenna .\nDeath .\nClement accompanied Henry III in triumphal progress through southern Italy and placed Benevento under an interdict for refusing to open its gates to them . Proceeding with Henry to Germany , he canonized Wiborada , a nun of St . Gall , martyred by the Hungarians in 925 . On his way back to Rome , he died near Pesaro on 9 October 1047 . His corpse was transferred back to Bamberg , which he had loved dearly , and interred in the western choir of the Bamberg Cathedral . His is the only tomb of a pope north of the Alps .\nA toxicologic examination of his remains in the mid-20th century confirmed centuries-old rumors that the pope had been poisoned with lead sugar . It is not clear , however , whether he was murdered or whether the lead sugar was used as medicine .\nBibliography .\n- Dolley , M . ( 1969 ) .

The couple divorced in 1980 because Steve thought Stephen Daniel , known as Danny , was the result of an affair Diane had .\nOn May 8 , 1982 , Downs gave birth to a daughter through surrogacy . She named the child Jennifer before turning her over to her intended parents . Prior to her arrest , Downs was employed by the United States Postal Service , assigned to the mail routes in the city of Cottage Grove , Oregon . Cheryl Lynn , shortly before her death , reportedly told a neighbor of her grandparents that she was afraid of her mother .\nShootings .\nOn May 19 , 1983 , Downs shot her three children and drove them in a blood-spattered car to McKenzie-Willamette Hospital . Upon arrival , Cheryl ( aged 7 ) was already dead , Danny ( aged 3 ) was paralyzed from the waist down , and Christie ( aged 8 ) had suffered a disabling stroke . Downs herself had been shot in the left forearm . She claimed she was carjacked on a rural road near Springfield , Oregon , by a strange man who shot her and the children . However , investigators and hospital workers became suspicious because they decided her manner was too calm for a person who had experienced such a traumatic event . She also made a number of statements that both police and hospital workers considered highly inappropriate .\nSuspicions heightened when Downs , upon arrival at the hospital to visit her children , phoned Robert Knickerbocker , a married man and former coworker in Arizona with whom she had been having an extramarital affair . The forensic evidence did not match her story ; there was no blood spatter on the drivers side of the car , nor was there any gunpowder residue on the drivers door or on the interior door panel . Knickerbocker also reported to police that Downs had stalked him and seemed willing to kill his wife if it meant that she could have him to herself ; he stated that he was relieved that she had left for Oregon and that he was able to reconcile with his wife .\nDowns did not disclose to police that she owned a .22 caliber handgun , but both Steve Downs and Knickerbocker informed them that she did . Investigators later discovered Downs bought the handgun in Arizona . While they were unable to find the actual weapon , they found unfired casings in her home with extractor markings from the murder weapon . Most damaging , witnesses saw her car being driven very slowly toward the hospital at an estimated speed of , contradicting her claim that she drove to the hospital at high speed after the shooting . Based on this and additional evidence , Downs was arrested on February 28 , 1984 , nine months after the shooting , and charged with one count of murder and two counts each of attempted murder and criminal assault .\nProsecution .\nProsecutors argued that Downs shot her children to be free of them so she could continue her affair with Knickerbocker , as she claimed that he let it be known that he did not want children in his life . Much of the case against her rested on the testimony of her surviving daughter , Christie , who , once she recovered her ability to speak , described how her mother shot all three children while parked at the side of the road and then shot herself in the arm .\nDowns was convicted on all charges on June 17 , 1984 , and sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years . She was required to serve 25 years before being considered for parole . Psychiatrists diagnosed her with narcissistic , histrionic , and antisocial personality disorders . Most of her sentence is to be served consecutively . The judge made it clear that he did not intend for Downs to ever be free again .\nAftermath .\nDowns two surviving children eventually went to live with the lead prosecutor on the case , Fred Hugi . He and his wife Joanne adopted them in 1986 .\nPrior to her arrest , Downs became pregnant with a fourth child and gave birth to a girl , whom she named Amy Elizabeth , a month after her 1984 trial . Ten days before Downs sentencing , Amy was seized by the State of Oregon and adopted by Chris and Jackie Babcock , who named her Rebecca . As an adult , Rebecca appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and ABCs 20/20 discussing how she feels about her biological mother . She wrote to Downs in her younger years and has stated that she regrets it , regarding her mother as a monster .\nDowns was incarcerated at the Oregon Womens Correctional Center in Salem .\nShe escaped from her cell in Oregon on July 11 , 1988 by scaling an 18-foot razor wire fence . For ten days Downs managed to escape despite a 14-state manhunt before she was recaptured . She received an additional five-year sentence for the escape . After her recapture , Downs was transferred to the New Jersey Department of Corrections Clinton Correctional Facility for Women after heavy lobbying from Hugi . The Salem prison was located 66 miles from Hugis home in Springfield ; during her ten days of freedom , Hugi had feared that Downs would attempt to travel there in hopes of contacting Christie and Danny . Despite significant security upgrades at the womens facility after the escape , state officials accepted Hugis argument that the risk of harm to Christie and Danny in the event of another escape was too great for Downs to remain incarcerated in Oregon .\nIn 1994 , after serving ten years , Downs was transferred to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . While in prison , she has earned an associate degree in General Studies . In 2010 , she was located in the Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla , California , but transferred out when the facility was converted to an all-male institution in 2013 .\nAuthor Ann Rule wrote the book Small Sacrifices ( 1987 ) detailing Downs life and murder trial . The book documents accounts by friends , acquaintances , neighbors , and her surviving daughter Christie , who question the quality of her parenting . A made-for-TV movie also titled Small Sacrifices , starring Farrah Fawcett as Downs , aired on ABC in 1989 .\nParole hearing .\nDowns sentence meant she could not be considered for parole until 2009 . Under Oregon law at the time , as a dangerous offender , Downs would have been eligible for a parole hearing every two years until she is released or dies in prison .\nIn her first application for parole in 2008 , Downs reaffirmed her innocence . Over the years , she said , I have told you and the rest of the world that a man shot me and my children . I have never changed my story . Her first parole hearing was on December 9 , 2008 . Lane County District Attorney Douglas Harcleroad wrote to the parole board , Downs continues to fail to demonstrate any honest insight into her criminal behavior...even after her convictions , she continues to fabricate new versions of events under which the crimes occurred . He also wrote that she alternately refers to her assailants as a bushy-haired stranger , two men wearing ski masks or drug dealers and corrupt law enforcement officials . Downs participated in the hearing from the Valley State Prison for Women . She was not permitted a statement , but answered questions from the parole board . After three hours of interviews and thirty minutes of deliberation , she was denied parole .\nDowns faced her second parole hearing on December 10 , 2010 , and was denied . Her next parole hearing is scheduled for 2021 .",

    "story": "Alvin E . Roth\nAlvin Elliot Roth ( born December 18 , 1951 ) is an American academic . He is the Craig and Susan McCaw professor of economics at Stanford University and the Gund professor of economics and business administration emeritus at Harvard University . He was President of the American Economics Association in 2017 .\nRoth has made significant contributions to the fields of game theory , market design and experimental economics , and is known for his emphasis on applying economic theory to solutions for real-world problems .\nIn 2012 , he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Lloyd Shapley for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design .\nBiography .\nAlvin Roth graduated from Columbia Universitys School of Engineering and Applied Science in 1971 with a bachelors degree in Operations Research . He then moved to Stanford University , receiving both his Masters and PhD also in Operations Research there in 1973 and 1974 respectively .\nAfter leaving Stanford , Roth went on to teach at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign which he left in 1982 to become the Andrew W . Mellon professor of economics at the University of Pittsburgh . While at Pittsburgh , he also served as a fellow in the Universitys Center for Philosophy of Science and as a professor in the Katz Graduate School of Business . In 1998 , Roth left to join the faculty at Harvard where he remained until deciding to return to Stanford in 2012 . In 2013 he became a full member of the Stanford faculty and took emeritus status at Harvard .\nRoth is an Alfred P . Sloan fellow , a Guggenheim fellow , and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He is also a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) and the Econometric Society . In 2013 , Roth , Shapley , and David Gale won a Golden Goose Award for their work on market design . A collection of Roths papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University .\nWork .\nRoth has worked in the fields of game theory , market design , and experimental economics . In particular , he helped redesign mechanisms for selecting medical residents , New York City high schools and Boston primary schools . Describing the dynamism of market design , Roth suggests that As the conditions of the market change , the behavior of people change and that causes old rules to be discarded and new rules to be created .\nCase study in game theory .\nRoths 1984 paper on the National Resident Matching Program ( NRMP ) highlighted the system designed by John Stalknaker and F . J . Mullen in 1952 . The system was built on theoretical foundations independently introduced by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley in 1962 . Roth proved that the NRMP was both stable and strategy-proof for unmarried residents but deferred to future study the question of how to match married couples efficiently .\nIn 1999 Roth redesigned the matching program to ensure stable matches even with married couples .\nNew York City public school system .\nRoth later helped design the market to match New York City public school students to high schools as incoming freshmen . Previously , the school district had students mail in a list of their five preferred schools in rank order , then mailed a photocopy of that list to each of the five schools . As a result , schools could tell whether or not students had listed them as their first choice . This meant that some students really had a choice of one school , rather than five . It also meant that students had an incentive to hide their true preferences . Roth and his colleagues Atila Abdulkadiroğlu and Parag Pathak proposed David Gale and Lloyd Shapleys incentive-compatible student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm to the school board in 2003 . The school board accepted the measure as the method of selection for New York City public school students .\nBostons public school system .\nWorking with Atila Abdulkadiroğlu , Parag A . Pathak , and Tayfun Sonmez , Roth presented a similar measure to Bostons public school system in 2003 . Here the Boston system gave so much preference to an applicants first choice that were a student to not receive her first or second choice , it was likely that she would not be matched with any school on her list and be administratively assigned to schools which had vacancies .\nSome Boston parents had informally recognized this feature of the system and developed detailed lists in order to avoid having their children administratively assigned . Boston held public hearings on the school selection system and finally in 2005 settled on David Gale and Lloyd Shapleys incentive-compatible student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm .\nNew England Program for Kidney Exchange .\nRoth is a founder of the New England Program for Kidney Exchange along with Tayfun Sonmez and Utku Unver , a registry and matching program that pairs compatible kidney donors and recipients .\nThe program was designed to operate primarily through the use of two pairs of incompatible donors . Each donor was incompatible with her partner but could be compatible with another donor who was likewise incompatible with his partner . Francis Delmonico , a transplant surgeon at Harvard Medical School , describes a typical situation ,\nBecause the National Organ Transplant Act forbids the creation of binding contracts for organ transplant , steps in the procedure had to be performed roughly simultaneously . Two pairs of patients means four operating rooms and four surgical teams acting in concert with each other . Hospitals and professionals in the transplant community felt that the practical burden of three pairwise exchanges would be too large . While the original theoretical work discovered that an efficient frontier would be reached with exchanges between three pairs of otherwise incompatible donors , it was determined that the goals of the program would not be sacrificed by limiting exchanges to pairs of incompatible donors . A 12-party ( six donors and six recipients ) kidney exchange was performed in April 2008 .\nPersonal life .\nRoth is married and has two sons .\nHis elder son , Aaron Roth , is a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania . , his younger son , Ben Roth , is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School .\nBooks .\nRoth is the author of numerous scholarly articles , books , and other publications .

    "story": "Wolfram von Soden\nWolfram Theodor Hermann Freiherr von Soden ( 19 June 1908 in Berlin – 6 October 1996 in Münster ) was the most notable German Assyriologist of the post–World War II era .\nLife and work .\nBorn in Berlin , Wolfram von Soden was a student of the ancient Semitic languages who studied under the Jewish Assyriologist , Benno Landsberger at Leipzig . He received his doctorate in 1931 at age 23 with his thesis Der hymnisch-epische Dialekt des Akkadischen ( The Hymnic-Epic Dialect of Akkadian ) . In 1936 , he was appointed a professor of Assyriology and Arabic studies , a new position at the University of Göttingen . When his mentor , Landsberger , was forced to leave Germany due to National-Socialist racial policy , von Soden joined the Sturmabteilung in 1934 . He was a fervent German nationalist . He joined the NSDAP in 1937\nFrom 1939 to 1945 , von Soden served in the military , primarily as a translator , and in 1940 this work prevented him accepting the offer of a chair in Ancient Near Eastern studies at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin . Von Soden published works that implicitly supported Nazi cultural and racial policy .\nFollowing the Second World War , von Sodens former activities as an involuntary member of the Nazi Party initially barred his reentry to the teaching profession . Because of his extraordinary abilities , however , and thanks to his Doktorvater , Benno Landsberger , who wrote in his support , von Soden was appointed to an academic position at the University of Vienna in 1954 . In 1961 , he accepted the offer of a professorship at Münster , where he served as director of the Oriental Seminar until his retirement in 1976 . At his death in 1996 , he left his scholarly library to the newly revived Institute for Near Eastern Studies at the University of Leipzig , where he had earned his doctorate .\nScholarship .\nAfter World War II , von Soden became a prominent scholar in the world in ancient Semitic languages , and his scholarship greatly influenced his field the post World War II era . He was an integral member of the history of religions ( Religionsgeschichte ) school at Goettingen , and disproved the long-standing claim that the Babylonians had believed in their creator god , Marduk , as a dying , rising god . Instead , he was able to show that the texts that purveyed this view were polemical Assyrian works deriding the chief god of their chief rival state . Von Sodens philological works , particularly the Akkadisches Handwörterbuch ( AHW ) , in which the Dutch scholar Rykle Borger assisted , laid the basis for the detailed philological contributions that later appeared in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary . His Grundriss Akkadischer Grammatik ( GAG ) and the AHW remain the definitive foundational works of Assyriology today and establish von Soden as the dean of ancient Near Eastern Studies in the world .\nHis work has been alleged to promote the Nazi ideology . His early works , especially Der Aufstieg des Assyrreiches als geschichtliches Problem from 1937 , do promote racist concepts of Aryan superiority over the influence of Semitic culture . Another example is Leistung und Grenze sumerischer und babylonischer Wissenschaft ( 1936 ) . In the 1965 edition , page 122 , the conclusion is : “daß Wissenschaft im strengen Sinn des Wortes nur unter den bei den indogermanischen Griechen und Indern gegebenen besonderen Voraussetzungen Gestalt gewinnen konnte” . In the 1936 edition , page 556 , the conclusion is : “daß Wissenschaft im strengen Sinn des Wortes etwas ist , das nur von den durch die nordischen Rasse bestimmten Indogermanen geschaffen werden konnte” .

    "story": "Clara Rackham\nClara Dorothea Tabor Rackham ( 3 December 1875 – 11 March 1966 ) was an English feminist and politician active in the womens suffrage movement , the Womens Co-operative Guild , the peace movement , adult education , the family planning movement , and the labour movement . She was a pioneering magistrate , Poor Law Guardian , educator , anti-poverty campaigner and penal reformer in the city of Cambridge where she was a long-serving city and county councillor . Clara Rackham was vice-chairman of Cambridge County Council from 1956 to 1958 and chairman of the Cambridge County Council Education Committee from 1945 to 1957 . She first came to prominence through her leading role in the National Union of Womens Suffrage Societies and later became a significant national figure in the labour movement , acquiring a formidable national reputation for her expertise on factory conditions , workers rights , equal pay , and national insurance .\nFamily and early life .\nClara Rackham ( known as Dorothea to her family ) was born in Notting Hill , the daughter of Henry Tabor , a gentleman farmer from a non-conformist family based in Bocking in Essex and Emma Tabor ( née Woodcock ) who came from Wigan , Lancashire . She was educated at Notting Hill High School , St Leonards School ( 1892–93 ) , Bedford College in 1894 , and like her older sister , Margaret , attended Newnham College , Cambridge .\nAt Newnham College ( 1895–98 ) Clara studied Classics but much of her time was taken up with outdoor pursuits and with politics . She was a prominent supporter of the Liberal Party in the Newnham College Political Society , a proficient long-distance cyclist , swam regularly in the river Cam , and was captain of the hockey team . Clara left with the equivalent of a third-class degree ( women were not officially allowed to graduate from Cambridge University until 1948 ) . However , she had made a lifelong friend in another Newnham College student , Susan Lawrence , one of the first three women to be elected to parliament as Labour MPs , and had also met her future husband , Harris Rackham , a lecturer in Classics at Newnham college from 1893 . Harris , a brother of the illustrator Arthur Rackham , became a Senior Fellow at Christs College in 1899 . The couple married in 1901 and lived at 4 Grange Terrace before setting up home in a Georgian house at 9 Park Terrace with a pleasant view overlooking Parkers Piece in 1925.The marriage was a happy one and lasted until Harriss death in 1944 . Clara remained in the house until 1957 .\nClara established the Cambridge branch of the Womens Co-operative Guild in 1902 and became its President , remaining active in her local group for over twenty years and writing on the value of co-operative ideals in Cambridge : A Brief Study in Social Questions ( 1906 ) edited by Eglantyne Jebb . Jebb founded the Save the Children Fund in 1919 to raise money for German and Austrian children . In 1923 Clara served on the birth control subcommittee of the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Womens Organizations ( SJCIWO ) and by 1930 had become chairman of the organisation . Clara chaired the National Conference of Labour Women at the Kingsway Hall in London where SJCIWO put forward two reports for discussion ; on abolition of the marriage bar , and on equal pay for equal work . In Cambridge she worked closely with her good friend , the Homerton College-trained Leah Manning ( President of the National Union of Teachers in 1930 , elected as the Labour MP for Islington East in 1928 and then for Epping in 1945 ) . Both women were associated with the ragged school set up in a building in Young Street which is now the site of Anglia Ruskin University Music Therapy Department . In the 1930s Clara supported Mannings initiatives in parliament to welcome Basque children to Britain who were seeking refuge during the Spanish Civil War and some of these children were given homes in Cambridge .\nThe Liberal Party .\nThe youthful Clara was an admirer of William Gladstone . She was the leader of the Liberal group at Newnham College and spoke persuasively in student debates . When Gladstone died in 1898 on the day before she was due to begin part one of the Classical Tripos she was not told the news in case she were to do badly . Clara is first listed as a host of a public meeting in an advertisement that appeared on 24 October 1902 in The Cambridge Independent Press . Her attendance is reported at the public meeting on 29 October 1902 held at the old Sturton Hall . The Liberal Party were protesting against the Education Bill which would have excluded women from their role on school boards . Claras objection to the legislation was that it removed the right of women to be elected by local voters to their existing roles and made them reliant on the consent of other members of boards rather than a direct mandate from the people .\nLeading suffragist .\nLike other suffragists from a privileged background , Clara was brought into direct contact with the plight of the poor and disadvantaged through her work as a Poor Law Guardian and was deeply shocked by what she saw . Her experiences with poor relief for the Castle End ward of Cambridge ( 1904–15 ) reinforced her conviction that it was essential for women to have the vote if things were to change . Adela Adam , a classicist at Girton College and mother of Barbara Wootton ( later Baroness Wootton of Abinger ) , persuaded Clara to join the Cambridge Womens Suffrage Association . This was a branch of the constitutional , non-militant National Union of Womens Suffrage Societies ( NUWSS ) , the President of which was the veteran suffragist , Millicent Garrett Fawcett .\nClara proved to be a first-class organiser , giving rousing speeches , and touring the surrounding villages to drum up support for womens suffrage . She was faced with a very hostile crowd in Newmarket . Clara was elected to the executive committee of the Eastern Federation of the NUWSS and then to the national executive committee which she chaired from 1909 to 1915 when she resigned to take up a position as a government factory inspector . Cambridge sent a sizeable contingent to the Great Pilgrimage of law-abiding suffragists that converged on Hyde Park from routes all over the country in 1913 . Clara joined the procession at Burwell and gave a stirring address to the marchers in the market square in Cambridge before the procession set off for Royston . In London Clara was seated on the podium next to Millicent Fawcett and formed part of the delegation to visit Asquith .\nClara steered the national organisation through its most turbulent period in 1915 with considerable tact and skill when Millicent Fawcetts qualified support for womens involvement in the war effort was opposed by a majority of the NUWSS committee who tendered their resignations and by large sections of the membership who were either pacifists or primarily interested in ending the war by securing a negotiated peace with Germany . Clara managed to combine her deep personal loyalty to Fawcett with her own principled opposition to the war by the advocacy of a compromise whereby the NUWSS would agree to support womens war work in principle but individual members would be permitted to pursue whatever activities they wished either in war work , for example , working in hospitals , or supporting initiatives to bring about peace . Claras proposal was accepted as NUWSS policy thereby averting the very real danger of the organisation falling apart . After women over 30 were enfranchised under the 1918 Represention of the People Act , the NUWSS dissolved itself and was succeeded by the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship in 1919 . Clara had no formal legal training but from 1923 to 1931 she edited , and often wrote , a legal column for The Womens Leader , the journal of the new organisation .\nFactory inspector .\nDuring The First World War Clara worked as a factory inspector for the Home Office and was one of four women appointed to temporary positions on 25 October 1915 working alongside Jeanette Tawney , wife of the philosopher R . H . Tawney . She was deployed initially in Lancashire and then in the London area . The post meant that she had to turn down the offer of an academic position at Bedford College in the University of London , which was founded as a womens college , because she could not be spared from work of national importance . She also worked voluntarily in the University of Liverpool Settlement .\nFrom 1930 to 1932 Clara served on the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance where she clashed with the cotton industry administrator Raymond Streat who thought unemployment benefits ( the dole ) too high , and wrongly assumed this was the consensus on the Commission . Clara was a signatory to a Minority Report by the Labour Party members on the Commission in 1933 . She later published a short book in which she demonstrated her own expertise on factory conditions , Factory Law in 1938 . She was a lifelong advocate of workers rights and an early advocate of the 40-hour work week .\nLabour Party politician in Cambridge .\nAt the end of the First World War Clara joined the Labour Party though she stood as an Independent representing the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship ( NUSEC ) in the Cambridge town council election of March 1919 . Clara developed a close relationship with Hugh Dalton , who was to become Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Attlee ministry of 1945 , and campaigned for Dalton when he contested the 1922 Cambridge by-election . Leah Manning remembered that , during the General Strike of 1926 , the Cambridge strike headquarters was in the Rackhams basement kitchen .\nClara held numerous elected positions in Cambridge and was made an Alderman by both the City and the County Council . She was first elected as a councillor for West Chesterton in north Cambridge ( 1919–22 ) and was later returned for Romsey , a solidly working-class area of the city on the unfashionable side of the railway bridge in which many of the families of local railway workers lived in 1929 . Clara was returned unopposed to represent Romsey for the last time in 1946 .\nClara stood for Parliament twice with no success : she was defeated in ( 1922 ) and lost heavily to a rising star in the Conservative Party , the sitting MP , R . A . Butler , in ( 1935 ) . With the exception of the few years in which she worked as a factory inspector she never left Cambridge . She fought innumerable battles to improve living conditions for the working-class communities in the north and east of the city , lobbying hard for the indoor heated swimming pool on the corner of Parkers Piece and Mill Road . Todays light and airy glass pool remains as one of her lasting achievements . She opened the Rock Road Public Library and also helped to finance the construction of the Labour Club on Mill Road which was built by voluntary labour in the 1920s . Ramsay MacDonald , the first Labour Party Prime Minister , laid the foundation stone in 1926 and Clara spoke at the opening ceremony in 1928 .\nMagistrate and penal reformer .\nClara became a magistrate in 1920 , and , with Florence Ada Keynes ( mother of economist John Maynard Keynes ) and Edith Bethune Baker , was one of the first women in Cambridge to serve on the bench . The work of the criminal justice system and , in particular , the inhumane way in which the law dealt with juvenile offenders became a central concern for her throughout her life . Margery Fry , director of the Howard League for Penal Reform from its inception in 1921 , and another JP , was a good friend . Clara joined the Howard League and worked with Clara Martineau of Birmingham City Council as part of a group reporting on child sexual abuse to Parliament in 1925 . Clara was also a founder-member of the Magistrates Association in 1927 and an advocate of probation , and opponent of corporal punishment . In 1933 she wrote to The Manchester Guardian regarding the recent Children and Young Persons Act and drew attention to the range of options made available to magistrates when dealing with children in need of care or protection while criticising aspects of the legislation for not going far enough . In 1933 she argued that no young person under the age of 17 should be sent to prison . At the time the age limit was 14 . She resigned as a magistrate in 1950 , and from her other committees when she became aware that loss of hearing had made it virtually impossible for her to carry on .\nPioneering Broadcaster .\nClara was a pioneering broadcaster in the early days of BBC radio in the 1920s and one of the first women to be heard on the airwaves . She gave talks on the work of a magistrate and on legal matters . A series How we Manage Our Affairs in 1929 began with a talk How we Elect our Councillors .\nEducation .\nClara was chairman of the Cambridge County Council Education Committee from 1945 to 1957 and took a strong interest in girls education , nursery education , and education in the early years and campaigned for free school milk and meals for the benefit of undernourished children . She was a personal friend of Henry Morris , the innovative Director of Education for Cambridgeshire from 1922,and shared his visionary ideal of the village college . Village colleges combined secondary education with community and adult education and were set up in Sawston , Bottisham , Bassingbourn , Comberton , Impington , Linton and elsewhere in the countryside surrounding Cambridge with Claras enthusiastic support . However , she never fully embraced the Labour Partys post-war support for comprehensive education , believing that small selective grammar schools were of more benefit to working-class children . She served with Lilian Mary Hart Clark on the governing body of the Cambridge School of Arts , Crafts and Technology , which was renamed the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology in 1958 , and Anglia Ruskin University in 2005 . A large modern building containing laboratories and teaching rooms was erected on the Cambridge campus in 1972 and named Rackham in her honour . This was demolished in 2009 . She had a lifelong interest in the education of working people , was a part-time lecturer in social history and local government for the Workers Educational Association , and elected Chairman of the WEA Eastern District . She always valued and retained her links with Newnham College where she organised a summer school for working women and was on the colleges governing body from 1920 to 1940 and on the Newnham College council from 1924 to 1931 .\nThe Peace Movement .\nLike many former suffragists , Rackham placed her hopes for peace in the League of Nations between the wars and she attended meetings of the local Cambridge branch whenever she could . At the height of the Cold War , when the country was beset with fears of a nuclear war breaking out between the Soviet Union and the United States , Clara joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament which was founded in 1958 to call for Britain to lead the world in getting rid of nuclear weapons by disarming unilaterally . Her great-niece , Sarah Rackham , remembers being taken as a child on the annual CND march from Aldermaston to London . Clara participated in her last peace march in 1961 at the age of eighty-five . Other members of the Tabor family , including her niece , Mary Tabor , also remember being taken on the Aldermaston March by Clara when they were children .\nFinal years .\nClara became a well-known figure in Cambridge in her later years , riding everywhere on her bicycle , doing voluntary work in the community , enjoying her contact with young and old alike , adjusting with indomitable good humour to her own loss of hearing , and reading aloud to the partially sighted . In 1962 she delivered her last speech at the Golden Jubilee of the Cambridge Branch of the National Council of Women of Great Britain . In 1993 Joyce Bellamy and Eileen Price , who wrote the entry on Clara Rackham in The Dictionary of Labour Biography , recalled how overwhelmed they had been by the public response to a letter requesting information about Claras life and work which they had sent to The Cambridge Evening News in 1980 . Although she had been brought up in the Christian faith , her outlook on life became decidedly secular over the years and she eventually joined the Humanist Association . Bellamy and Price note that Clara had come to adopt the practice of waiting outside the borough council chamber until the prayers before council meetings had finished . She also refused the Mayoralty of the borough of Cambridge because she did not wish to take part in religious observances while agreeing to chair meetings of Cambridge City Council which were not preceded by prayers ( 1956–1958 ) . She declined the Freedom of the City of Cambridge , requesting instead that a bench be placed outside the Meadowcroft retirement home on Trumpington Road for the use of the residents . She stated that she did not want to have a bust of herself displayed in Shire Hall during her lifetime but stipulated that the council could do whatever they thought was appropriate after her death .\nClara initially moved into the Langdon House residential care home after the death of her sister , Margaret , who had lived with her at 9 Park Terrace after Harris Rackham died . She then relocated herself voluntarily to Meadowcroft to make available a place at Langdon House for an old person who was poorer than she was before returning to Langdon House when another place there became available . Clara died peacefully in Langdon House in 1966 after enjoying her 90th birthday celebrations , which were attended by friends and well-wishers representing over twenty local organisations , charities , and voluntary groups which she had supported over the years . She was cremated at the cemetery in Huntingdon Road on 15 March 1966 . A tribute written in the Newnham College Roll Letter in 1967 reads :\nPublications .\n- Contribution to Cambridge : A Brief Study in Social Questions ( 1906 ) by Eglantyne Jebb , on co-operation\n- Survey of Cambridge for Social Conditions in Provincial Towns ( 1912 ) by Helen Bosanquet\n- Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance , abridged minority report ( 1933 , Fabian Society )\n- Factory Law ( 1938 )\n- Lawless Youth . A Challenge to the New Europe . A Policy for the Juvenile Courts prepared by the International Committee of the Howard League for Penal Reform 1942–1945 ( 1947 ) , with Margery Fry , Max Grünhut , Hermann Mannheim , and Wanda Grabinska .\nLegacy .\nIn 1944 Clara presented the Central Library in Cambridge with a unique collection of , for the most part , signed and numbered editions of Arthur Rackhams illustrated books . Rackham Close , in Arbury , Cambridge , is named after her as was a room in the Alex Wood Hall in Norfolk Street , the headquarters of the Cambridge City Labour Party . A bust was commissioned and manufactured but its whereabouts today are unknown . In 2018 , the centenary of some women obtaining the vote , Clara and Leah Manning were selected by the Womens Local Government Society to be included in their list of pioneers whose lives had inspired a younger generation to engage in service to their local communities .\nA celebration of Clara Rackhams life and work in words , music and theatre organised by Mary Joannou took place in the presence of members of the Rackham family at Anglia Ruskin University on 2 November 2018 . The event included a specially commissioned play entitled Clara Rackham and the General Strike written by local author Ros Connelly , young dancers from the Bodyworks Studio , and presentations by Sarah Rackham , Dr Deborah Thom and Councillor Anna Smith . The official civic ceremony in which the blue plaque was unveiled by Dame Stella Manzie , who spoke about Claras pioneering achievements in local government , took place at Newnham College on 20 November 2018 by kind permission of the Principal , Dame Carol Black and the Fellows . Dr Gillian Sutherland , Fellow Emerita at Newnham College , spoke about Clara in her historical context . Both events were filmed by Antony Carpen and may be seen on YouTube . The blue plaque was put up at 9 Park Terrace , a property belonging to Emmanuel College , on 25 January 2019 and a reception was held in Emmanuel College by kind permission of the Master , Dame Fiona Reynolds , and the Fellows . The blue plaque may be seen on the website of Cambridge , Past , Present and Future , a Cambridge charity which administers the blue plaque scheme . In 2019 The Friends of the Milton Road Library submitted a proposal to name one of the two community rooms in the re-opened Milton Road Library after Clara Rackham . This has yet to receive official approval .",

    "story": "Alexandra Bellow\nAlexandra Bellow ( née Bagdasar ; previously Ionescu Tulcea ; born 30 August 1935 ) is a Romanian-American mathematician , who has made contributions to the fields of ergodic theory , probability and analysis .\nBiography .\nBellow was born in Bucharest , Romania , on August 30 , 1935 , as Alexandra Bagdasar . Her parents were both physicians . Her mother , Florica Bagdasar ( née Ciumetti ) , was a child psychiatrist . Her father , , was a neurosurgeon . She received her M.S . in mathematics from the University of Bucharest in 1957 , where she met and married her first husband , Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea . She accompanied her husband to the United States in 1957 and received her Ph.D . from Yale University in 1959 under the direction of Shizuo Kakutani with thesis Ergodic Theory of Random Series . After receiving her degree , she worked as a research associate at Yale from 1959 until 1961 , and as an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1962 to 1964 . From 1964 until 1967 she was an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign . In 1967 she moved to Northwestern University as a Professor of Mathematics . She was at Northwestern until her retirement in 1996 , when she became Professor Emeritus .\nDuring her marriage to Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea ( 1956–1969 ) , she and her husband wrote a number of papers together , as well as a research monograph on lifting theory .\nAlexandras second husband was the writer Saul Bellow , who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976 , during their marriage ( 1975–1985 ) . Alexandra features in Bellows writings ; she is portrayed lovingly in his memoir To Jerusalem and Back ( 1976 ) , and , his novel The Deans December ( 1982 ) , more critically , satirically in his last novel , Ravelstein ( 2000 ) , which was written many years after their divorce . The decade of the nineties was for Alexandra a period of personal and professional fulfillment , brought about by her marriage in 1989 to the mathematician , Alberto P . Calderón . More details about her personal and professional life can be found in her autobiographical article , and a more recent interview .\nMathematical work .\nSome of her early work involved properties and consequences of lifting . Lifting theory , which had started with the pioneering papers of John von Neumann and later Dorothy Maharam , came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s with the work of the Ionescu Tulceas and provided the definitive treatment for the representation theory of linear operators arising in probability , the process of disintegration of measures . Their Ergebnisse monograph from 1969 became a standard reference in this area .\nBy applying a lifting to a stochastic process , the Ionescu Tulceas obtained a ‘separable’ process ; this gives a rapid proof of Joseph Leo Doobs theorem concerning the existence of a separable modification of a stochastic process ( also a ‘canonical’ way of obtaining the separable modification ) . Furthermore , by applying a lifting to a ‘weakly’ measurable function with values in a weakly compact set of a Banach space , one obtains a strongly measurable function ; this gives a one line proof of Phillipss classical theorem ( also a ‘canonical’ way of obtaining the strongly measurable version ) .\nWe say that a set H of measurable functions satisfies the separation property if any two distinct functions in H belong to distinct equivalence classes . The range of a lifting is always a set of measurable functions with the separation property . The following ‘metrization criterion’ gives some idea why the functions in the range of a lifting are so much better behaved . Let H be a set of measurable functions with the following properties : ( I ) H is compact ( for the topology of pointwise convergence ) ; ( II ) H is convex ; ( III ) H satisfies the separation property . Then H is metrizable . The proof of the existence of a lifting commuting with the left translations of an arbitrary locally compact group , by the Ionescu Tulceas , is highly non-trivial ; it makes use of approximation by Lie groups , and martingale-type arguments tailored to the group structure .\nIn the early 1960s she worked with C . Ionescu Tulcea on martingales taking values in a Banach space . In a certain sense , this work launched the study of vector-valued martingales , with the first proof of the ‘strong’ almost everywhere convergence for martingales taking values in a Banach space with ( what later became known as ) the Radon–Nikodym property ; this , by the way , opened the doors to a new area of analysis , the geometry of Banach spaces . These ideas were later extended by Bellow to the theory of ‘uniform amarts’ , ( in the context of Banach spaces , uniform amarts are the natural generalization of martingales , quasi-martingales and possess remarkable stability properties , such as optional sampling ) , now an important chapter in probability theory .\nIn 1960 Donald Samuel Ornstein constructed an example of a non-singular transformation on the Lebesgue space of the unit interval , which does not admit a formula_1–finite invariant measure equivalent to Lebesgue measure , thus solving a long-standing problem in ergodic theory . A few years later , Rafael V . Chacón gave an example of a positive ( linear ) isometry of formula_2 for which the individual ergodic theorem fails in formula_2 . Her work unifies and extends these two remarkable results . It shows , by methods of Baire category , that the seemingly isolated examples of non-singular transformations first discovered by Ornstein and later by Chacón , were in fact the typical case .\nBeginning in the early 1980s Bellow began a series of papers that brought about a revival of that area of ergodic theory dealing with limit theorems and the delicate question of pointwise a.e . convergence . This was accomplished by exploiting the interplay with probability and harmonic analysis , in the modern context ( the Central limit theorem , transference principles , square functions and other singular integral techniques are now part of the daily arsenal of people working in this area of ergodic theory ) and by attracting a number of talented mathematicians who were very active in this area . One of the two problems that she raised at the Oberwolfach meeting on Measure Theory in 1981 , was the question of the validity , for formula_4 in formula_2 , of the pointwise ergodic theorem along the ‘sequence of squares’ , and along the ‘sequence of primes’ ( A similar question was raised independently , a year later , by Hillel Furstenberg ) . This problem was solved several years later by Jean Bourgain , for formula_4 in formula_7 , formula_8 in the case of the squares , and for formula_9 in the case of the primes ( the argument was pushed through to formula_8 by Máté Wierdl ; the case of formula_2 however has remained open ) . Bourgain was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994 , in part for this work in ergodic theory .\nIt was Ulrich Krengel who first gave , in 1971 , an ingenious construction of an increasing sequence of positive integers along which the pointwise ergodic theorem fails in formula_2 for every ergodic transformation . The existence of such a bad universal sequence came as a surprise . Bellow showed that every lacunary sequence of integers is in fact a bad universal sequence in formula_2 . Thus lacunary sequences are ‘canonical’ examples of bad universal sequences . Later she was able to show that from the point of view of the pointwise ergodic theorem , a sequence of positive integers may be good universal in formula_7 , but bad universal in formula_15 , for all formula_16 . This was rather surprising and answered a question raised by Roger Jones .\nA place in this area of research is occupied by the strong sweeping out property ( that a sequence of linear operators may exhibit ) . This describes the situation when almost everywhere convergence breaks down even in formula_17 and in the worst possible way . Instances of this appear in several of her papers . The strong sweeping out property plays an important role in this area of research . Bellow and her collaborators did an extensive and systematic study of this notion , giving various criteria and numerous examples of the strong sweeping out property . Working with Krengel , she was able to give a negative answer to a long-standing conjecture of Eberhard Hopf . Later , Bellow and Krengel working with Calderón were able to show that in fact the Hopf operators have the strong sweeping out property .\nIn the study of aperiodic flows , sampling at nearly periodic times , as for example , formula_18 , where formula_19 is positive and tends to zero , does not lead to a.e . convergence ; in fact strong sweeping out occurs . This shows the possibility of serious errors when using the ergodic theorem for the study of physical systems . Such results can be of practical value for statisticians and other scientists . In the study of discrete ergodic systems , which can be observed only over certain blocks of time , one has the following dichotomy of behavior of the corresponding averages : either the averages converge a.e . for all functions in formula_2 , or the strong sweeping out property holds . This depends on the geometric properties of the blocks .\nSeveral mathematicians ( including Bourgain ) worked on problems posed by Bellow and answered those questions in their papers .\nAcademic honors , awards , recognition .\n- 1977–80 Member , Visiting Committee , Harvard University Mathematics Department\n- 1980 Fairchild Distinguished Scholar Award , California Institute of Technology , Winter Term\n- 1987 Humboldt Prize , Alexander von Humboldt Foundation , Bonn , Germany\n- 1991 Emmy Noether Lecture , San Francisco\n- 1997 International Conference in Honor of Alexandra Bellow , on the occasion of her retirement , held at Northwestern University , October 23–26 , 1997 .

    "story": "Marțian Dan\nMarțian Dan ( 23 November 1935 – 8 March 2002 ) was a Romanian politician and university professor .\nDan was a member of the Romanian Communist Party during the period of the Socialist Republic of Romania . In 1971 , he became a leader in the Union of Communist Youth , a position that allowed him to serve as Minister in the union from 1971–1972 . In 1974 , he briefly distanced himself from the world of politics due to grievances with the Ceaușescu regime .\nDan was a leader in the Romanian Revolution , and was a member of the Council of the National Salvation Front , in which he served as secretary of the executive office . He joined the National Salvation Front as a political party in 1990 under the leadership of Ion Iliescu .\nEarly political career .\nIn the 1950s , as Dan attended high school in Oradea , he joined the Union of Communist Youth , a youth organization of the Romanian Communist Party ( PCR ) , which had held power in the country since the fall of fascist dictator , Ion Antonescu . From 1954-1955 he was a student of the Faculty of General Economics of the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest , and from 1955-1960 he relocated to the Soviet Union , to take courses at the Faculty of History of the Lomonosov State University of Moscow . In this phase , he succeeded in getting himself elected as a member of the Union of Communist Youth committee of the faculty and secretary of the organizations Romanian students in Moscow .\nAfter graduating in 1960 , Dan began a teaching career at the University of Bucharest in the Department of History and Philosophy , where he taught until 1989 .\nIn the 1960s he continued political militancy within Bucharest , climbing the leadership of the youth organization of the party , which allowed him , in March 1971 , to succeed Ion Iliescu as first secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth and , for that reason , as Minister for Youth Affairs in the Government of Ion Gheorghe Maurer . He left the position in October 1972 .\nIn addition to activism in the Union of Communist Youth , Dan also had connections within the Communist Party of Romania itself . In 1968 , under the regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu , he was appointed as secretary and was responsible for propaganda within the City Committee of Bucharest , while on 12 August 1969 he succeeded in being appointed as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania . In November 1974 he withdrew from political life , apparently because of a difference of views with the then-president of the socialist republic , Nicolae Ceaușescu , concerning management of the country . He concentrated , therefore , almost exclusively on his teaching career .\nDuring the Romanian Revolution .\nWith outbreak of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 , during the power vacuum and the subsequent violence , Marțian Dan , alongside other communist dissidents such as Ion Iliescu , Petre Roman , Dumitru Mazilu , Silviu Brucan , Corneliu Mănescu , Victor Stănculescu and Alexandru Bârlădeanu , promoted the creation of a provisional legislative body , and formed the Council of the National Salvation Front ( CFSN ) which took power in late December 1989 and oversaw the execution of Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife . After the execution , on 27 December Dan was designated by the group led by Iliescu as Secretary of the CFSN Executive Office . The executive group of the council was composed of former major PCR members , that had never denied their adherence to communist ideals , but that had lost faith in Ceaușescu as a leader .\nIn February 1990 Iliescu founded the party of National Salvation Front ( FSN ) , which was formed by an overwhelming majority of CFSN members . At the same time , this was renamed the Interim Council of the National Union ( CPUN ) and it also allowed the participation of other party representatives that had been created after the Revolutions conclusion . The platform , however , followed the organisation of the CFSN , the majority were members of the FSN and its management was confirmed with very few variations . Marțian was secretary of the executive office also in the new entity , which was in charge of holding free elections and enacting the first laws in any democratic sense .\nInfighting , especially between Mazilu and Iliescu , plagued the Nation Salvation Front , and made many of its members wary of the new provisional governments ability to arrive at decisions . Mazilu wanted capitalism , Roman wanted socialism , and Iliescu wanted to keep communism in place , but merely remove Ceaușescu . As a member of the Communist Party , who greatly revered figures such as Ștefan Foriș , whose death had been ordered by Ceaușescus predecessor , Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej , Dan tended toward sympathy for Iliescu , making his loyalties known for when Mazilu was pushed out of the party by Iliescu and other senior party members .\nMember of Parliament .\nIn the first democratic elections in May 1990 , the FSN held a plebiscite that allowed it to control 2/3 of the parliament . Marțian Dan observed the election as deputy in the Vaslui district and , in June 1990 , was appointed president of the Chamber of Deputies , holding office for the entire constituent legislature until October 1992 . He was also a member of the committee drafting the draft Rules of the Chamber and co-chairman of the Constituent Assembly ( July 1990-November 1991 ) .\nBy this time , the FSN had left behind any notion that Communism should be kept in place . Instead , Dan and Iliescu tended toward social democracy , whereas Petre Roman remained loyal to socialism as an ideology .\nIn the spring of 1992 the FSN experienced a split as a result of the clash between the two conflicting tendencies within the party . The FSN itself , led by the president of the republic Ion Iliescu , was a promoter of a line of slow transition to the market economy through social democracy , and former Prime Minister Petre Roman desired to keep the democratic socialism that had remained a strong ideological attraction throughout the revolution . In response to this conflict , Iliescu founded the Democratic National Salvation Front ( FDSN ) , while the counterpart party led by Roman maintained the original initials . Iliescu , with Dan in his cabinet , attended the parliamentary and presidential elections of 1992 under the new party name .\nDan remained loyal to Iliescus new party , which successfully established itself as the largest political party in the national elections of 1992 . The following year , the party changed its name to the Social Democratic Party of Romania ( PDSR ) . Dan , considered one of the leaders of the revolution by much of the Romanian population , became party leader in the House , as well as national vice president of the PDSR serving under Adrian Năstase , a colleague from Dans party .\nFollowing a 1996 defeat to the centre-right Romanian Democratic Convention ( CDR ) , the PDSR moved to the opposition . Dan was reelected for another 4-year term in office , holding varying positions during this time .\nFinal years .\nAt the end of his parliamentary term in June 2001 , Dan became the Romanian ambassador to Portugal , a position he retained until his death on 8 March 2002 .\nOn 12 March 2002 , Dan was adorned with the Order of the Star of Romania by President Ion Iliescu due to his status as one of the leaders who brought democracy to Romania .\nPersonal life .\nDan was married , and he had two children\nAwards and honours .\n: Order of the Star of Romania ( Romania )",

    "story": "Gerald Strickland , 1st Baron Strickland\nGerald Paul Joseph Cajetan Carmel Antony Martin Strickland , 6th Count della Catena , 1st Baron Strickland , ( 24 May 1861 – 22 August 1940 ) was a Maltese and British politician and peer , who served as Prime Minister of Malta , Governor of the Leeward Islands , Governor of Tasmania , Governor of Western Australia and Governor of New South Wales , in addition to sitting successively in the House of Commons and House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom .\nEarly life .\nStrickland was born in Valletta , the son of naval officer Commander Walter Strickland , from the ancient English Strickland family of Sizergh , and Maria Aloysia Bonici-Mompalao , the niece and heiress of Sir Nicholas Sceberras Bologna , fifth Count della Catena in Malta , whom Gerald succeeded in 1875 . He was educated at St Marys College , Oscott , and Trinity College , Cambridge ( BA , LLB ) . Upon graduating , he was admitted to Inner Temple in 1887 entitled to practice as a Barrister-at-Law . He gained the rank of Major in the service of the Royal Malta Militia .\nElected in 1886 to the council of the government of Malta , Strickland began to take an active part in Maltese politics at an early age and in December 1887 , he accompanied Dr . Fortunato Mizzi – founder of the Maltese Nationalist Party – to the first Colonial Conference in London to submit a scheme for a legislative assembly . The result was that the new Maltese Constitution of December 1887 was largely based on the joint Strickland-Mizzi proposals . In the following year , he was appointed as Assistant Secretary to Malta in 1888 and held the office of Chief Secretary of Malta in 1889 , a post which he held till July 1902 when to avert more trouble in Malta which were created by his orders in councils to increase taxation , he was appointed as Governor of the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean .\nSir Gerald and Lady Edeline Strickland left Southampton for Antigua in September 1902 , and took up residence at Government House , St Johns on arrival . He was appointed as Governor of Tasmania in 1904 , serving as such until 1909 , and then as Governor of Western Australia from 1909 to 1913 . In the early years consequent upon Australian Federation he was involved in the delicate matter of State rights and the developing nature of the appointment , role and salaries of governors . Appointed as Governor of New South Wales in March 1913 , on 30 May 1913 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George ( GCMG ) . He was a supporter of the Eugenics Education Society .\nPolitical career .\nIn 1917 , Strickland returned to Malta and , after the grant of Self-Government , formed the Anglo-Maltese Party in 1921 , which soon afterward amalgamated with the Maltese Constitutional Party to become the Constitutional Party under his leadership . Strickland was the leader of the Opposition between 1921 and 1927 . In 1924 , he won the seat of Lancaster for the Conservatives in the United Kingdom House of Commons . He left the House of Commons in 1928 upon being made a peer .\nAfter the 1927 election , Strickland had a majority in the Legislative Assembly and became Head of the Ministry ( the fourth Prime Minister of Malta ) from August 1927 until 1932 . Amongst the most important events of his government were the commencement of building works for St . Lukes Hospital in Gwardamanġia and his clash with the Senate , which led to the issue of Letters Patent which curtailed its powers and his concurrent clash with the ecclesiastical authorities . On 1 May 1930 , Sir Mauro Monsignor Caruana , Titular Archbishop of Rhodes and Bishop of Malta , and Mikiel Monsignor Gonzi , Bishop of Gozo , issued a pastoral letter , read in all the churches of Malta and Gozo . In it , Archbishop Caruana and Bishop Gonzi declared that whoever voted for the Constitutional Party and its former coalition partner , the Labour Party , committed a mortal sin . That year he narrowly avoided assassination .\nThis mortal sin was also committed by those who read Stricklands newspapers , printed by his Progress Press , namely the Daily Malta Chronicle and Ix-Xemx . He subsequently began publishing Il-Progress and Il-Berqa . The clash between the Catholic bishops and the Constitutional Party led to the suspension of the Maltese Constitution following consultations between the British Governor and London . Between July 1932 and November 1933 , Strickland was again the leader of the Opposition , and after the grant of a new Constitution in 1939 , he became the leader of the elected majority in the Council of Government .\nPersonal life .\nStrickland married Lady Edeline Sackville-West ( 1870–1918 ) , the daughter of The 7th Earl De La Warr and the Honourable Constance Mary Elizabeth Cochrane-Wishart-Baillie , on 26 August 1890 . They had six daughters , and two sons who died at an early age . Their first daughter married Henry Hornyold , became known as Mrs Hornyold-Strickland and chaired the Conservative Party Conference in 1947 .\nThey had the following children :\n- Reginald Strickland ( 1892–1893 )\n- Hon . Mary Christina Strickland ( 1896–1970 )\n- Hon . Cecilia Victoria Strickland ( 1897–1982 )\n- Hon . Mabel Edeline Strickland OBE ( 1899–1988 )\n- Margaret Angela Strickland ( 1900–1901 )\n- Hon . Henrietta May Strickland ( 1903–1975 ) , who married Robert Tatton Bower\n- Walter Strickland ( 1901–1902 )\n- Hon . Dr . Constance Teresa Strickland LMSSA ( 1912–1979 )\nOn 31 August 1926 , following the death of Lady Edeline in 1918 , Strickland married Margaret Hulton , daughter of the newspaper proprietor Edward Hulton in the same church as his earlier wedding . She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( DBE ) in the 1937 Coronation Honours . Strickland was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) in 1889 , for rendering invaluable services during a severe cholera epidemic . He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1897 . He was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Strickland , of Sizergh Castle in the County of Westmorland , on 19 January 1928 . He died at Villa Bologna , his residence in Attard , and is buried in the family crypt at St . Pauls Cathedral , Mdina .\nBibliography .\n- Montalto , J. , The Nobles of Malta-1530–1800 , Midsea Books Ltd , Malta , 1980 .\n- Burkes Peerage , Baronetage and Knightage of the UK ( 106th ed. ) ( London 2002 ) .\n- Giles Ash , S. , The Nobility of Malta , Publishers Enterprises Group ( PEG Ltd 1988 ) .\n- Koster , A. , Prelates and politicians in Malta , ( Amsterdam University 1977 ) .",

    "story": "Roy Carroll\nRoy Eric Carroll ( born 30 September 1977 ) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper He is best known for his spells at Wigan Athletic , Manchester United ( where he won a Premier League winners medal and the 2004 FA Cup ) and Olympiacos ( where he won the Greek Superleague and the Greek Cup twice ) . He has also represented Northern Ireland 45 times at full international level , gaining his first cap in 1997 , aged 19 .\nCarroll has also had a one-game managerial career , leading Barnet to a 2–1 victory in the 2011 Herts Senior Cup final against Stevenage . Therefore , Carroll holds the unusual honour of having won a trophy in his only game as a manager .\nEarly career and personal life .\nCarroll was brought up in Tamlaght , County Fermanagh , and began his career with local sides Fivemiletown United and Ballinamallard United .\nIn November 2001 , Carroll received a Red Cross Humanitarian Award for his kindness to a child with leukemia . In November 2006 , he entered rehabilitation for alcohol-related addiction . Stress was cited by the Carroll family .\nClub career .\nHull City .\nCarroll joined Hull City in September 1995 as a trainee and went on to make 50 appearances for the club in all competitions but he was sold two seasons later to pay off Hulls mounting debts .\nWigan Athletic .\nCarroll signed for Wigan Athletic in April 1997 for a then club-record £350,000 . Despite this , he would have to wait seven months to make his first appearance in November 1997 when he replaced Lee Butler in a 2–1 defeat of Watford . He made 170 appearances in all competitions in four years . He played a key role in Wigans unbeaten run of 26 league games in 1999–2000 and was voted the best goalkeeper in the second division by his fellow professionals , a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact he missed the last seven games of the season having had to undergo an emergency appendix operation .\nDespite speculation of a move to a Premier League club , Carroll remained at Wigan for the 2000–01 season , during which he went on to keep 13 clean sheets in 34 first-team games to help his team reach the play-offs for a second consecutive season . In the play-off semi final second leg against Reading the aggregate score was 1-1 as the game entered the final minute . Reading were awarded a penalty which Carroll saved from Jamie Cureton , but Nicky Forster scored from the rebound to send Reading through .\nManchester United .\nHe was signed by defending Premier League champions Manchester United in July 2001 for an undisclosed fee believed to be £2.5 million . He made his debut in a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa on 26 August 2001 . Carroll faced stiff competition against Fabien Barthez at United but won a Premier League winners medal in the 2002–03 season . Carroll received yet more competition for the 2003–04 season , when Manchester United signed American goalkeeper Tim Howard after Barthez left to join Marseille . He won an FA Cup winners medal in May 2004 when he came on as substitute for Howard in the 84th minute . On 19 February 2005 , in an FA Cup match against Everton , Carroll was struck on the back of the head by any of various projectiles including coins and mobile phones , in a match high on security for teammate and Everton returnee Wayne Rooney which Manchester United won 2–0 .\nCarroll gained his greatest infamy for the goal that never was against Tottenham Hotspur in January 2005 ; a speculative shot from the half-way line by Pedro Mendes that Carroll dropped well behind his goal-line then scooped back into play . The referee and his linesmen were unable to verify that the ball had gone over the line and the goal was not given . Though Carroll got away with that particular gaffe , his error led to him being dropped for a few matches . He made a second blunder in a 1–0 defeat by Milan , where he spilled a shot into the path of Hernán Crespo , who then scored . He was released by Manchester United on 27 May 2005 after his contract expired ; he refused to sign a new deal after the club failed to assure him that he would be first choice for the next season .\nWest Ham United .\nThree weeks after leaving Old Trafford , Carroll signed for West Ham . Carroll enjoyed a successful start to his West Ham career , making 19 appearances . However , a back injury sustained in a game against Fulham on 23 January 2006 left him needing surgery , and he was sidelined for the remainder of the 2005–06 season , including the FA Cup Final against Liverpool . Shaka Hislop was his replacement . He made just 17 appearances in the 2006–07 season , due to personal problems relating to alcohol and gambling and the arrival of Robert Green . His final game for the Hammers took place on 3 February 2007 against Aston Villa . On 25 May 2007 , West Ham stated that he had been released after asking for a transfer to achieve regular first team football .\nRangers .\nCarroll signed for Rangers on a one-year contract on 7 July 2007 , initially as cover for Allan McGregor but also to challenge for a starting place . He made his only appearance for Rangers against East Fife in a League Cup match on 26 September 2007 .\nDerby County .\nOn 9 January 2008 , it was revealed that Carroll was in line for a move to Premier League side Derby County . Carroll was allowed permission to talk with Derby and personal terms were agreed , but the deal hinged on Rangers signing a replacement goalkeeper . After over a week with little progress , Derby County called off the move , but when Carroll offered to pay the loan fee so Rangers could sign Sunderland keeper Darren Ward , the deal was revived . Carroll hoped to join Derby on loan for the rest of the 2007–08 season but the move was again held up by Rangers as they refused to release his registration until they found another keeper . After Rangers signed Neil Alexander from Ipswich Town , Carroll was free to sign for Derby , and a deal was completed on deadline day . He signed a three-year contract with the club on 21 January 2008 , and made his debut in a Premier League match against Birmingham City on 2 February 2008 . Carroll could not help the club avoid relegation to the Championship after just one season .\nCarroll started the 2008–09 season as the clubs first choice goalkeeper , but after getting sent off in a 2–1 victory at Norwich City he lost his place and was restricted to making appearances in cup competitions . He was part of the Derby side that reached the 2008–09 Football League Cup semi-final , where they lost 4–3 on aggregate to his former side Manchester United . After Paul Jewell resigned in December 2008 , he was replaced by Nigel Clough . Clough made it clear Carroll was not in his plans and , a week into the 2009–10 season , it was announced that Carrolls contract with The Rams would be cancelled to allow him to move to Danish side Odense BK .\nOdense Boldklub .\nCarroll signed a three-year contract with Danish Superliga side Odense BK on 17 August 2009 . His debut was granted on the very same day and only hours after he had signed the deal , when he managed to keep a clean sheet in the 1–0 win against FC Midtjylland . Having played just 14 Superliga games , he was named 2009 Superliga Goalkeeper of the Year in December 2009 , in a vote amongst the league goalkeepers . In November 2010 , Carroll announced his decision to leave Odense BK in order to return to Britain to be closer to his family . The club soon signed Stefan Wessels as his replacement . Carrolls contract was mutually terminated on 31 January 2011 and he left Odense BK as a free agent , in search of a new club .\n2011 trial spells .\nCarroll was on trial at Sheffield United in March 2011 . However , he conceded two goals within ten minutes and was sent off , which led to a penalty during a reserve match against Barnsley . As a result of his poor performance whilst on trial , he was not offered a contract with the Blades . Later that same month , Carroll joined League Two strugglers Barnet on a trial with a view to a role as player-coach . After the departure of Martin Allen as manager in April 2011 , and with caretaker manager Giuliano Grazioli on a scouting mission , Carroll was appointed as manager for the Herts Senior Cup final against Stevenage , which Barnet won 2–1 . Thus , Carroll won a trophy in his only game as a football manager . He reportedly left the club in protest in April 2011 , as his former Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez was set to take a managerial role in the club . In July 2011 , Carroll joined Preston North End on trial and played in a 7–1 friendly victory at Kendal Town . However , despite a deal for Preston to sign Carroll being close , the club opted to sign Iain Turner instead .\nOFI Crete .\nIn August 2011 Carroll signed a two-year contract with Greek Superleague side OFI Crete . Despite struggling for fitness and form in pre-season , Carroll appeared 16 times for the club , putting in some impressive performances , which made him highly regarded in Greece . He was ranked third in shots saved statistics amid speculation that bigger clubs in Greece were interested in Carroll .\nOlympiacos .\nIn January 2012 Carroll signed a contract with Greek Superleague champions Olympiacos for a reported transfer fee of . His first appearance was against Rubin Kazan in Moscow in the first match for the round of 32 , in the Europa League , coming on as a late substitute after Balázs Megyeri conceded a penalty and was given a red card . Carroll saved the penalty with the first touch of his Olympiacos career and his team went on to win 0–1 . In the return leg , Carroll put in a performance considered legendary by the fans , after producing a string of saves in whilst carrying a visible hamstring injury .\nCarroll became the first choice goalkeeper at the club in 2012–13 and featured in his first Champions League game since February 2005 , when he played in a 2–1 win at Montpellier on 24 October 2012 , after displacing Megyeri who started the opening two European games . In Olympiacos first ten league games , Carroll played a part in a team which conceded only five goals and kept six clean sheets as they won the opening nine games , drawing the other . In an interview with British press , Carroll said that he was happy with his life in Greece and hopeful on extending his contract at Olympiacos . In his first twenty games for Olympiacos in all competitions , he was part of the winning side in eighteen games , drawing the other two , conceded ten goals and kept twelve clean sheets , losing in his twenty-first appearance against Schalke 04 0–1 on 21 November 2012 . Carroll lost his place in the side to Megyeri in January , being relegated to cup appearances as Olympiacos won the double for a second consecutive season .\nNotts County .\nFollowing his departure from Greek Superleague champions , Olympiacos , Carroll signed a one-year contract with Football League One side Notts County on 4 August 2014 . Carroll resigned for the 2015–16 season , he was released at the end of the season . On 15 November 2014 , less than 24 hours after playing an international for Northern Ireland in Bucharest , Romania , Carroll kept a clean sheet as Notts County won 1–0 away at Coventry City .\nLinfield .\nCarroll joined Linfield in 2016 . After suffering a serious knee injury in January 2019 , he left the club in May 2019 but planned to continue his playing career .\nDungannon Swifts .\nAfter a brief period playing for Mid-Ulster Football League junior side FC Mindwell , Carroll returned to the Irish League to sign for Dungannon Swifts in January 2021 .\nInternational career .\nCarroll gained his first full international cap on 21 May 1997 in a game against Thailand . For many years , Carroll fought a losing battle to be Northern Irelands first-choice keeper to the experienced Maik Taylor . Despite this , Carroll had still amassed 19 caps up to September 2006 . The last of these 19 caps came in a Euro 2008 qualifying match against Spain at Windsor Park . Northern Ireland pulled off a memorable 3–2 win , but Carroll had to be substituted after only 12 minutes due to a groin injury .\nAfter a six-year absence from the international team , Carroll was named in the friendly squad to face the Netherlands on 2 June 2012 . He came on as a substitute for the second half , conceding two goals as Northern Ireland lost 6–0 . He made his competitive return to the Northern Ireland team on 7 September 2012 , when he started in Northern Irelands 2–0 defeat away to Russia in their opening qualifier for the 2014 FIFA World Cup .

He played in the 2004 FA Cup Final were Millwall lost 3–0 to Manchester United . He joined Stoke City in the summer of 2005 for a fee of £250,000 but his start at Stoke was hampered by injuries . He struggled to fully recover and after spending time out on loan at Yeovil Town and Walsall he joined Leeds United in January 2008 . After a brief spell at Elland Road Sweeney played for Grimsby Town , Bury , AFC Wimbledon , Dartford and Greenwich Borough .\nCareer .\nMillwall .\nSweeney was born in Glasgow and moved with his family to London when he was three-years-old . He started his career at Millwall , where he made his debut in 2002 , but he had to wait another year for his breakthrough . Sweeney played 34 times for Millwall in 2003–04 and he played a major role in the Lions route to the 2004 FA Cup Final , where he started against Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium , Millwall lost 3–0 . Following the cup final appearance , Millwall received a place in the UEFA Cup for the 2004–05 season , in which Sweeney played a part in the first round of the tournament , where they were defeated by Hungarian side Ferencvárosi .\nStoke City .\nOn 1 July 2005 Sweeney signed for Stoke City for a fee of £250,000 . His start at Stoke was hampered after he injured his back in a pre-season match against Newcastle Town , which ruled him out for the first three months of the 2005–06 . Once he recovered from his injury Sweeney went on to play 20 times scoring once on the final day of the season against Brighton & Hove Albion .\nHe scored against Luton Town in a 2–2 draw early in the 2006–07 season but soon lost his place in the side and joined Yeovil Town on loan in January 2007 . He played eight times for the Golvers before returning to Stoke in April 2007 . On 22 November 2007 he signed a two-month loan deal at Walsall where he made seven appearances .\nLeeds United .\nEarly in the January 2008 transfer window Stoke accepted an undisclosed bid for the midfielder from Leeds United , with whom he swiftly agreed personally terms , and it was announced that he would sign , subject to a medical the following week . He finalised the move on 10 January , joining the club on a two–and–a–half–year deal . Despite starting in the last few games of Dennis Wise reign as Leeds manager , including making his debut away to Crewe and providing the assist for Jermaine Beckfords winning header , Sweeney failed to establish himself under managers Gary McAllister and Simon Grayson .\nGrimsby Town .\nSweeney made a loan move in March 2009 to Grimsby Town , signing with Grimsby until the end of the season , along with Bradford City forward Barry Conlon and fellow Leeds player Jonathan Lund . Sweeney went on to be part of a Grimsby side that would make a late surge in the league , and that would eventually stave off the threat of relegation from the Football League . Following the close of the 2008–2009 season and the end of his loan spell , he was released from his contract at Leeds , following a one and a half year spell at the Yorkshire club . On 3 July 2009 , after much speculation , Sweeney re–signed for The Mariners , on a two–year deal . He scored his first goal for the club against Rotherham United in a 2–1 defeat at home . Sweeney then managed to score a superb volley against his former club Leeds , in the third round of the Football League Trophy at Elland Road . A corner resulted in Leeds keeper Casper Ankergren punching the ball out too Sweeney , who smashed in a left foot volley from the edge of the area , that crashed in off the under side of the cross bar . However Grimsby went on to lose the game 3–1 . On 18 December , Sweeney scored another spectacular goal after hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the in a 1–1 home draw with Morecambe . Sweeney continued to hold down a position in the centre of midfield throughout the 09/10 season . On 12 May 2010 , Sweeney was one of seven players placed on the transfer list by Grimsby manager Neil Woods after their relegation from the football league .\nBury .\nSweeney joined Bury on 25 June 2010 signing a two–year deal . Despite failing to hold down a regular starting place for The Shakers during the 2010–11 season , Sweeney performed consistently when called upon by manager Alan Knill . Following Knills departure , Sweeney entered the fold under Richie Barker following suspensions and injuries to regular midfield duo Damien Mozika and Steven Schumacher eventually helping the club to earn promotion from League Two . Sweeney made 41 appearances in League One , scoring 4 goals during the 2011–12 season and made 21 appearances , scoring 1 goal , in all competitions during the 2012–13 season for Bury before being sold to AFC Wimbledon on 8 January 2013 . During his time at Bury , Sweeney made a total of 95 appearances , which is the most games he has ever played for one club .\nAFC Wimbledon .\nOn 8 January 2013 Sweeney signed for League Two side AFC Wimbledon for a free transfer . After only seven appearances for The Dons , Sweeney suffered a broken foot in a game against Northampton Town on 19 February 2013 at The Cherry Red Records Stadium . The injury put him out of action for the remainder of the 2012–2013 season . He returned during AFC Wimbledons 2013–2014 pre–season campaign , scoring in a behind closed doors game against Gillingham on 2 July 2013 that ended 2–1 to The Gills . Sweeney came on as a substitute for Harry Pell in AFC Wimbledons next friendly game against Dartford on 6 July 2013 at Princes Park , the game ended 2–2 .\nDartford .\nIn August 2014 , he signed for Conference Premier side Dartford on a one-year contract . In May 2015 , Sweeney was released by the club following relegation to the National League South and the expiration of his contract .\nLater career .\nFollowing his release from Dartford Sweeney joined Greenwich Borough in June 2015 .\nCoaching career .\nIn October 2017 , Sweeney moved to Glebe as to take on the role of assistant manager , working with Anwar Uddin . He was appointed manager in January 2019 , but resigned in September the same year .\nControversies .\nIn May 2019 , Sweeneys former Grimsby Town team mate Paul Linwood appeared on the I Had Trials Once podcast on Spotify , in the interview he spoke about his time at the club during the 2009–10 season . Linwood went on to explain that the team was full of alcoholics and spoke of instances where the drinking culture at the club got out of hand .\nSpeaking of Sweeney , Linwood said You’d finish training , Adam Proudlock on the Whatsapp group would say “lads , I’m just having a pint at the Laceby Arms” , and the whole squad would be in there . 15 pints , easy . It was the only pub we could get away with it . It was in a tiny little village , and we were dead inconspicuous – we used to go in our kits ! Even I turned round one day and said “this has gone too far.” We’d had a Monday session – straight after training , we finished boozing about five that morning , and then we were in for training at nine the next day . Adam Proudlock and Peter Sweeney came to pick us up , and both were just the most unbelievable players who had just tossed it off at this point . Those two came to pick me up after a session , and we were drinking cans of Fosters on the way to training , which is out of order because I f***ing hate Fosters !\nGrimsby Town would go on to finish 23rd in League Two and were relegated from the Football League for the first time in their 122 year history .\nHonours .\nMillwall\n- FA Cup runner-up : 2003–04\nStoke City\n- Football League Championship runner–up : 2007–08\nBury\n- Football League Two runner–up : 2010–11\nExternal links .\n- Scotland U21 profile at Fitbastats\n- Scotland B profile at Fitbastats",

    "story": "Max Ernst\nMax Ernst ( 2 April 1891 – 1 April 1976 ) was a German ( naturalised American in 1948 and French in 1958 ) painter , sculptor , graphic artist , and poet . A prolific artist , Ernst was a primary pioneer of the Dada movement and surrealism . He had no formal artistic training , but his experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of frottage—a technique that uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images—and grattage , an analogous technique in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath . He is also noted for his novels consisting of collages .\nBiography .\nEarly life .\nMax Ernst was born in Brühl , near Cologne , the third of nine children of a middle-class Catholic family . His father Philipp was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter , a devout Christian and a strict disciplinarian . He inspired in Max a penchant for defying authority , while his interest in painting and sketching in nature influenced Max to take up painting . In 1909 , Ernst enrolled in the University of Bonn to read philosophy , art history , literature , psychology and psychiatry . He visited asylums and became fascinated with the art work of the mentally ill patients ; he also started painting that year , producing sketches in the garden of the Brühl castle , and portraits of his sister and himself . In 1911 , Ernst befriended August Macke and joined his Die Rheinischen Expressionisten group of artists , deciding to become an artist .\nIn 1912 , he visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne , where works by Pablo Picasso and post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin profoundly influenced him . His work was exhibited that year together with that of the Das Junge Rheinland group , at Galerie Feldman in Cologne , and then in several group exhibitions in 1913 . In his paintings of this period , Ernst adopted an ironic style that juxtaposed grotesque elements alongside Cubist and Expressionist motifs .\nIn 1914 , Ernst met Hans Arp in Cologne . The two became friends and their relationship lasted for fifty years . After Ernst completed his studies in the summer , his life was interrupted by World War I . Ernst was drafted and served both on the Western and the Eastern Fronts . The effect of the war on Ernst was devastating ; in his autobiography , he wrote of his time in the army thus : On the first of August 1914 M [ ax ] .E [ rnst ] . died . He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918 . For a brief period on the Western Front , Ernst was assigned to chart maps , which allowed him to continue painting . Several German Expressionist painters died in action during the war , among them August Macke and Franz Marc .\nDada and surrealism .\nIn 1918 , Ernst was demobilised and returned to Cologne . He soon married art history student Luise Straus , whom he had met in 1914 . In 1919 , Ernst visited Paul Klee in Munich and studied paintings by Giorgio de Chirico . The same year , inspired by de Chirico and mail-order catalogues , teaching-aide manuals and similar sources , he produced his first collages ( notably Fiat modes , a portfolio of lithographs ) , a technique which would dominate his artistic pursuits . Also in 1919 , Ernst , social activist Johannes Theodor Baargeld and several colleagues founded the Cologne Dada group . In 1919–20 , Ernst and Baargeld published various short-lived magazines such as Der Strom , die Schammade and organised Dada exhibitions .\nErnst and Luises son Ulrich Jimmy Ernst was born on 24 June 1920 ; he also became a painter . Ernsts marriage to Luise was short-lived . In 1921 , he met Paul Éluard , who became a lifelong friend . Éluard bought two of Ernsts paintings ( Celebes and Oedipus Rex ) and selected six collages to illustrate his poetry collection Répétitions . A year later the two collaborated on Les malheurs des immortels and then with André Breton , whom Ernst met in 1921 , on the magazine Littérature . In 1922 , unable to secure the necessary papers , Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a ménage à trois with Éluard and his wife Gala in Paris suburb Saint-Brice , leaving behind his wife and son . During his first two years in Paris , Ernst took various odd jobs to make a living and continued to paint . In 1923 , the Éluards moved to a new home in Eaubonne , near Paris , where Ernst painted numerous murals . The same year his works were exhibited at Salon des Indépendants .\nAlthough apparently accepting the ménage à trois , Éluard eventually became more concerned about the affair . In 1924 , he abruptly left , first for Monaco and then for Saigon . He soon asked his wife and Max Ernst to join him ; both had to sell paintings to finance the trip . Ernst went to Düsseldorf and sold a large number of his works to a long-time friend , Johanna Ey , owner of gallery Das Junge Rheinland . After a brief time together in Saigon , the trio decided that Gala would remain with Paul . The Éluards returned to Eaubonne in early September , while Ernst followed them some months later , after exploring more of South-East Asia . He returned to Paris in late 1924 and soon signed a contract with Jacques Viot that allowed him to paint full-time . In 1925 , Ernst established a studio at 22 , rue Tourlaque .\nIn 1925 , Ernst invented a graphic art technique called frottage ( see Surrealist techniques ) , which uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images . He also created the grattage technique , in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath . He used this technique in his famous painting Forest and Dove ( as shown at the Tate Modern ) . The next year he collaborated with Joan Miró on designs for Sergei Diaghilev . With Mirós help , Ernst developed grattage , in which he trowelled pigment from his canvases . He also explored with the technique of decalcomania , which involves pressing paint between two surfaces . Ernst was also active , along with fellow Surrealists , at the Atelier 17 .\nErnst developed a fascination with birds that was prevalent in his work . His alter ego in paintings , which he called Loplop , was a bird . He suggested that this alter-ego was an extension of himself stemming from an early confusion of birds and humans . He said that one night when he was young , he woke up and found that his beloved bird had died ; a few minutes later , his father announced that his sister was born . Loplop often appeared in collages of other artists work , such as Loplop presents André Breton . Ernst drew a great deal of controversy with his 1926 painting The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses : André Breton , Paul Éluard , and the Painter . In 1927 , Ernst married and it is thought his relationship with her may have inspired the erotic subject matter of The Kiss and other works of that year . Ernst appeared in the 1930 film LÂge dOr , directed by the Surrealist Luis Buñuel . Ernst began to sculpt in 1934 and spent time with Alberto Giacometti . In 1938 , the American heiress and artistic patron Peggy Guggenheim acquired a number of Max Ernsts works , which she displayed in her new gallery in London . Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim were married from 1942 to 1946 .\nWorld War II and later life .\nIn September 1939 , the outbreak of World War II caused Ernst to be interned as an undesirable foreigner in Camp des Milles , near Aix-en-Provence , along with fellow Surrealist , Hans Bellmer , who had recently emigrated to Paris . He had been living with his lover and fellow Surrealist painter , Leonora Carrington who , not knowing whether he would return , saw no option but to sell their house to repay their debts and leave for Spain . Thanks to the intercession of Paul Éluard and other friends , including the journalist Varian Fry , he was released a few weeks later . Soon after the German occupation of France , he was arrested again , this time by the Gestapo but managed to escape and flee to America with the help of Peggy Guggenheim , a member of a wealthy American art collecting family , and Fry . Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim arrived in the United States in 1941 and were married at the end of the year . Along with other artists and friends ( Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall ) who had fled from the war and lived in New York City , Ernst helped inspire the development of Abstract expressionism .\nHis marriage to Guggenheim did not last and in Beverly Hills , California in October 1946 , in a double ceremony with Man Ray and Juliet P . Browner , he married Dorothea Tanning . The couple made their home in Sedona , Arizona from 1946 to 1953 , where the high desert landscapes inspired them and recalled Ernsts earlier imagery . Despite the fact that Sedona was remote and populated by fewer than 400 ranchers , orchard workers , merchants and small Native American communities , their presence helped begin what would become an American artists colony . Among the monumental red rocks , Ernst built a small cottage by hand on Brewer Road and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Yves Tanguy . Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists and for Ernst , who compiled his book Beyond Painting and completed his sculptural masterpiece Capricorn while living there . As a result of the book and its publicity , Ernst began to achieve financial success . From the 1950s he lived mainly in France . In 1954 he was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the Venice Biennale . He died at the age of 84 on 1 April 1976 in Paris and was interred at Père Lachaise Cemetery .\nLegacy .\nErnsts son Jimmy Ernst , a well-known German/American abstract expressionist painter , who lived on the south shore of Long Island , died in 1984 . His memoirs , A Not-So-Still Life , were published shortly before his death . Max Ernsts grandson Eric and his granddaughter Amy are both artists and writers .\nMax Ernsts life and career are examined in Peter Schamonis 1991 documentary Max Ernst . Dedicated to the art historian Werner Spies , it was assembled from interviews with Ernst , stills of his paintings and sculptures , and the memoirs of his wife Dorothea Tanning and son Jimmy . The 101-minute German film was released on DVD with English subtitles by Image Entertainment .\nThe Max Ernst Museum opened in 2005 in his home town Brühl , Germany . It is housed in a late-classicist 1844 building integrated with a modern glass pavilion . The historic ballroom was once a popular social venue visited by Ernst in his youth . The collection spans 70 years of his career including paintings , drawings , frottages , collages , nearly the entire lithographic works , over 70 bronze sculptures . and more than 700 documents and photographs by Man Ray , Henri Cartier-Bresson , Lee Miller , and others . The core of the collection dates back to 1969 with works donated to the City of Brühl by the artist . Thirty-six paintings , gifts from the artist to his fourth wife Dorothea Tanning , are on permanent loan from the Kreissparkasse Köln . Some noteworthy works include the sculptures The King playing with the Queen ( 1944 ) and Teaching Staff for a School of Murderers ( 1967 ) . The museum also host temporary exhibitions by other artist .\nThe Menil Collection , in Houston , Texas houses a significant collection of surrealist art including well over 100 pieces by Max Ernst . Notable paintings include In Praise of Freedom ( 1926 ) , Loplop Presents Loplop ( 1930 ) , Day and Night ( 1941–1942 ) , Surrealism and Painting ( 1942 ) , Euclid ( 1945 ) , A Swarm of Bees in the Palais de Justice ( 1960 ) , The Marriage of Heaven and Earth ( 1964 ) .

He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93 .\nSoleri authored several books , including The Bridge Between Matter & Spirit is Matter Becoming Spirit and Arcology - City In the Image of Man .\nEarly life .\nSoleri was born in Turin , Italy , Europe . He was awarded his laurea ( masters degree ) in architecture from the Politecnico di Torino in 1946 . He visited the United States in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona , and at Taliesin in Spring Green , Wisconsin . During this time , he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art .\nIn 1950 , Soleri , with his wife Colly ( née Corolyn Woods ) , returned to Italy where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory , Ceramica Artistica Solimene , in Vietri on the Amalfi coast .\nSoleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and silt-cast architectural structures . For more than 40 years , proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work . Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at Arcosanti and Cosanti in Arizona .\nIn 1956 , Soleri settled in Scottsdale , Arizona , with Colly and the elder of their two daughters ; the younger was born in Arizona . He began building Arcosanti in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students , as a place to test his urban design hypotheses . This urban laboratory ( so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable , who at the time was the architectural critic of The NY Times ) became internationally renowned .\nPaolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in urban planning . They established the Cosanti Foundation , a 501-3C educational non-profit foundation . Soleris philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin .\nSoleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery , beside his wife .\nArcosanti .\nThe Cosanti Foundations major project is Arcosanti . Arcosanti , as originally designed by Soleri , was intended for 5,000 people ; it has been in construction since 1970 . Located near Cordes Junction , about north of Phoenix and visible from Interstate I-17 in central Arizona , the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleris concept of Arcology , architecture coherent with ecology . Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city , designed to : maximize human interaction with ready access to shared , cost-effective infrastructural services ; conserve water and reduce sewage ; minimize the use of energy , raw materials and land ; reduce waste and environmental pollution ; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment . In 2010 , construction was underway to complete Arcosantis Greenhouse Apron , but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleris death in 2013 .\nArcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology . Soleris other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean ( Nova Noah ) , et al . ( see : Arcology : City in the Image of Man ) . Since 1970 , over 7000 people have participated in Arcosantis construction . Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network .\nOther achievements .\nThe International Architecture Symposium Mensch und Raum ( Man and Space ) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1984 received international attention . Paolo Soleri participated with , among others : Justus Dahinden , Dennis Sharp , Bruno Zevi , Jorge Glusberg , Otto Kapfinger , Frei Otto , Pierre Vago , Ernst Gisel , and Ionel Schein .\nSoleri was a distinguished lecturer in the College of Architecture at Arizona State University and a member of the Lindisfarne Association .\nIn 1966 , Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the Paolo Soleri Amphitheater in Santa Fe , New Mexico . It was built for the IAIA ( Institute of American Indian Arts ) on what is now the campus of the Santa Fe Indian School using large silt cast forms . The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws .\nA landmark exhibition , City in the Image of Man - The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri , organized in 1970 by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington , DC , traveled extensively thereafter in the U.S . and Canada , breaking records for attendance . Two Suns Arcology , A Concept for Future Cities opened in 1976 at the Xerox Square Center in Rochester , New York . In 1989 , Paolo Soleri Habitats : Ecologic Minutiae , an exhibition of arcologies , space habitats , and bridges , was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences . More recently , Soleris Cities , Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in Scottsdale , AZ . A Soleri bell appears in the film What the *Bleep* Do We Know ? His work has been exhibited worldwide .\nIn 1976 , Paolo Soleri was a key participant at UN Habitat I , the first UN forum on human settlements , held it Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , North America . Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller .\nThe Paolo Soleri Archives , the collection of Soleris drawings and writings , is located at Arcosanti . The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch under the direction of Tomiaki Tamura , a Cosanti Board Trustee and Arcosantis Director of Special Projects . Tomiaki Tamura resides at Arcosanti .\nAn interview with Soleri was featured in the environmental documentary The 11th Hour ( 2007 ) .\nOn 10 December 2010 , the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed . The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art . The pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleris design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale . The bridge is incorporated into a plaza including silt cast artwork , as well as a large bell assembly called The Goldwater Bell , also designed by Paolo Soleri .\nThe feature-length documentary film ( 2013 ) contains interviews with Morley Safer , Paul Goldberger , Catherine Hardwicke , Will Bruder , Jean-Michel Cousteau , Steven Holl , and Eric Lloyd Wright .\nAwards .\nSoleri received fellowships from the Graham Foundation and from the Guggenheim Foundation ( 1964 , Architecture , Planning , & Design ) . He was awarded three honorary doctorates and several awards from design groups worldwide :\n- 1963 – American Institute of Architects Gold Medal for Craftmanship\n- 1981 – Gold Medal at the World Bienniale of Architecture held by the International Academy of Architecture in Sofia , Bulgaria\n- 1984 – Silver Medal of the Academie d Architecture in Paris\n- 1996 – Honorary Fellow , Royal Institute of British Architects\n- 2000 – Leone doro at the Venice Biennale of Architecture for his lifelong achievement\n- 2006 – Cooper Hewitt National Design Award for lifetime achievement\nSexual abuse allegation .\nIn October 2010 , Daniela Soleri – Paolo Soleris daughter – resigned from the Cosanti Foundation board , citing abuse by her father . She stated that some of Soleris inner circle had been told decades earlier , but nothing had been done about it at the time . After the resignation , Soleri stepped down as chairman , but the board made no public statement on the reasons .\nAfter the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art had a major retrospective exhibition on Paolo Soleri in October 2017 , Daniela published an article on the website Medium on 13 November 2017 accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse , writing : In my early adolescence , my father , an architect and craftsman , began sexually molesting me , eventually attempting rape when I was 17 . Encouraged to publish the article by the #MeToo movement , Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her fathers colleagues but received little response :\nIn the article , Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleris work and ideas . However , she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity . Of her father , Daniela wrote :\nAs noted in Dezeen , Danielas article suggested that she had approached The New York Times or other news publishers to discuss her fathers abuse , but had been turned away . The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleris :\nCurbed editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote [ Daniela ] Soleris account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth , but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful . Keith noted that architecture as a profession hasnt ( yet ) experienced its Weinstein moment , referring to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the resulting Weinstein effect of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries . In a 2018 Curbed article , Hilary George-Parkin said : While Hollywood , tech , sports , media , politics , the restaurant industry , and others are reeling from high-profile revelations and resignations , the design world has remained—with the notable exception of Daniela Soleris account of sexual abuse by her father , architect Paolo Soleri—mostly undisturbed in the public realm .",

    "story": "Polish Peoples Party\nThe Polish Peoples Party ( ) , abbreviated to PSL ( traditionally translated as Polish Peasants Party ) , often shortened to ( the populars ) is an agrarian Christian-democratic political party in Poland . It is a member of the European Peoples Party and the European Peoples Party group in the European Parliament .\nThe partys name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Galician Poland , which sent MPs to the parliament in Vienna .\nHistory .\nBefore 1945 .\nThe party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of Rzeszow under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe ( Peoples Party ) . The party changed its name in 1903 to what its known as now . The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful , seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century . In the Second Polish Republic there were a few parties named PSL ( Polish Peoples Party Wyzwolenie , Polish Peoples Party Piast , Polish Peoples Party Left and others ) until they were removed by the Sanacja regime ( see also Peoples Party ) .\nDuring this time , there were two parties using the term Polish Peoples Party , namely Polish Peoples Party Piast and Polish Peoples Party Wyzwolenie ( which were merged into Peoples Party with Stronnictwo Chłopskie ) . During World War II , PSL took part in forming the Polish government in exile .\nUnder the communist regime .\nAfter the war , Stanisław Mikołajczyk , a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile , returned to communist-dominated Poland , where he joined the provisional government and rebuilt PSL . The party hoped to win the Yalta Conference-mandated elections and help establish a parliamentary system in Poland . The communists formed a rival peasant party allied with them . The 1947 parliamentary election was heavily rigged , with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80 percent of the vote . Many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly .\nMikołajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life . The communists then forced the remains of Mikołajczyks PSL to unite with the pro-communist Peoples Party to form the United Peoples Party . The ZSL was a governing partner in the ruling coalition .\nAfter the fall of the regime .\nAround the time of the fall of communism several PSLs were recreated , including Porozumienie Ludowe , Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe-Odrodzenie , and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe ( Wilanów faction ) . In 1989 most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the Solidarity grouping , and in 1990 changed its name to PSL .\nIt remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s , entering into coalitions with the postcommunist Democratic Left Alliance . In the 2001 parliamentary elections , PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance , an alliance which later broke down . Since then , PSL has moved towards more centrist and conservative policies .\nAfter 2004 .\nThe party ran in the 2004 European Parliament election as part of the European Peoples Party ( EPP ) and received 6% of the vote , giving it 4 of 54 Polish seats in the European Parliament . In the 2005 general election , the party received 7% of votes , giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and 2 in the Senate . In the 2007 parliamentary elections , the party placed fourth , with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats , and entered into a governing coalition with the victor , the centre-right conservative Civic Platform .\nIn European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009 .\nIn the 2011 national parliamentary election , Polish Peoples Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and 2 mandates in the Senate . At the 2015 parliamentary election , the PSL dropped to 5.13 percent of the vote , just barely over the 5 percent threshold . With 16 seats , it was the smallest of the five factions in the Sejm .\nSince then PSL has lost even more support to PiS during the 2018 Polish local elections when they lost 87 seats and dropped to 12.07% unlike the 23.9% they got at the last local elections . After this , the party became junior partner in coalitions with Civic Coalition and SLD .\nIn 2019 European election , PSL won 3 seats as a part of the European Coalition .\nFor parliamentary elections in the same year , PSL decided to create centrist and Christian-democratic coalition with or without Civic Platform named as Polish Coalition . However , PO recreated Civic Coalition with Modern and small left-wing parties ( although without major left-wing parties ) . Polish Coalition , apart from PSL , consists of Kukiz15 , Union of European Democrats and another liberal , catholic and regionalist organisations . This coalition resulted in election of 30 members . Majority of them ( 20 ) were members of PSL .\nIdeology .\nThe partys platform is strongly based on neo-agrarianism . On social and ethical issues , PSL opposes abortion , same-sex marriage , soft drug decriminalization , euthanasia and death penalty .\nIn 2019 , the party adopted ( as part of an agreement with Kukiz15 ) in the partys platform direct democracys postulates , including single-member districts and obligatory referendum .\nElection results .\nSupport .\nThe Partys traditional support base consisted of farmers , peasants and rural voters . Voters are generally more social conservative than voters of Civic Platform . The main concurrent in rural areas is national conservative Law and Justice ( PiS ) .\nIn the 2010s the party started to lose support between rural voters ( especially in southeast of Poland ) . In 2019 election PSL gained surprisingly significant support in cities and won mandates ( e . g . in Warsaw and Wrocław ) .\nLeadership .\nChairman :\n- Roman Bartoszcze ( 1990–1991 )\n- Waldemar Pawlak ( 1991–1997 )\n- Jarosław Kalinowski ( 1997–2004 )\n- Janusz Wojciechowski ( 2004–2005 )\n- Waldemar Pawlak ( 2005–2012 )\n- Janusz Piechociński ( 2012–2015 )\n- Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz ( 2015–present )",

He passed his Abitur in 1966 and worked in agriculture before beginning a course of study in agronomy in 1968 , finishing in 1973 as a qualified engineer . During his studies Carstensen became a member of the Landsmannschaft Troglodytia im Coburger Convent and did not leave the organisation until 1998 . In 1976 he passed the Second State Examination ( Zweites Staatsexamen ) to become a teacher , following which he was employed as a teacher of agriculture at the Bredstedt Agricultural School and also as an economics adviser in the Agricultural Ministry of Schleswig-Holstein until 1983 .\nFamily .\nPeter Harry Carstensen is widowed and has two daughters . His younger daughter is the ceramicist Anja-Christina Carstensen . In August 2004 the Bild newspaper hunted for a new wife with Carstensen’s agreement - a decision that he later regretted .\nOn his 60th birthday , Carstensen publicly announced his new relationship with Sandra Thomsen , a lawyer born in 1971 . Two and a half years later — on 31 December 2009 — the two were married in the Friesenstube of the Island Hotel Arfsten in Wrixum .\nPolitical career .\nCarstensen has been a member of the CDU since 1971 .

    "story": "Sir Henry Havelock-Allan , 1st Baronet\nLieutenant General Sir Henry Marshman Havelock-Allan , 1st Baronet ( 6 August 1830 – 30 December 1897 ) was a British soldier and politician . Allan in the surname was added in March 1880 .\nEarly life .\nHavelock was born in Cawnpore , India on 6 August 1830 , the son of Major General Sir Henry Havelock and his wife , Hannah née Marshman , the daughter of the missionaries Joshua and Hannah Marshman .\nMilitary career .\nHavelock was commissioned as an Ensign in the 39th Regiment of Foot in March 1846 , and joined the Regiment in India . Moving to the 86th Foot as a Lieutenant in June 1848 , he transferred to the 10th Regiment of Foot in February 1852 . He served in the Persian campaign of 1856–57 , and was back in India at the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in May 1857 .\nOn 16 July 1857 at Cawnpore , the 64th Regiment had suffered badly under artillery fire . When the enemy was seen rallying their last 24-pounder , the order was given to advance , and Havelock immediately placed himself , on his horse , in front of the centre of the 64th , opposite the muzzle of the gun and moved on at a foot pace , in the face of shot and grape fired by the enemy . The advance went steadily on , led by Havelock and finally the gun was rushed and taken by the 64th . For this deed , Havelock was awarded the Victoria Cross . On 25 September 1857 he was badly wounded in the Siege of Lucknow .\nOn returning to England in 1860 , Havelock joined his regiment , now the 18th Foot ( Royal Irish Regiment ) , at Shorncliffe .

In 1877 , he attended the Russo-Turkish War in the same capacity . He was promoted to colonel on 17 June 1868 , and major general on 18 March 1878 .\nIll health forced Havelock to retire from the active list on 9 December 1881 , with the honorary rank of lieutenant general . However , when the Anglo-Egyptian War broke out the following year , he made his way to the British headquarters in Ismaïlia telling a war correspondent : Dont for goodness sake mention me in your despatches , for my wife thinks Im somewhere on the Riviera , but I could not resist coming here to see the fun . He petitioned the British commander , Sir Garnet Wolseley , for a role on the staff ; but Wolseley refused , writing to his wife :\nNonetheless , Havelock was able to see action at the battles of Kassassin and Tel el-Kebir , where he supposedly led a charge armed with nothing but a riding crop .\nBaronetcy and Member of Parliament .\nIn 1858 Havelock was granted the baronetcy , originally intended for his father ( who died a year earlier ) , and he and his mother were granted a parliamentary pension of £1,000 a year . He later went to England and became a Member of Parliament in 1874 for his fathers birth-town of Sunderland until 1881 . He inherited Blackwell Grange , the former property of his cousin Robert Allan , changed his surname to Havelock-Allan , ( as was required by the will of the latter ) and became an MP for South East Durham from 1885 to 1892 .\nDeath .\nHavelock was re-elected in 1895 and also became Colonel of the Royal Irish Regiment , stationed in India , that year . It was there that he was killed by Afridi clansmen on the Afghanistan side of the Khyber Pass in 1897 and he was later buried in Rawalpindi .\nWorks .\nIn 1867 , Havelock published his Three Main Military Questions of the Day , which addressed the issues of a Home Reserve Army , improved economic military tenure of India and the effects of breechloading arms on cavalry .",

    "story": "Theresa Villiers\nTheresa Anne Villiers ( born 5 March 1968 ) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs from 2019 to 2020 . She has been the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Chipping Barnet since 2005 . Villiers was Minister of State for Transport from 2010 to 2012 and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 2012 until 2016 .\nEarly life .\nVilliers was born in Hunstanton , Norfolk in 1968 , the third child of George Edward Villiers by his marriage to Anne Virginia Threlfall ; she has two elder brothers , Edward and Henry . On her fathers side , she is a descendant of Edward Ernest Villiers ( 1806–1843 ) , brother of George Villiers , 4th Earl of Clarendon , Thomas Hyde Villiers , Charles Pelham Villiers , and Henry Montagu Villiers and a direct descendant of King Edward II .\nGrowing up in North London , she was educated at the independent Francis Holland School . Villiers gained a Bachelor of Laws ( LLB ) degree with first-class honours in 1990 from the University of Bristol , and a year later the postgraduate degree of Bachelor of Civil Law ( BCL ) from Jesus College , Oxford . After university , she qualified for the bar at the Inner Temple , and worked as a lecturer at Kings College London from 1994 until 1999 .\nMember of the European Parliament .\nVilliers was elected as a Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) for the London constituency in 1999 , and was re-elected in 2004 . She stood down after the 2005 general election when she was elected as the Member of Parliament ( United Kingdom ) ( MP ) for Chipping Barnet .\nShe served as Deputy Leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament between 2001 and 2002 . She also served as a member of the governing board of the Conservative Party during this period .\nMember of Parliament .\nIn 2003 , following Sir Sydney Chapmans announcement that he would retire at the following election , Villiers was selected as the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Chipping Barnet . Although Chapmans majority at the 2001 general election had only been 2,701 votes , the party viewed Chipping Barnet to be quite a safe Conservative seat , and Villiers held it at the 2005 general election with an increased majority of 5,960 votes , which she increased again to 11,927 in 2010 . Her majority dropped to 7,656 in 2015 , and was reduced to just 353 in 2017 . However , Villiers majority rose to 1,212 in the 2019 general election , despite her percentage share of the vote going down .\nUpon her election to the House of Commons in 2005 , she resigned from her seat in the European Parliament ; it went to Syed Kamall , the next candidate on the Conservatives regional list for London . Villiers now lives at Arkley in her constituency , and formerly lived at Hillsborough Castle .\nVilliers was sworn of the Privy Council on 9 June 2010 .\nShadow Cabinet .\nIn December 2005 , following the election of David Cameron as Conservative Party Leader , Villiers was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet after just seven months in the UK Parliament , as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury . In July 2007 , Cameron promoted her to Shadow Secretary of State for Transport .\nGovernment .\nFollowing the 2010 general election , the Conservatives , short of an overall majority , formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats . This required positions in Cabinet to be awarded to Lib Dem MPs , so Villiers did not become Secretary of State for Transport as might have been expected in the event of a majority Conservative government taking office . That role went instead to Philip Hammond , who had shadowed the post of Chief Secretary to the Treasury . Villiers instead became a Minister of State at the Department for Transport .\nVilliers was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in September 2012 , but continued to spend three days a week in her North London constituency of Chipping Barnet . Her time in Northern Ireland gained mixed reviews . She made a speech in February 2016 defending the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British Army , which had been accused of colluding with loyalist murderers in the Loughinisland massacre . The Police Ombudsman who investigated the murders , Dr . Michael Maguire , later stated with regard to law enforcement authorities colluding with the murderers : I have no hesitation in unambiguously determining that collusion is a significant feature of the Loughinisland murders .\nVilliers had said that a pernicious counter-narrative of the Troubles was emerging whereby responsibility for acts of terrorism was being shifted onto the security forces through allegations of collusion , misuse of agents and informers or other forms of unlawful activity .\nVilliers was one of the six cabinet ministers who came out in support of Brexit during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum . Following the referendum , on 14 July 2016 , Villiers resigned from her position as Northern Ireland Secretary after stating that new Prime Minister Theresa May had offered her a post in the Cabinet which was not one which I felt I could take on .\nDuring the referendum , 62.2% of voters in her constituency ( based on a 72.1% turnout ) , voted to remain in the European Union . After the referendum , Villiers has continued to support efforts to leave the EU .\nVilliers was appointed Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs by Boris Johnson upon him becoming Prime Minister in July 2019 . She left the government in the post-Brexit cabinet reshuffle .\nIn June 2020 The Times newspaper reported that the hold up in the formation of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament since the 2019 United Kingdom general election had been due to Villiers appointment having been dismissed by the Prime Minister for her defiance of the Governments whip on a vote where she supported an amendment which would have banned the import of chlorinated chicken products from the US in upcoming post-Brexit trade negotiations .\nQueens portraits .\nIn July 2019 , Lord Maginnis claimed that Villiers had signed off a £10,000 settlement with a Northern Ireland Offices civil servant , Lee Hegarty , who claimed that under human rights legislation it was unfair to him to have to work where he was offended by portraits of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh .\nLord Maginnis also claimed in the House of Lords that , following the settlement , Villiers continued removing portraits and substituted them with Northern Irish landscapes . Villiers did not consider Hegartys suggestion of replacing the said portraits of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh with photographs of the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland .\nFollowing the media reports , her successor as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , Julian Smith , requested an internal review into the decision to take down portraits of the Queen from Stormont House , while Arlene Foster , DUPs leader , stated on Twitter : It is beyond parody that there is a dispute over a portrait of Her Majesty the Queen , our head of state .\nParliamentary expenses and second home .\nShe also has a house in Arkley in her North London constituency of Chipping Barnet . The house , a semi-detached property that she bought for £296,500 in May 2004 , is an eight-minute drive away from High Barnet tube station , from which commuters can reach Westminster in about forty-five minutes .\nPolitical opinions .\nVilliers supported the temporary suspension of Ken Livingstone , then-Mayor of London , by the Adjudication Panel for England , which examined the case after a complaint from the Board of Deputies of British Jews to the Standards Board for England .\nTheresa Villiers is a member of , and since 2017 Vice-Chair , of Conservative Friends of Israel .\nOn 19 July 2018 she was the only MP of any party to attend a rally of about 200–300 Jewish and other persons called by the Campaign Against Antisemitism ( CAA ) in Parliament Square , London , to protest against Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party . She has , on previous occasions , attended CAA protests similar to that of 19 July 2018 against anti-semitism within Labour .\nShe has spoken out publicly in support of Iranian resistance to the Iranian regime at an event in Paris in 2017 , organised by the National Council of Resistance of Iran . The NCRI is considered by some analysts to be a front organisation for the Mojahedin-e-Khalq ( MEK ) , which was once listed by the US as a terror organisation .\nSince September 2008 , Villiers has dedicated a considerable proportion of her public announcements to aviation policy , specifically the expansion of airports in the South East of England . Villiers underlined that despite differences of opinion , the Coalition governments policy was opposed to a third runway at Heathrow airport .\nShe has also spoken out against Boris Johnsons favoured proposal for a new London airport to be built in the Thames Estuary , and alternative expansions at Gatwick and Stansted airports , arguing that airlines should make greater use of the UKs regional airports , though some regional airports themselves have expressed concern about being adversely affected by capacity shortages in the South East . Villiers favours construction of a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham and Manchester , arguing that flyers could use capacity at airports such as Birmingham International and Manchester International Airport .\nIn May 2017 , Villiers announced that she fundamentally supports the ban on hunting of wild animals with dogs but suggested that there remains scope for reform of the Hunting Act 2004 .\nIn September 2019 at that years Conservative Party Conference , Villiers set out plans to end live exports of farm animals , ban primates from being kept as pets and for cats to be microchipped .\nPersonal life .\nVilliers married fellow barrister Sean Wilken in 1997 , and the following year they co-wrote a book on matters of contract and quasi-contract law , which was published by a major publishing house . They are now divorced .\nExternal links .\n- Question Time February 2006 BBC ( RealPlayer )",

    "story": "Walton Newbold\nJohn Turner Walton Newbold ( 8 May 1888 – 20 February 1943 ) , generally known as Walton Newbold , was the first of the four Communist Party of Great Britain members to be elected as MPs in the United Kingdom .\nBiography .\nEarly years .\nJohn Turner Walton Newbold was born in Culcheth , Lancashire , on 8 May 1888 , and was educated at Buxton College and the University of Manchester .\nOn leaving university , Newbold lectured in history and politics , and was engaged in industrial and economic research . In 1908 , he joined the Fabian Society , connected with the Labour Party , and then the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) in 1910 . In line with the ILPs pacifist position on World War I , he joined the No Conscription Fellowship , and was a conscientious objector , although he was in any case found physically unfit for military service . He did a great deal of research into the arms trade and its international connections in the late 19th/early 20th centuries . Whilst still a research student , he married fellow socialist Marjory Neilson on 16 June 1916 .\nPolitical career .\nIn 1917 Newbold joined the Labour educational Plebs League and the British Socialist Party ( BSP ) . He had a number of articles published in The Call , the paper of the BSP . By 1920 , he was a committed communist , stating my loyalty , at any rate , is now - as it has been for two and a half years - first and foremost to the position of the Third International . In 1921 he resigned from the ILP and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain , becoming a member of its first central committee .\nIn the 1922 general election , Newbold was elected to represent the Motherwell constituency in the House of Commons . Locally his wife Marjory was well known in working class and socialist groups , from leading social Sunday schools , and adult education and campaigns , and some say he was supported because he was Madges man . Newbold received the support of the Labour Party , but unlike many other Communist candidates , including Shapurji Saklatvala who was elected in the same general election , he stood under the label Communist . Additionally , he was refused permission to take the Labour whip and to sit with the Labour group . As such , he is sometimes counted as the first Communist MP in Britain , although others cite Cecil LEstrange Malone , who switched from the Liberal Party in 1920 , as the first Communist MP .\nSaklatvala was accepted into the Labour Partys parliamentary caucus but while Newbold applied for the same he was rejected . This did not stop Saklatvala and Newbold from joint activity , however , and the pair attempted to raise the demands of the unemployed and the cause of cheap housing and lower rents whenever possible . Newbold wound up being suspended from the House in May 1923 over his actions with respect to the Curzon ultimatum during the French occupation of the Ruhr .\nNewbold was sometimes seen as ineffective in Parliament , mocked by many other MPs for his old and frequently dirty clothing , but focused on producing propaganda for the Communist Party . He lost his seat in the 1923 general election , after just over a year in Parliament . Increasingly disillusioned with communism , he resigned from the party in 1924 and rejoined the Labour Party . In 1928 Newbold joined the Social Democratic Federation , and edited its journal , Social Democrat , from 1929 until 1931 , when he supported the National Labour split from Labour .\nHe stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate in Epping in the 1929 general election . In the same year he was appointed to the Macmillan Enquiry into the operation of banking in the UK .\nDeath and legacy .\nNewbold died in February 1943 , aged 54 .\nList of works .\n- 1916 : How Europe Armed for War 1871 - 1914\n- 1917 : Socialism and Militarism\n- 1917 : Capitalism and Imperialism\n- 1920 : Impression of the Communist Unity Convention\n- 1922 : Egypt and the Entente\n- 1922 : What is the League of Nations—Anyway ?\n- 1923 : Communism & the Labour Party\n- 1923 : The Political Situation in Great Britain\n- 1933 : Democracy , Debts and Disarmament\nSources consulted .\n- Enemy Within the Empire , Australian League of Rights\n- The tasks awaiting the Communist Party , Weekly Worker\n- A .

Previously , she served as editor-in-chief of the peer-reviewed journal Science from 2013 to 2016 . McNutt holds a visiting appointment at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography . She is a member of the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine advisory committee for the Division on Earth and Life Studies and the Forum on Open Science . McNutt chaired the NASEM climate intervention committee who delivered two reports in 2015 .\nMcNutt was the 15th director of the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) ( the first woman to hold the post ) as well as science adviser to the United States Secretary of the Interior . Before working for USGS , McNutt was president and chief executive officer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ( MBARI ) , an oceanographic research center in the United States , professor of marine geophysics at the Stanford University School of Earth Sciences and professor of marine geophysics at University of California , Santa Cruz .\nFamily and education .\nMcNutts father was a small business owner and her mother was a college-educated homemaker . In an interview with the National Academy of Sciences , McNutt said that in their household , womens education was a tradition and a norm , and that her parents encouraged McNutt and her sisters academically .\nShe was valedictorian of her class at the Northrop Collegiate School ( now The Blake School ) in Minneapolis , graduating in 1970 . She received a bachelors degree in physics summa cum laude , Phi Beta Kappa , from Colorado College in 1973 . As a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow , she then studied geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography where she earned a PhD in earth sciences in 1978 . Her dissertation was titled Continental and Oceanic Isostasy . McNutt is a National Association of Underwater Instructors ( NAUI ) -certified scuba diver and she trained in underwater demolition and explosives handling with the Underwater Demolition Team ( UDT ) of the United States Navy and the United States Navy SEALs .\nMarcia Kemper McNutt was married first to Marcel Hoffmann , who died in 1988 . They had three daughters : Meredith McNutt Hoffmann and identical twins Dana and Ashley Hoffmann . Ashley Hoffmann was Miss Rodeo California in 2009 . Marcia McNutt is also a horse enthusiast and enjoys barrel racing on her mare Lulu .\nMcNutt is one of six women scientists featured in the 1995 PBS ( WGBH-TV ) series , Discovering Women . How she excelled in science with a household of young daughters and the help of housekeeper Ann and her daughter is described by Jocelyn Steinke in A portrait of a woman as a scientist : breaking down barriers created by gender-role stereotypes .\nMcNutt and Ian Young , an MBARI ships captain , were married in 1996 .\nEarly years .\nAfter a brief appointment at the University of Minnesota , McNutt worked for three years on earthquake prediction at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park , California . In 1982 , she became assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and in 1988 was appointed Griswold Professor of Geophysics . She previously served as director of the Joint Program in Oceanography and Applied Ocean Science and Engineering , a cooperative effort of MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .\nResearch .\nShe participated in 15 major oceanographic expeditions and served as chief scientist on more than half of them . She published about 100 peer-reviewed scientific articles . Her research has included studies of ocean island volcanism in French Polynesia , continental break-up in the Western United States , and uplift of the Tibet plateau .\nMcNutt has made notable contributions to the understanding of the rheology and strength of the lithosphere . She showed that young volcanoes could flex the lithosphere , influencing the elevation of nearby volcanoes , and used a 3-D analysis of topography and gravity data to show that the Australian plate could be strong on short time scales and weak on long scales . She also showed how subducting ocean plates could weaken and identified a large topographic feature called the South Pacific superswell .\nMonterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute .\nMcNutt was president and CEO of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ( MBARI ) from 1997 to 2009 . During that time the RV Western Flyer , MBARIs research vessel , made expeditions from Canada to Baja California and the Hawaiian Islands . MBARI built the Monterey Accelerated Research System ( MARS ) , the first deep-sea cabled observatory in the continental United States .\nU.S . Geological Survey .\nAppointment .\nIn July 2009 , McNutt was announced as President Obamas nominee to be the next director of the United States Geological Survey and science adviser to the United States Secretary of the Interior . The Senate unanimously approved her nomination on October 21 . She was the first woman to lead the USGS since its establishment in 1879 . Secretary Ken Salazar endorsed McNutt for the position . In a television interview following Obamas announcement , McNutt said :\nBP oil spill .\nDuring her first year , four major events impacted USGS in quick succession : a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti , an 8.0 earthquake in Chile , the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull and the BP oil spill .\nIn May 2010 , McNutt headed the Flow Rate Technical Group which attempted to measure the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Preliminary reports from the group said that the rate of the oil spill was at least twice and possibly up to five times as much as previously acknowledged . Subsequent estimates , based on six independent methodologies , were four times the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . A refined estimate based on new pressure readings , data , and analysis , released by the United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and McNutt in August , said that 4.9 million barrels ( with uncertainty of plus or minus approximately 10 percent ) of oil had leaked from the well until it was capped on July 15 . The disaster was the largest ever accidental spill of oil into marine waters .\nIn a two-day deposition during October 2012 , McNutt was questioned by lawyers for BP , for the Justice Department , for plaintiffs , and for the Gulf states . Subject to approval by U.S . federal courts , BP agreed to a settlement in November 2012 in which the company pleaded guilty to felony charges of misconduct or neglect concerning eleven deaths at the explosion site . The company agreed to pay US$4.5 billion including US$1.256 billion in criminal fines . As of 2012 , BP may still be liable for US$5.4 to US$31 billion in civil fines under the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act .\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility .\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) filed a lawsuit against the Department of the Interior and a complaint about a NOAA scientist in the Flow Rate Technical Group which McNutt led . The group felt that government scientists understated the flow rate of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .\nUSGS peer review process .\nMcNutt participated in the reversal of a 2006 USGS policy that required agency scientists to submit their work to two internal reviewers and obtain a sign-off from a higher level official before submitting their work to external journals who then applied their own peer-review process . Scientists can now have both internal and external reviews simultaneously and the internal process is reduced to one internal review plus sign-off by the USGS Office of Science Quality and Integrity .\nAfghan mineral wealth .\nIn September 2011 , a USGS team including Jack H .

Tucker published a report which they presented at the Afghan embassy in Washington , DC , detailing 57 information packages about Areas of Interest ( AOIs ) that total at least 1,000,000 metric tons of untapped mineral deposits they have found in Afghanistan . Scientific American speculated that replacing opium and Taliban strongholds with a mining bonanza could change U.S . foreign policy and world stability . This report , which points to resources that The New York Times said in 2010 were worth 1 trillion , was put into the public domain . McNutt said at the time :\nMap of Jupiters moon Io .\nIn 2011 and online in 2012 , USGS released a geologic surface map of Jupiters moon Io , which is the most volcanically active body in our solar system , about twenty-five times more active than earth . David Williams of Arizona State University was the project lead . The maps are made of the best images from NASAs Voyager 1 and 2 missions ( acquired in 1979 ) as well as the spacecraft Galileo ( 1995–2003 ) named for Galileo Galilei who discovered Jupiters moons in 1610 . McNutt said :\nAnimal extinction and disease .\nIn 2012 , USGS declared the blue-tailed skink named Emoia impar extinct because none have been observed in their home the Hawaiian Islands since the 1960s . McNutt , quoted by John Platt for Scientific American , said :\nIn a press release , McNutt introduced a lecture by David Blehert , a USGS research scientist , speaking on white nose syndrome which may afflict six species of North American bats and may have far-reaching ecological consequences :\nMcNutt commented on work by lead researcher Carol Meteyer and others from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center and the National Institutes of Health in November 2012 :\nFederal Big Data initiative .\nMcNutt spoke on a panel of leaders of US agencies ( OSTP , NSF , NIH , DOE , DOD , DARPA and USGS ) who rolled out the Obama administrations Big Data Research and Development Initiative . Tom Kalil of the Office of Science and Technology Policy said , By improving our ability to extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of digital data , the initiative promises to help accelerate the pace of discovery in science and engineering , strengthen our national security , and transform teaching and learning . USGS announced the latest awardees for grants it issues through its John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis .\nEnergy : fossil fuels , fracking and biofuel .\nReuters reported that USGS released into the public domain a new estimate of the worlds oil and gas resources , the first such report since 2000 . Excluding the U.S . the USGS found : 565 billion barrels of conventional oil and 5,606 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered conventional natural gas in 171 priority geologic provinces of the world . The report said about 75% of the resources are in four places : South America and the Caribbean , sub-Saharan Africa , the Middle East and North Africa , and the North American Arctic . In particular , this assessment underscores the importance of continuing to strengthen our energy partnerships in the Western Hemisphere with nations like Brazil.. . said secretary Salazar .\nBloomberg News reported that during her testimony in March 2012 , McNutt told the United States House Committee on Natural Resources that less than 1 percent of wells drilled to dispose of the water after fracking causes induced seismicity . McNutt said more information would reduce the risk of induced earthquakes in a year or two . She said :\nUnited Press International reported in March 2012 that USGS has developed a tool that can map grasslands using remote sensing data from satellites . The technique will help if and when global demand for biofuel products increases as an alternative to fossil fuels . McNutt said in a statement that the study :\nEarthquakes : hazard reduction , drill , research .\nIn cooperation with the Department of Veterans Affairs , USGS continued to monitor and record in detail the performance of veterans hospital buildings during earthquakes . Recently , two buildings were fitted with sensors at the Memphis VA Medical Center which is within the range of the New Madrid Seismic Zone , the most active earthquake zone in the Eastern United States . USGS works with the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program ( NEHRP ) led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) both to monitor buildings during earthquake events and to help design safer hospitals in the future .\nOn October 18 , 2012 , McNutt , Bill Leith of USGS and Michael Mahoney of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) continued earthquake practice at the ShakeOut at the Langston Hughes Middle School in Reston , Virginia . Participants learn to drop , cover , and hold on to protect themselves during an earthquake . Millions of people have participated since the event started in 2008 . Going through drills makes it second nature for the students in the event of an actual emergency , McNutt said of The Great American Shake-Out event held in February 2013 in eight US states that border on the New Madrid Seismic Zone .\nUSGS promised up to US$7 million in grants for earthquake research in 2013 . The agency has funded about 90 such grants which , for example , cataloged southern California earthquakes to better prepare emergency responders , the public and the media . Projects also provided seismic hazard estimates for safer buildings and roads , and provided data on ground shaking to help minimize damage .\nLandsat .\nNASA and USGS launched Landsat 8 on February 11 , 2013 , to continue their 40-year record of providing images for land use and climate change ( about 9 million images as of 2013 ) . McNutt wrote that Landsat 8 enhances USGSs position as land steward for the United States .\nDeparture .\nMcNutt directed USGS from 2009 until 2013 , when she announced her departure to USGS staff members . She said at the time that she would leave after the launch of Landsat 8 and that Suzette Kimball would serve as the acting director .\nExit summary .\nMcNutts announcement included a 21-point summary of her tenure which she prepared for Secretary Salazar . Among achievements listed were realignment of USGS management , eight DOI Climate Science Centers , the first national water census on water use and availability , a California prototype of Earthquake Early Warning , publication of the first two of the biological carbon sequestration reports , and various means of advancing US energy independence .\nScience tenure .\nOpen access : Science Advances .\nAs editor in chief , McNutt led the editorial team at Science in their decision to enter the world of open access publishing . Beginning in 2015 , they expect to publish several thousand articles per year in the online only , open access journal Science Advances ( compared to Science which can publish less than one thousand per year , accepting about 6% of submissions ) . McNutt told Library Journal that they were searching for a solution to licensing , perhaps one license acceptable to all authors or perhaps offering a menu of licenses so each community can choose .\nKeystone XL .\nMcNutt initially sided with environmentalists who opposed approval of the Keystone Pipeline . In an interview for NPRs Morning Edition in 2014 , she explained why she changed her mind and published an editorial in favor . First , the oil is already being transported for example by truck and train , using more fossil fuels than the pipeline would use . Second , she thinks concessions can be made in exchange for approving the pipeline , for example requiring a limit on carbon emissions when converting the tar sands to liquid for transport in the pipeline , and demanding that the pipeline be the safest ever built . Finally , because the pipeline is the very least expensive mode of transport , she found a potential revenue stream in the money saved by the pipeline which she thinks should be used to fund renewable energy in the U.S .\nClimate engineering .\nSeveral U.S . agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency requested that the U.S . government study climate engineering and so the committee that McNutt chairs was born of the National Academy of Sciences . Ken Caldeira , who also sits on the committee , and David Keith are eager to try out ideas , in part spurred by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory funded by Bill Gates who is an enthusiast of climate engineering research . McNutt cautioned that government-sponsored field tests may not happen .\nWhether we wind up using these technologies , or someone else does and we suddenly find ourselves in a geo-engineered world , we have to better understand the impacts and the consequences .\nMeeting with Li Keqiang in China .\nPremier of the Peoples Republic of China , Li Keqiang requested a meeting with McNutt , as editor in chief of Science , to discuss science as part of her trip to China in January 2014 . The meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes and the rules specified no US reporters present and the topics of science and the economy , not politics . They talked on 13 January at Ziguangge , Zhongnanhai in Beijing . Li answered questions from McNutt about space exploration , Chinas scientific cooperation with other developing countries , climate change , education , and environmental protection . Science published a transcript of the 70 minute meeting .\nStatistical review .\nWith a goal to improve the reproducibility of its published research , McNutt announced in 2014 that Science had added statistical checks to its peer-review process . Based on collaboration with the American Statistical Association , the journal appointed seven experts to a Statistics Board of Reviewing who are responsible for securing outside statisticians to review potential Science articles .\nCover photo and controversies .\nThe cover of the 11 July 2014 issue depicted three transgender sex workers from Indonesia with their heads cropped out . Citing she tricked me and the trans panic defense sometimes used by perpetrators , The Washington Post noted that transgender people are 30 percent more likely than others to be the victims of violence . Numerous people objected in their blogs . Congresswoman Jackie Speier objected in a letter to the publisher . Science CEO and publisher Alan Leshner apologized to Speier and termed the cover regrettable . McNutt apologized on Twitter and in Science for any discomfort that this cover may have caused anyone and gave her :\npromise that we will strive to do much better in the future to be sensitive to all groups and not assume that context and intent will speak for themselves .\nThe cover ( and unfortunate response from the former editor of ScienceCareers ) and two other columns provoked Aradhna Tripati , Jennifer Glass , Lenny Teytelman , and 600 other scientists to send a letter in 2015 to Science accusing the journal of perpetuating sexist stereotypes . In one column , Alice S . Huang , the former president of Sciences publisher , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , advised a female postdoctoral fellow not to complain about her supervisor , whose habit was trying to look down the womans shirt , as long as the supervisor didnt develop other advances . In another , the chief biochemist at Torontos University Health Network said he was promoted because his wife had given up her career and PhD to support him . McNutt published a formal apology in July 2015 , and said that she thought Science should start an advisory board made up of young scientists who might be in tune with the issues .\nSupport for science .\nIn June 2014 , the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) together with Nature Publishing Group and Science held a workshop on the reproducibility and rigor of research findings . More than 30 participants , who all publish preclinical biological research , codified a set of principles that will advance and support research that is reproducible , robust , and transparent . The principles are endorsed by 78 associations , journals and societies who all agreed to them .\nin January 2015 , the Pew Research Center published a poll representing the public and a sample of scientists connected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) . The public and scientists disagreed quite dramatically on 12 out of 13 issues covered in the survey . On the occasion of Pews publication , writer Joel Achenbach asked McNutt for her input on a National Geographic feature article , Why Do Many Reasonable People Doubt Science? . McNutt neatly gave this definition :\nScience is not a body of facts . Science is a method for deciding whether what we choose to believe has a basis in the laws of nature or not .\nRetraction .\nIn May 2015 , McNutt and Science retracted a December 2014 study , When contact changes minds : An experiment on transmission of support for gay equality . Donald Green requested the retraction after asking for and not receiving the study data from his coauthor Michael LaCour .\nFamily of journals expands .\nIn 2015 , Science announced the expansion of its family of journals to include Science Robotics and Science Immunology . Both were expected to begin publication in mid-2016 . The first issue of Science Immunology was published in July 2016 , while the first issue of Science Robotics was published in December 2016 .\nNational Academy of Sciences .\nIn July 2015 , McNutt was nominated to stand for election as president of the National Academy of Sciences . She was elected to a six-year term beginning July 1 , 2016 and ending June 30 , 2022 .\nClimate intervention .\nMcNutt chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Geoengineering Climate : Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts , whose sixteen scientists published their findings on climate geoengineering in February 2015 . The committee decided to issue two complementary reports , one on mitigating carbon dioxide emissions , and one on albedo modification . They agreed to call the process intervention , which implies an action intended to improve , rather than management or geoengineering which imply control that people dont have . Of the reports six recommendations , the first is that right now we can and should work toward mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and on adapting to the impacts of climate change .\nThis work was supported by the U.S . intelligence community , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the United States Department of Energy ( DOE ) , and the National Academy of Sciences . At the press briefing on the release of the reports , McNutt expressed preference for the first report over the second : mitigation and adaptation are the way forward ( explaining that albedo modification carries unknown environmental and governance risks ) .\nWorkshop with Pope Francis .\nIn May 2014 , McNutt and a group of international scholars and scientists participated in a workshop with Pope Francis organized by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences . By invitation , McNutt presented a paper , The Risks of Rising Seas to Coastal Populations . In a September editorial in Science , McNutt discussed future habitability and sustainability of this planet and advocated for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which the group wished to adopt . She was a signatory of the workshop report . In advance of the Laudato si papal encyclical of May–June 2015 , the leadership council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network , of which McNutt is a member , released eight criteria for climate change mitigation , which they hoped would be addressed by the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference .\nAwards and honors .\nMcNutt was elected a Foreign member of the Royal Society , and a member of the National Academy of Sciences , the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . She is a fellow for the American Geophysical Union , the Geological Society of America , the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the International Association of Geodesy . She is a past president of the American Geophysical Union ( 2000–2002 ) and current president of the National Academy of Sciences ( 2016-2022 ) .\nShe holds honorary doctorates from Indiana University ( 2021 ) , Boston University ( 2019 ) , Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( 2018 ) , Michigan State University ( 2018 ) , Colorado School of Mines ( 2011 ) Monmouth University ( 2010 ) , the University of Minnesota ( 2004 ) , and Colorado College ( 1989 ) . McNutt was also recognized as an Outstanding Alumni in 2004 by the University of California , San Diego .\nShe chaired the Presidents Panel on Ocean Exploration under President Bill Clinton . McNutt chaired the board of governors of the Joint Oceanographic Institutions which merged to become Consortium for Ocean Leadership for which she was trustee .\nShe serves on evaluation and advisory boards for institutions including the Monterey Bay Aquarium , Stanford University , Harvard University and Science magazine , and the Journal of Science Policy and Governance .\nIn 1988 , McNutt won the Macelwane Medal from the American Geophysical Union , presented for outstanding research by a young scientist , and in 2007 she won the AGUs Maurice Ewing Medal for her contributions to deep-sea exploration and her leadership role in the ocean sciences .\nIn 2002 , Discover magazine named McNutt one of the top fifty women in science . In 2003 she was named Scientist of the Year by the ARCS Foundation .\nThe United States Coast Guard awarded the Meritorious Service Medal to McNutt for her service during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .\nMcNutt is a member of the 2012 USA Science & Engineering Festivals Nifty Fifty , a collection of the most influential scientists and engineers in the United States that are dedicated to reinvigorating the interest of young people in science and engineering .\nMcNutt won the 2017 DRI Nevada Medal .\nIn 2021 , was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering for elucidation of lithosphere geomechanics and leadership in earth resources engineering .",

    "story": "Edgar Prib\nEdgar Prib ( ; born 15 December 1989 ) is a German-Russian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Fortuna Düsseldorf .\nEarly life .\nPrib was born in Neryungri , now Russia , in 1989 into an ethnic German family . The Pribs emigrated to Germany just two years after his birth , settling in Fürth , where he enrolled the SpVgg Greuther Fürth academy .\nClub career .\nGreuther Fürth .\nPrib made it to the Shamrocks′ first team during the 2009–10 2 . Bundesliga season . He missed a major part of the campaign due to torn ankle joint ligament , but he managed to play a total of 11 games anyway . Next season , this number increased to 13 , and in the 2011–12 season he became a regular starter , gaining 27 league appearances and helping his team win the 2 . Bundesliga and promote to the top division for the first time in their history . The first top-flight season was , however , unsuccessful as Greuther Fürth bottomed the 2012–13 Bundesliga table , resulting in relegation . In spite of that , Prib managed to stay in the Bundesliga : during the 2013 summer transfer window he signed with Hannover 96 for an estimated fee of €2.5 million .\nHannover 96 .\nPrib made his debut for the new club on 10 August 2013 , starting the initial game of the season against VfL Wolfsburg at home , the fixture die Rote won 2–0 . He scored twice in his 31 league games that season , also receiving 5 yellow cards . His club finished 10th in the Bundesliga . Next year , he scored against Schalke 04 helping his team win their very first match of the 2014–15 Bundesliga season , this was , however , his only goal in that competition as he injured his meniscus shortly after , reducing his number of league appearances to 20 but helping Hannover avoid relegation . A similar thing happened next season : Prib was ruled out with an injury early in September 2015 , missing nine games in a row . The only difference was that the Reds finished last in the table , relegating to 2 . Bundesliga gaining only 25 points .\nHannover successfully returned to the top flight at the first attempt , promoting directly after finishing second in the 2016–17 2 . Bundesliga . Prib played most of his teams games scoring once against his former club , Greuther Fürth . He also received a total of 10 bookings in that campaign .\nOn 9 August 2017 , Prib was appointed the club captain . He only played once in the 2017–18 season , spending 90 minutes in the German Cup 1st Round away fixture against Bonner SC , a game that Hannover won 6–2 . Shortly after he was diagnosed with cruciate ligament rupture , an injury he picked up during the training . Prib was due to return in April , but was injured again and failed to make a single league appearance . On 3 May 2018 , his contract was extended until May 2019 .

    "story": "S.S.C . Bari\nSocietà Sportiva Calcio Bari , commonly referred to as Bari , is an Italian football club founded in 1908 and based in Bari , Apulia .\nIt currently plays in Serie C .\nThe club spent many seasons bouncing between the top two divisions in Italian football , Serie A and Serie B . The club was formerly known as A.S . Bari or F.C . Bari 1908 as well as other names , due to re-foundations . Bari usually play in all-white with red detailing .\nStatistically Bari are the most successful club from the Apulia region , in terms of the all-time Serie A records . They are amongst the elite in Southern Italian football and are ranked 17th in the all-time Serie A records for all of Italy . Notably they won the Mitropa Cup in 1990 . Bari also held the British football transfer record , when it paid £5,500,000 for David Platt in 1991 . It was the most expensive fee paid by a foreign club for a British player for four years .\nOne of the most notable achievements in the clubs history was in the 1996 season , when their forward Igor Protti became the top scorer in the Serie A with 24 goals . The club are known in the wider footballing world for producing Antonio Cassano who was born in Bari , he shone at the club as a youngster .\nHistory .\nThe foundation .\nFoot-Ball Club Bari was founded in the city on 15 January 1908 . Like the majority of early Italian football clubs , foreign people were involved in the foundation of the club . Amongst the main founders were German Floriano Ludwig , Swiss Gustavo Kuhn and a native trader of Bari called Giovanni Tiberini .\nThe first players included many non-Italians , the FBC Bari originals included ; founder Ludwig , along with Barther ( English ) , Bach ( Swiss ) , Attoma , Roth ( Swiss ) , Labourdette ( Spanish ) , Jovinet ( French ) , Giordano , Gazagne ( French ) , Randi and Ziegler . Originally the club wore red shirts with white shorts , early on they would play against English sailors at the San Lorenzo field in the San Pasquale area of Bari .\nAlthough the club was founded early on , clubs from the Mezzogiorno were not very well represented in the early Italian football championships and thus Bari did not take part in the early seasons . In fact only Campania had a regional section in the league from that area prior to the First World War . The war would see the original club becoming defunct , before being reorganised in 1924 under the same name .\nBy this time other clubs from the city had begun playing too , including Foot-Ball Club Liberty who originally wore blue and white stripes , they were founded as a dissident club from the original Bari in 1909 and their rivals Unione Sportiva Ideale who wore green and black stripes and was founded in 1908 . It was FBC Liberty who became the first ever side from the Province of Bari to take part in the Italian Football Championship , this was during the 1921–22 CCI season , when the main clubs in the country had a falling out with FIGC .\nThe following season Ideale became the first side from Bari to progress to the Southern Italian semi-finals round , but lost out to Lazio . All three clubs featured in the championship for the first time in 1924–25 however FBC Bari were relegated and ceased to exist again in 1927 , Liberty on the other hand reached the Southern semi-finals before losing out heavily to Alba Roma .\nUnione Sportiva Bari .\nDuring the 1926-1928 period the whole of Italian football was changing and beginning to become more organised , and several mergers were taking place in Naples , Florence and Rome around the same time . FBC Liberty opted to change their name into Bari FC and first used it on 6 February 1927 in a match against Audace Taranto , then on 27 February 1928 Bari FC merged with US Ideale to create Unione Sportiva Bari . The original US Bari shirts incorporated the stripes of Ideale , with the red and white colours of FBC Bari .\nAfter the Italian Championship of 1928–29 , the league system was reorganised and Bari was placed in Serie B . One of their players was called up to the Italian national football team that season for the first time , in the form of Raffaele Costantino , this made Bari the first Serie B club to contribute a player and a scorer to the national side .\nBetween Serie A and Serie B .\nThe 1930s and 1940s were Baris golden age , spending much of that time in Serie A with a finish of seventh in 1947 being the best they achieved .\nIn the 1950s Bari went into a sharp decline and an equally rapid revival towards the end of the decade to spend three more years in Serie A ( 1958–61 ) . Stars of the team in this period included Biagio Catalano and Raúl Conti . The club returned to Serie A twice more in this period ( 1963–64 and 1969–70 ) with the latter proving especially harrowing with only 11 goals scored , the lowest of any top-flight club . In 1974 Bari descended to Serie C , finishing that season with only 12 goals scored and 26 conceded in 38 games .\nBy the late 1970s Bari were back in Serie B and on something of an upward swing , narrowly missing promotion in 1982 . They managed promotion to Serie A in 1985 and acquired English players Gordon Cowans and Paul Rideout , but they were unable to prevent an instant return to Serie B .\nA return to Serie A in 1989 with stars including stalwart defender Giovanni Loseto , midfielder Pietro Maiellaro and Brazilian striker João Paulo saw a respectable 10th-place finish in 1990 , their last season at the Della Vittoria . The following season saw Bari move to the San Nicola stadium , built for the 1990 World Cup , but by 1992 , despite the signing of David Platt , and they would be relegated once more .\nPromotion in 1994 saw another two-year stay in Serie A with Igor Protti a regular scorer , and another promotion in 1997 saw the emergence of promising youngsters like Nicola Ventola , Gianluca Zambrotta , Antonio Cassano and Diego De Ascentis . This time they managed a four-year stay in Serie A under the guidance of Eugenio Fascetti , despite his uneasy relationship with many sections of the clubs support . The club has since had a generally indifferent spell in Serie B . However , having been near the top of the Serie B table for much of the 2008–09 season they gained promotion to Serie A on 8 May 2009 , under the guidance of Antonio Conte .\nIn November 2009 , a take-over bid was rejected . A Texas-based company JMJ Holdings also gave an intent to take over in August 2009 .\nWith Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Ranocchia as centre-back and Barreto as striker , Bari performed well in the first half of the season . Eventually Bari finished 10th . However , Bari lost €19 million in 2009 financial year , which meant Bari was quiet in the 2010 summer window ( only Almirón and Ghezzal were the new significant signings plus the purchase of Barreto after the expiration of his loan , who broke his leg in mid-season ) and in the January 2011 transfer window , they failed to find a replacement of Bonucci and Ranocchia . The company recovered from negative equity due to TV income increasing as well as the sale of Bonucci ( a profit of €6.45 million ) . Bari had a positive equity of €870,653 on 31 December 2010 and a net income of 14 million in the 2010 calendar year , due to extraordinary income from selling the brand .\nBari were relegated to Serie B after the 2010–11 season finishing 17 points short of 17th placed Lecce . During the season , manager Giampiero Ventura was replaced by Bortolo Mutti in a failed attempt to save the club from relegation . On 4 March 2011 , Bari played its 1,000th game in Serie A .\nThe End of the Matarrese reign .\nOn 13 June 2011 , President Vincenzo Matarrese and the rest of the board of directors resigned after 28 years of controlling the club . Vincenzo Torrente was brought in to manage the side in the summer of 2011 and much of the playing roster was let go due to financial difficulties at the club and replaced by young players . Despite six and seven point penalties in the following two seasons , Bari under Torrente were able to achieve to mid-table Serie B finishes however , disconcertingly , attendances continued to dwindle . In the summer of 2013 , Torrente resigned and was replaced by Carmine Gautieri , who also resigned after two weeks . The top job was then assigned to Roberto Alberti Mazzaferro .\nThe financial position of the club continued to decline and the Mattarese family reduced the amount of money they put into the club . The clubs debt reached €30m in February 2014 . The club was declared bankrupt on 10 March 2014 . The first bankruptcy auction , on 18 April 2014 , was declared deserted due to the lack of a bid that met all of the criterion . The second auction , on 12 May 2014 , also failed to find a successful bidder . The club was in real danger of disappearing .\nF.C . Bari 1908 .\nThe third bankruptcy auction was held on 20 May 2014 with an asking price for the club of just €2m . A consortium F.C . Bari 1908 S.p.A . led by former Serie A referee Gianluca Paparesta successfully acquired the club assets and sports title . A strong spell of form towards the end of the season , where the club lost just two of its last 15 Serie B matches , meant that Bari qualified for the 2013–14 Serie B play-offs . Bari met Crotone in the quarter finals and won 3–0 , setting up a clash against Latina , the side that finished 3rd in the regular season . The first leg of the play-off semifinal was a sell out with over 50,000 people attending the match , an incredible achievement considering the club recorded an attendance of less than 1,000 just a few months earlier . Bari were knocked out due to two draws ( 2–2 and 2–2 ) .\nIn 2014–15 the team ended the season in 10th place . In 2015–16 Bari gained 5th place in the league and subsequent access to the play-off preliminary match against Novara but lost 4–5 after extra time at Stadio San Nicola .\nIn December 2015 , Cosmo Giancaspro acquired 5% shares of Bari . In April 2016 Noordin Ahmad signed a preliminary agreement to acquire 50% shares of the club but the deal collapsed ; In June 2016 Cosmo Giancaspro became the sole director ( ) of the club , after the entire share capital were acquired by an Italian company Kreare Impresa S.r.l . According to La Repubblica , Kreare Impresa was owned by Giancaspro , but both Giancaspro and his company was involved in a money laundering investigation .\nA new beginning from Serie D : SSC Bari .\nOn 16 July 2018 , Bari were excluded by Co.Vi.Soc . from participating in 2018–19 Serie B due to financial reasons . The shareholders also tried to recapitalize the club and appeal the exclusion to Collegio di Garanzia of Italian National Olympic Committee ( CONI ) , however , it was rejected .\nThanks to the Article 52 of N.O.I.F. , it was reported that Aurelio De Laurentiis , the owner of football club Napoli and film company Filmauro , had won the rights to establish a phoenix club of Bari and restart in 2018–19 Serie D . He also re-established the current Napoli in 2004 . The new club will be named S.S.C . Bari , with De Laurentiis stating his intention to bring it back to Serie A as fast as possible . The club was subsequently assigned to Group I of 2018–19 Serie D , traditionally destined to teams from Sicily and Calabria .\nOn 23 August 2018 , as part of a press conference , Aurelio De Laurentiis announced his eldest son , film producer Luigi De Laurentiis Jr. , as the new Bari chairman .\nBari was promoted to Serie C at the end of the 2018–19 season .\nPlayers .\nAs of 29 January 2021 .\nPresidential history .\nThe official presidential history of Bari , since 1929 until the present day .\n- Alfredo Atti ( 1929–31 )\n- Liborio Mincuzzi ( 1931–32 )\n- Sebastiano Roca ( 1932–33 )\n- Raffaele Tramonte ( 1933–34 )\n- Giovanni Tomasicchio ( 1934–35 )\n- Giovanni Di Cagno Abbrescia ( 1935–36 )\n- Vincenzo Signorile ( 1936–37 )\n- Giuseppe Abbruzzese ( 1937–38 )\n- Giambattista Patarino ( 1938–39 )\n- Angelo Albanese ( 1939–40 )\n- Pasquale Ranieri ( 1940–41 )\n- Giuseppe Santoro ( 1941–42 )\n- Antonio De Palma ( 1941–44 )\n- Andrea Somma ( 1942–43 )\n- Tommaso Annoscia ( 1944–50 )\n- Rocco Scafi ( 1950–51 )\n- Florenzo Brattelli ( 1951–52 )\n- Francesco Saverio Lonero ( 1952–53 )\n- Achille Tarsia Incuria ( 1953–56 )\n- Gianfranco Brunetti ( 1956–59 )\n- Vincenzo La Gioia ( 1959–61 )\n- Angelo Marino ( 1961–63 )\n- Angelo De Palo ( 1961–77 )\n- Antonio Matarrese ( 1977–83 )\n- Vincenzo Matarrese ( 1983–11 )\n- Claudio Garzelli ( 2011–12 ) ( as chief executive )\n- Francesco Vinella ( 2012–14 ) ( as chief executive )\n- Gianluca Paparesta ( 2014–16 )\n- Cosmo Giancaspro ( 2016–18 )\n- Luigi De Laurentiis ( 2018– )\nManagerial history .\nBari have had many managers and trainers , some seasons they have had co-managers running the team , here is a chronological list of them from 1928 onwards :\nHonours .\n- Serie B : 4\n- Champions : 1941–42 , 2008–09\n- Runners-up : 1930–31 , 1933–34 ( without promotion ) , 1957–58 , 1962–63 , 1988–89 , 1993–94\n- Other Promotions : 1927–28 , 1934–35 , 1968–69 , 1984–85 , 1996–97\n- Serie C\n- Champions : 1954–55\n- Scudetto IV Serie\n- Champions : 1953–54\nMitropa Cup : 1\n- Winners : 1990",

The Catalan Parliament passed legislation on 6 September 2017 authorising the referendum which would be binding and based on a simple majority without a minimum threshold . The following day Constitutional Court of Spain suspended the legislation , blocking the referendum . The Spanish government put into effect Operation Anubis in order to disrupt the organisation of the referendum and arrested Catalan government officials . Despite this the referendum went ahead though it was boycotted by unionists and turnout was only 43% . 92% of those who voted supported independence . Around 900 people were injured as the Spanish police used violence to try to prevent voting in the referendum .\nOn 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament declared independence in a vote boycotted by opposition MPs . Almost immediately the Senate of Spain invoked article 155 of the constitution , dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government and imposing direct rule on Catalonia . The following day Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for fresh regional elections on 21 December 2017 .\nOn 30 October 2017 Spanish Attorney General José Manuel Maza laid charges of rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds at the Supreme Court against Nuet and five other members of the Board of the Parliament of Catalonia ( Ramona Barrufet , Lluís Corominas , Carme Forcadell , Lluís Guinó and Anna Simó ) .

Nuet was charged with disobeying an order of the Constitutional Court ( article 410 of the criminal code ) .\nA pre-trial hearing commenced on 18 December 2018 at the Supreme Court at which defence lawyers argued that the court was not competent to hear charges of rebellion or disobedience and that it should be heard at the High Court of Justice of Catalonia . On 27 December 2018 the Supreme Court ruled that , although they were competent to hear all the charges , the six defendants charged only with disobedience ( Barrufet , Mireia Boya , Corominas , Guinó , Nuet and Simó ) would be tried at the High Court of Justice of Catalonia .\nSobiranistes .\nNuet was re-elected at the 2017 regional election .

    "story": "Servant of the People ( political party )\nServant of the People ( ) is a centrist political party in Ukraine .\nIt was formed in late 2017 and was officially registered on 31 March 2018 on the basis of the previously registered party of Decisive Changes . The party is named after the Ukrainian hit TV series Servant of the People . In the 2019 parliamentary election the party won 124 seats on the nationwide party list and 130 constituency seats . The current president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is a member of the party .\nHistory .\nFounding .\nLegally , the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change ( ) that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga .\nThe party was renamed in December 2017 after the eponymous Ukrainian hit TV series Servant of the People that starred Volodymyr Zelensky and was made by his TV production company Kvartal 95 . The rebranded/renamed partys first leader was the CEO of Kvartal 95 Ivan Bakanov . At the time Kvartal 95 created the party , they claimed it was important to do so to prevent others from stealing the name of the eponymous series for cynical political purposes . According to Zelensky in the summer of 2017 some rogues had almost registered a party called Servant of the People and that because of this Kvartal 95 had registered their Servant of the People party so voters would not be mislead to think they would vote for a party that was not related to the TV series of the same name . Early 2018 Zelensky stated that the party was not yet a political project , and said about its future : Lets see .\nIn December 2017 4% of Ukrainians polled by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center declared their readiness to vote for a party named Servant of the People in parliamentary elections , and in May 2018 this number had grown to 5% ( the minimum necessary to pass Ukraines election threshold ) . When democracy watchdog Chesno tried to contact Zelensky and party representatives in September 2018 in an attempt to ask if the party would take part in elections a spokeswoman for Kvartal 95 responded Unfortunately , party representatives are unable to comment on your request . There is currently no information that might be of interest to you . The press service of Kvartal 95 could ( also ) not provide Chesno a picture of party leader Bakanov . Chesno was able to find out that the leadership of the party only consisted of people related to Kvartal-95 .\nBillboards advertising Servants of the People appeared on the streets of Ukrainian cities in November 2018 . Zelensky later admitted that these billboards were legally only advertising the third season of the TV series Servant of the People but were also part of his election campaign so his campaign could save a lot of money . The partys first financiers were either NGOs that did not have to report the origins of their donations or companies that all changed their addresses in the same week , this led Chesno to believe these companies were interconnected . Almost all of the 2018 funds were received on the eve of Zelenskys 2019 New Years speech in which he announced his candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election .\nParty winning the 2019 presidential and parliamentary election .\nIn late December 2018 Zelensky was declared a presidential candidate from the party at the 2019 presidential election . While lagging behind in January 2019 , Zelensky began to lead the polls by March . He would go on to win the first round of the presidential elections , taking first place and moving on to the run off against incumbent President Poroshenko on 21 April 2019 , winning the election with over 73% of the votes cast . Zelensky stated that the party would not enter a coalition government with the Petro Poroshenko Bloc , nor with Opposition Platform — For Life .\nIn his inauguration speech to parliament on 21 May 2019 President Zelensky dissolved parliament and decreed an early election to be held on 21 July 2019 . On 27 May 2019 Dmytro Razumkov was appointed as party chairman in place of Ivan Bakanov . Oleksandr Kornienko had been made head of the partys election headquarters , and Mykhailo Fedorov was installed as the partys chief of digital strategies.<ref Presidents Party Names New Head , Will Interview Candidates For July Elections , Radio Free Europe ( 27 May 2019 ) </ref> On 2 June 2019 , the registration of potential candidates to run for the party in majority constituencies during the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election ended . Party leader Razumkov assured on 7 June 2019 that no incumbent MPs would be on the party list for the 2019 parliamentary election , but that the election list would consist of new ambitious politicians .\nThe party held its first congress on 9 June 2019 . It took place in Kyivs Hryshko National Botanical Garden and was attended by President Zelensky and party leader Razumkov , among others . During the congress the first names of the partys majority constituency candidates and the 97 candidates of the nationwide closed party list were made public . Well-known names in the nationwide party list were : Olympic athletes Olha Saladukha , Vadym Gutzeit and Zhan Beleniuk and long-term CEO of 1+1 Media Group Oleksandr Tkachenko . Three days later Gutzeit and two other candidates had withdrawn themselves from the election , whilst a fourth was excluded from the list after additional checks . During the post-primaries , press and activists highlighted the most controversial representatives of the party , such as Oleksandr Dubinsky and Max Buzhanskiy . Both of them were not withdrawn from the final list of the party after the registration deadlines . The party excluded seven candidates from its list on 7 July 2019 ; five candidates were removed “as a result of information submitted [ to the party ] via the website and chat bot” , whilst two others requested to be removed from the list , including the No . 31 candidate . On 19 July 2019 , the leader of the Movement of New Forces party Mikheil Saakashvili called on his supporters to vote for the Servant of the People party at the parliamentary election .\nIn the ( 21 July ) 2019 parliamentary election the he top ten party candidates were Dmytro Razumkov , Ruslan Stefanchuk , Iryna Venediktova , Davyd Arakhamia , Halyna Yanchenko , Mykhailo Fedorov , Oleksandr Kornienko , Anastasia Krasnosilska , Oleksandr Tkachenko and Zhan Beleniuk . In the election the party won 124 seats on the nationwide party list ( 43.16% of the votes ) and 130 constituency seats . Several members of the political party UKROP ( a party that has openly been supported by Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi ) won constituency seats as candidates for Servant of the People ( the two parties had no formal allegiance ) . In parliament Davyd Arakhamia became the partys faction leader .\nParty since winning the 2019 parliamentary election .\nOn 11 November 2019 Oleksandr Kornienko replaced Razumkov as party chairman .\nThe party won about 25% of the votes in December 2019 local United territorial community elections ( non-aligned candidates gained 44% of the votes ) .\nIn June 2020 the party started to create its local organisation by appointing Cell leaders . In May 2020 the party had no official registered local branch .\nIn the 2020 Ukrainian local elections the party won more seats then the other parties participating , 17.59% of local seats were won by the party . Observers pointed out that the party ( as other national parties ) did suffer setbacks in Ukraines largest cities across the country , including the capital Kyiv . In Kyiv the party mayoral candidate Iryna Vereshchuk and the party itself finished in fifth place . While Servant of the People had been in the 2019 parliamentary election the most popular party among Kyivites with 36.46% . 225 Servant of the People candidates ( 30.74% of all elected mayors nominated by a political party ) were elected village , town or city mayors . Independent candidates won 661 mayoral elections . Although the party had not allowed incumbent MPs but only new ambitious politicians to be their candidate in the 2019 parliamentary election , in the 2020 Ukrainian local elections Servant of the People candidates were incumbent mayors and local council members and ( other ) former members of Party of Regions , Batkivshchyna , Petro Poroshenko Bloc and other political parties . In the elections held in places with a population of less than 10,000 voters the party won 2 seats .\nIdeology and positions .\nOn 23 May 2019 , Ruslan Stefanchuk , Zelenskys representative in the Verkhovna Rada , announced that the party had chosen libertarianism as its core ideology . On 3 June 2019 , however , the head of the partys election office Oleksandr Kornienko claimed , go 20km or 100km out of Kyiv , and nobody will understand the issue of ideology there , who is right , left or centre here . The party will have its manifesto on its website , it will explain everything . After Kornienko was elected as head the party in early November 2019 , he stated that the then party ideology of libertarianism would be changed , which was needed to find a compromise within the party . He claimed that the new party ideology will be something between liberal and socialist views . At the February 2020 Party Congress , Kornienko stated that the partys ideology is Ukrainian centrism . According to him , this is an ideology that denies political extremes and radicalism . But it is creative centrism .\nIn the election program for the 2019 parliamentary election , the party stated , we will introduce the most favored regime for foreign investors of Ukrainian origin . It also promised to introduce a mechanism for withdrawing deputies who have lost the confidence of the voters . The program also puts forward a number of direct democracy and anti-corruption proposals . The party has also vowed to expand Ukraines cooperation with the European Union and NATO . The party also claimed that its key goal is to achieve a higher than average European income and quality of life for Ukrainians .\nIn early July 2019 , Ruslan Stefanchuk , number 2 in the partys election list , expressed his belief that Ukrainian language should be promoted ( in a process of the so-called Ukrainization ) but only quite mildly and that one needs to fight for the language to provide quality . Neither by bans , nor by persecution , but only by equality . When Ukrainian language content becomes more interesting and higher quality , then we will absolutely have another attitude . Meanwhile , the state should work out all mechanisms for that , he said .\nCritics .\nIn March 2019 Ukrainian writer and intellectual Yuriy Andrukhovych believed that Volodymyr Zelenskys team was a light version of the Party of Regions .\nIn December 2018 political commentator Mykhailo Basarab wrote on Den that Zelensky would bring the most trouble to pro-Russian politicians and populists , because he is their closest competitor and will attract part of the pro-Russian and demagogic voters .\nExternal links .\n- Official website\n- Taras Klochko .

    "story": "Salome Zourabichvili\nSalome Zourabichvili ( , ; born 18 March 1952 ) is a French–Georgian politician and former diplomat who currently serves as the fifth President of Georgia , in office since December 2018 . She is the first woman to be elected as Georgias president , a position she will occupy for a term of six years . As a result of constitutional changes coming into effect in 2024 , Zourabichvili is expected to be Georgias last popularly elected president ; all future heads of state are to be elected indirectly by a parliamentary college of electors .\nZourabichvili was born in Paris into a family of Georgian immigrants . She joined the French diplomatic service in the 1970s and went on to occupy a variety of senior diplomatic positions for three decades . From 2003 to 2004 , she served as the Ambassador of France to Georgia . In 2004 , by mutual agreement between France and Georgia , she accepted Georgian nationality and became the Foreign Minister of Georgia . During her tenure at the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MFA ) , she negotiated a treaty that led to the withdrawal of Russian forces from the undisputed parts of the Georgian mainland . She has also served at the UN Security Council’s Iran Sanctions Committee as the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts .\nAfter a falling out with Georgias then President Mikheil Saakashvili , in 2006 Zourabichvili founded The Way of Georgia political party , which she led until 2010 . Ultimately , she was elected to the Georgian Parliament in 2016 as an independent ; she vacated her parliamentary seat after being sworn in as President . During the 2018 Georgian presidential election , Zourabichvili ran as an independent candidate and was supported by the governing Georgian Dream party . She prevailed in a run-off vote against Grigol Vashadze .\nEarly life and education .\nZourabichvili was born in Paris into a family of Georgian political emigrants . Her father , Levan ( 1906–1975 ) , was an engineer and served as a chairman of the Georgian Diaspora in Paris . He was the grandson of Niko Nikoladze , a prominent Georgian social democrat from the late nineteenth century , scion of noble Nikoladze family and a member of meore dasi , a collection of Georgian liberal intelligentsia . Her mother , Zeinab Kedia ( 1921–2016 ) , was related by marriage to Noe Ramishvili , the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Georgia . Zourabichvili has one brother , Otar . She attended some of the most prestigious French schools , such as Institut dÉtudes Politiques de Paris ( Sciences Po ) , and began a masters program at Columbia University in New York in the academic year of 1972–1973 , taking courses with Zbigniew Brzezinski . Zourabichvili is a cousin of Hélène Carrère dEncausse , a distinguished Franco-Georgian historian who serves as the head of the Académie française .\nCareer .\nCareer in diplomacy .\nZourabichvili abandoned her studies and joined the French foreign service in 1974 , becoming a career diplomat with postings to Rome , the United Nations , Brussels , Washington , etc . The first time Zourabichvili visited Georgia was in 1986 during a break from her job at the French Embassy in Washington .\nSalomé Zourabichvili was Head of the Division of International and Strategic Issues of National Defence General Secretariat of France in 2001–2003 . She was appointed the Ambassador of France to Georgia in 2003 .\nMinister of Foreign Affairs , 2004–2005 .\nPresident Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia nominated her as Minister of Foreign Affairs in his new government . Zourabichvili became the first woman to be appointed to this post in Georgia on 18 March 2004 .\nZourabichvili was the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts assisting the UN Security Council’s Iran Sanctions Committee .\nAs foreign minister of Georgia , Zourabichvili was the main negotiator of the agreement for the withdrawal of Russian military bases from the territory of Georgia , which was signed with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov on 19 May 2005 . During her tenure as Foreign Minister , the New Group of Friends of Georgia was created , bringing together Ukraine , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , Romania , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic and Poland to help Georgias aspirations towards NATO and foster European integration .\nZourabichvili was sacked by Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli late on 19 October 2005 after a series of disputes with members of Parliament . She had also been heavily criticized by a number of Georgian ambassadors . Shortly before her dismissal was announced , Zourabichvili resigned from the French foreign service , which had continued to pay her a salary while she was minister , and announced that she would remain in Georgia to go into politics .\nPolitical career .\nIn November 2005 , Zourabichvili set up the organization Salomé Zourabichvili’s Movement . In January 2006 she announced the establishment of a new political party Georgias Way , criticizing the countrys de facto one-party system . Although Zourabichvili enjoyed some degree of reputation in Georgia she was long unable to establish herself in the political field . At the city council elections in Tbilisi on 5 October 2006 , only 2.77% of the constituency voted for her party . Six months before , an opinion poll conducted by the Georgian weekly Kviris Palitra suggested that she would garner 23.1% of the votes at presidential elections . Since October 2007 , her party was part of the United Opposition alliance which nominated Zourabichvili as a Prospective Prime Minister in case of their candidate Levan Gachechiladzes victory in the January 2008 presidential election .\nAs part of a 2009 campaign of the Georgian opposition to force President Mikheil Saakashvili to resign , Zourabichvili led a protest march together with three other prominent opposition figures – Nino Burjanadze , David Gamkrelidze and Eka Beselia – in Tbilisi on 26 March 2009 .\nOn 12 November 2010 , Zourabichvili announced her withdrawal from the leadership of Georgias Way . She was succeeded by Kakha Seturidze . After a two-year leave from politics , she publicly endorsed Georgian Dream ahead of the 2013 presidential elections . Shortly after , Georgias Central Election Commission refused to register her as a presidential candidate due to her dual Georgian-French citizenship .\nIn the 8 October 2016 parliamentary elections Zourabichvili won a seat as an independent , representing the Mtatsminda district of Tbilisi . She became MP on 18 November . During her term as MP , She was Deputy chairwoman of parliamentary committee on Diaspora and Caucasus Issues .\nPresidency .\nIn August 2018 , Zourabichvili announced that she would participate in Georgian presidential elections . While she was officially independent , her campaign was heavily supported by Georgian Dream . Her main opponent in the election , Grigol Vashadze , was backed by Mikheil Saakashvili . The pre-election campaign was marred by a highly polarized political environment . International observers assessed the elections as competitive and free , stressing that one side enjoyed an undue advantage and the negative character of the campaign on both sides undermined the process , while the misuse of administrative resources blurred the line between party and state .\nIn the first round , final results showed Zourabichvili with just 38.7 percent of the vote , one percentage point ahead of Vashadze , forcing a run-off . Zourabichvili won the 2nd round of the 2018 Georgian presidential election , becoming President-elect . She was inaugurated as President of Georgia on 16 December 2018 , with the ceremony performed in Telavi .\nAs President , Zourabichvili inherited a new Constitution that entered into force the day of her inauguration and which significantly removed several powers from the Presidency , concentrating them within Parliament and the Prime Ministers Office . However , this did not stop her from using her position to call for historically-important decisions , including a new investigation into the controversial death of Zviad Gamsakhurdia , the countrys first President , in 1993 .\nResidence and funding .\nSalomé Zourabichvili announced during the presidential campaign that if elected , she would not work from the Avlabari Presidential Palace opened in 2009 , with Mikheil Saakashvili in office . She met with the fourth President after elections in the Avlabari Palace , but her administration has been moved into the Orbeliani Palace on Atoneli street in Central Tbilisi . On December 18 , 2018 she visited the Atoneli residence for the first time . Media met her at the entrance , emphasising the fact that she walked to the office .\nBesides moving to the smaller residence , Zourabichvilis office faced a significant budgetary cutback . According to the 2019 budget , funding for the presidential administration is being reduced by just over ₾ 3.5 million . As a result , the vast majority of former employees were fired with only 60 of them remaining in administration .\nChanges have also led to abolishing the presidential fund which amounted ₾5 million and funded scholarships , educational programs and various other projects . This decision has been widely criticized with Giorgi Margvelashvili and Maka Chichua campaigning for it to remain .\nPolitical positions .\nWomens rights and equality .\nAs the first popularly elected woman president of Georgia , Zourabichvili has advocated for womens rights and equality through social media and from political tribunes . She has organised a number of meetings and attended conferences aiming for the empowerment of women and young girls . On October 5th 2019 , she hosted a meeting of women leaders from Georgia , Belgium and France , later saying on Twitter : The role of women in our society is crucial and their contribution to our political , cultural , entrepreneurial and educational circles is key to our development .\nLGBTQ rights .\nAmid the controversy around the 2019 Tbilisi Pride Parade , Zourabichvili said : “I am everyone’s president , regardless of sexual orientation or religious affiliation . No human should be discriminated against . I must also emphasize that our country is dealing with enough controversies and doesn’t need any further provocation from any side of the LGBTQ debate . This comment was met with criticism by LGBTQ organizations across the country , as well as some members of the civil society . Tbilisi Pride co-founder Tamaz Sozashvili wrote : How can she consider peaceful citizens and aggressive fundamentalists as equal sides ? She made no response to the criticism .\nMonarchy .\nIn course of the 2008 Georgian presidential election , Zourabichvili and many other opposition politicians voiced support for the establishment of a constitutional monarchy under the Bagrationi dynasty , which the Patriarch of Georgia , Ilia II , had advocated .\nPersonal life .\nSalomé Zourabichvili was married to the Georgian journalist Janri Kashia ( 1939–2012 ) . She has two children , Kethevane and Teimuraz , from her first marriage to Iranian-American economist Nicolas Gorjestani . Zourabichvili is the cousin of French historian Hélène Carrère dEncausse . Besides Georgian and French , she is also fluent in English , and is conversational in German and Italian .\nWorks .\n- Salomé Zourabichvili ( 2006 ) . Une femme pour deux pays .

    "story": "Scott Brown ( politician )\nScott Philip Brown ( born September 12 , 1959 ) is an American diplomat , attorney , and politician who served as the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa . He is a former United States Senator for Massachusetts ( 2010–2013 ) , and also was the 2014 Republican nominee for the U.S . Senate in New Hampshire . Prior to his Senate tenure , Brown served as a member of the Massachusetts General Court , first in the State House of Representatives ( 1998–2004 ) and then in the State Senate ( 2004–2010 ) .\nIn 2010 , Brown faced Democratic candidate Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in a special election which occurred after the 2009 death of longtime Senator Ted Kennedy . While initially trailing Coakley by a large margin , Brown saw a sudden late surge and posted a come-from-behind win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S . Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972 . Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012 , but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren . He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company , joined Fox News as a commentator , and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services .\nAfter re-establishing residence in New Hampshire , Brown then campaigned for the U.S . Senate from New Hampshire in the 2014 elections . Brown won the Republican nomination by a significant margin , but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen in the general election .\nOn April 20 , 2017 , it was reported that Brown had been nominated by President Donald Trump to be the next United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa . He was confirmed by the Senate as Ambassador to New Zealand on June 8 , 2017 and arrived in New Zealand on June 25 . In December 2020 , Brown became dean of New England Law Boston , a private law school located in downtown Boston .\nEarly life and education ( 1959–1978 ) .\nBrown is of English ancestry , from a family that has been in New Hampshire since the colonial era . His earliest American ancestor was 17th century immigrant Francis Matthews , who sailed from Devonshire , England . Brown is part of a 9th generation New Hampshire family and was born on September 12 , 1959 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard located on Seaveys Island in Kittery , Maine . Browns father , Claude Bruce Brown , and mother , Judith Ann Judi ( née Rugg ) , divorced when he was about a year old . When he was a young child , his mother moved with him to Wakefield , Massachusetts . He often spent his summers in Newburyport , Massachusetts , where his father served as a city councilor for 18 years . He also spent summers in Portsmouth , New Hampshire during his youth . His father and his grandfather were Republicans . His father has said that young Scott became interested in running for political office in the mid-1960s while accompanying him on a campaign for state office .\nBrown had a difficult childhood ; after her divorce , his working mother received welfare benefits . Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone – which he did not disclose , even to his family , until his autobiography Against All Odds ( 2011 ) – and physical abuse from his stepfathers . During various periods of his childhood , Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt . He shoplifted many times , and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem , Massachusetts at the age of 13 or 14 . Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay on that question as his punishment . Brown later said , that was the last time I ever stole .\nHe graduated from Wakefield High School in 1977 . He received a Bachelor of Arts in History , cum laude from Tufts University in 1981 and a Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School in 1985 . During his undergraduate career at Tufts , Brown was a member of the Kappa chapter of Zeta Psi International Fraternity .\nEarly career ( 1978–1992 ) .\nArmy National Guard service .\nBrown has said the rescue efforts of Army National Guard during the Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978 impressed him . When he was 19 , he joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard , received his basic training at Fort Dix , New Jersey , and attended Reserve Officers Training Corps ( ROTC ) classes at the campus of Northeastern University . He was trained in infantry , quartermaster , and airborne duties , and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate Generals Corps ( JAG ) . He was active in the Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel . As the Army National Guards head defense attorney in New England , Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive drug tests , and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to war zones . He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in Kazakhstan and a week in Paraguay .\nHe was awarded the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service in preparing for troops mobilization for Operation Noble Eagle ( the mobilization of National Guard and U.S . Army Reserve personnel to provide security on military installations , airports , and other potential homeland targets ) shortly after the September 11 , 2001 attacks , and later for mobilization support for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom of the Iraq War . He credits his military experience with causing him to focus on veterans issues as well as issues of war and peace . He has served on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs , the Hidden Wounds of War Commission , and the Governors Task Force on Returning Veterans during his career as a legislator .\nOn May 2 , 2011 , Brown announced that he would soon go to Afghanistan for training as part of his Army National Guard service . When deployed in August 2011 for a week of training , he spent most of his time in Kabul .\nOn August 1 , 2012 , Brown was promoted to Colonel in a private ceremony presided over by fellow senator John McCain . He officially retired from the Army on May 13 , 2014 after 35 years of service , and was awarded the Legion of Merit .\nModeling .\nIn June 1982 , Brown , then a 22-year-old law student at Boston College , won Cosmopolitan magazines Americas Sexiest Man contest . After two weeks on a crash diet of three cans of tuna a day and intensive workouts he was featured in the magazines centerfold , posing nude but strategically positioned so that according to Brown , You dont see anything . In the accompanying interview , he referred to himself as a bit of a patriot and stated that he had political ambitions . The Cosmopolitan appearance and its $1,000 fee helped pay for law school , and began for Brown a long , lucrative part-time catalog and print modeling career in New York and Boston during the 1980s . Brown took a leave of absence from Boston College and further pursued his modeling career in New York where he was represented by Wilhelmina Models while taking classes at the Benjamin N . Cardozo School of Law . He returned to Boston , after nearly two years , to continue his studies at Boston College and continued to work as a model represented by Boston agent , Maggie Trichon of Maggie Inc .\nState political career ( 1992–2010 ) .\nBrown caught the political bug in 1992 when he was elected property assessor of Wrentham , Massachusetts . In 1995 , he was elected to the Wrentham Board of Selectmen .\nHe successfully ran for the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1998 , representing the 9th Norfolk District for three terms . Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat Cheryl Jacques . Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004 , and again in November 2006 , running without opposition the second time . He won re-election in November 2008 , defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59–41 percent margin . Following his re-election , Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat Massachusetts Senate . In the Massachusetts Senate , Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection , professional licensing , education , election laws , public safety , and veterans affairs .\nIn February 2007 , a controversy arose after Browns appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham , Massachusetts as part of a debate on gay marriage . The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter , Ayla . During his presentation , Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements . Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience .\nIn January 2010 , The Boston Globe reported that during six terms in the Legislature , three each in the House and Senate , Brown had a modest record of legislative initiatives , but he had carved out a niche as a leading advocate for veterans . Richard Tisei of Wakefield , Massachusetts , the leader of the Republican minority in the state Senate , called Brown the acknowledged expert on veterans issues . State Senator Jack Hart , a Democrat of South Boston , said : He does his homework , hes comprehensive in his approach , and on veterans issues , hes one of them and has done a very good job on their behalf .\nBrown lists among his achievements as a legislator his authorship of a 2007 law that created a check-off box on state income tax forms for veterans to indicate whether they served in Iraq or Afghanistan . The state uses the information to notify veterans of available services and benefits , including the Welcome Home Bonus that provides $1,000 for those returning from active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq .\nU.S . Senate ( 2010–2013 ) .\n2010 election .\nOn September 12 , 2009 ( his 50th birthday ) , Brown announced his run for the U.S . Senate seat that became vacant with the death of Ted Kennedy , saying the state needs an independent thinker . Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker said that Browns political positions did not fall neatly into party lines , and called Brown mainstream in a nation that defines itself as mostly conservative . Boris Shor , political scientist at the Harris School of Public Policy , described Brown as a liberal Republican by national standards , but well-suited for his Massachusetts constituency . Shor explained the support Brown was receiving from the conservative national Republican Party as due to their decentralized decision to support the candidate most likely to win .\nBrown won a landslide victory in the Republican primary on December 8 , 2009 , defeating late entrant and perennial candidate Jack E . Robinson by a margin of 89 percent to 11 percent .\nBrowns opponents in the general election were Democratic nominee , Attorney General Martha Coakley , and independent Joseph L . Kennedy ( no relation to the Kennedy family ) . At the outset , he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley , he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state , and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Years season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics . No Republican had been elected to the U.S . Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972 . He polled far behind Coakley for several months , but closed the gap in the early weeks of January .\nOne week before the January special election , a controversy arose over a Coakley approved television ad . The ad referenced the conscientious objector amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients rights . This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care ( the morning-after pill ) to rape victims if they objected due to a religious belief . After the amendment failed , Brown did vote for the main bill which , along with other patient rights , requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care . Coakleys ad featured a male voice that said , Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims , over the ads graphic which had the words , Deny care to rape victims . Browns daughter Ayla called the Coakley ad completely inaccurate and misleading , and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim . Brown criticized Coakley for running what he described as attack ads .\nIn the 2010 Senate race , although Brown was not endorsed by the Greater Boston Tea Party group , the group organized a fund-raising breakfast for him in Boston .

His campaign office stated it raised $5 million over the period from January 11–15 . Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report stated on January 17 that he would put his finger on the scale for Brown as the favorite . The Rothenberg Political Report released a statement that the combination of public and private survey research and anecdotal information now strongly suggests that Republican Scott Brown will defeat Democrat Martha Coakley in tomorrows race . Suffolk Universitys polling of three bellwether counties on January 18 had Brown leading Coakley by double-digit margins . Brown won the January 19 election , performing well in traditional Republican strongholds and holding rival Coakleys margins down in many Democratic precincts .\nOn election night , after Coakley conceded , Brown gave a victory speech that stated , It all started with me , my truck , and a few dedicated volunteers . It ended with Air Force One making an emergency run to Logan . I didnt mind when President Obama came here and criticized me – that happens in campaigns . But when he criticized my truck , thats where I draw the line . Browns upset win stunned the national Democratic party , and foreshadowed nationwide success for Republicans in 2010 .\n2012 election .\nOctober 2011 polling showed Browns approvals had fallen and he faced a competitive re-election if matched against Democrat Elizabeth Warren . However , his numbers in early March 2012 showed he led Warren by 8 points in the polls . In March 2012 , Browns lead had narrowed to 2.3% , within the margin of error . As of September 2012 , several polls showed Warren with a lead over Brown ( with one still giving Brown an edge ) .\nOn November 6 , 2012 , Brown was defeated by Elizabeth Warren in the general election . Warren was able to garner 54% of the vote , while Brown won 46% .\n2014 election .\nAfter much anticipation by the media , Brown announced that he would run for U.S . Senate seat in New Hampshire .

A poll conducted in May by the Republican Governors Association showed Brown leading Jeanne Shaheen by 5 points . In late August , a WMUR/UNH poll showed Shaheen leading Brown by two points , 46 to 44 . Polls were mixed in the final three weeks of the election , with most showing Shaheen ahead by 1–8 percentage points , and weekly polls by NH1 News , New England College , and Vox Populi showing Brown leading by 1–4 points .\nThere were five total debates during the election , three of which were televised .

During this time , 112 other international diplomats used the government run quarantine facilities , which were temporarily housed in New Zealand hotels , to spend 14 days in monitored quarantine , but Browns group of 6 did not .

In a letter to the editor of The Boston Globe written on January 8 , 2012 , Brown wrote , With out-of-control government spending and rising debt and deficits , politicians in Washington have proven time and time again that they cannot manage hard-earned taxpayer money responsibly . So why should we give them even more ?\nBrown opposed a proposed multibillion-dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation . Brown , discussing the proposal through a spokesperson , said that he is opposed to higher taxes , especially in the midst of a severe recession .

However , Browns amendment also required that all hospitals still had to provide a means for the patient to receive the medication , either by providing another healthcare worker willing to administer the medication , or , in the case of religious hospitals , to provide transportation to another facility , and in a timely manner .

Renamed No . 1 Aerodrome Defence Squadron ( 1ADS ) on 25 June 1951 and was disbanded in March 1953 .\nThe unit was again reformed on 1 July 1992 at RAAF Base Tindal , Northern Territory . Initially formed to provide the training under the Ready Reserve Scheme , however , this was amended to the ground defence , protection and security of RAAF installations , assets , facilities and personnel on 30 June 1992 .\nOn 1 January 1999 , No . 1 Airfield Defence Squadron ( 1AFDS ) was relocated to RAAF Base Edinburgh , South Australia . In 1999 , 16 Reserve Airfield Defence Guards from 1AFDS were deployed to East Timor for Operation Warden/Stabilise under the command of No . 2 Airfield Defence Squadron .\nIn 2010 , 1AFDS was moved to Amberley and expanded to full-time service members working with reserve flights .\nOn 4 July 2013 , following a re-organisation of security forces within the RAAF , 1AFDS was re-roled as No . 1 Security Forces Squadron , with the HQ element based RAAF Williamtown . The ADGs were joined by the newly created Air Force Security ( AFSEC ) and Air Force Police ( AFPOL ) elements within New South Wales , the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria .\nOperations .\n- World War II\n- East Timor\n- Iraq War\n- Afghanistan War\n- 2001–present\nStructure .\n- Headquarters\n- Rifle Flights x 5\n- Security Flights x 5",

    "story": "Ruth Kelly\nRuth Maria Kelly ( born 9 May 1968 ) is a former British Labour Party politician , serving as Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Bolton West from 1997 until she stood down in 2010 . Previously , she served as the Secretary of State for Transport , Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government , Minister for Women and Equality and Secretary of State for Education and Skills , serving under both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair .\nBackground .\nKelly was born in Limavady , County Londonderry , Northern Ireland . She also lived briefly in the Republic of Ireland before moving to England where she attended Edgarley Hall , the preparatory school for Millfield School . She was educated at the independent Sutton High School , run by the Girls Day School Trust ( GDST ) . After being moved up a year and sitting O-levels at Sutton High School at the age of 15 , she decided to move back to Ireland to look after her ill grandmother . Her grandmother died after six weeks , but Kelly stayed for a year , living with her aunt and taking A-level French . She returned to England on winning a scholarship to the sixth-form of Westminster School . From Westminster , Kelly went up to The Queens College , Oxford , to read Philosophy , Politics and Economics in 1986 , graduating in 1989 , and then on to the London School of Economics where she was awarded a MSc degree in Economics in 1992 . Kelly taught at University of Navarra , after she joined the Labour Party in 1990 , becoming a member of the partys Bethnal Green and Stepney constituency party . She was an economics writer for The Guardian from 1990 , before becoming deputy head of the Inflation Report Division of the Bank of England in 1994 . She married Derek John Gadd , a local government officer , in 1996 , and they have four children .\nFamily history .\nKellys maternal grandfather , Philip Murphy , served as an officer in the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) during the Irish War of Independence ( 1919–1921 ) . In 1922 he was interned by the Government of Northern Ireland . Murphys detention file refers to him as quartermaster of the West Fermanagh IRA Battalion . He went on hunger strike to protest at his detention . He was released unconditionally in June 1924 , when internment ended . Her paternal grandfather Francis ( Frank ) Kelly joined the Connaught Rangers and served in France during the First World War . After the war , he returned to County Tyrone and took up a post of School Master in Altishane . His first wife died leaving a young family of six . He remarried Mary Agnes and had another six children . One of them James ( Seamus ) was Ruths father .\nReligion .\nKelly is a practising Roman Catholic , a member of the Opus Dei and regular attender at their meetings and events . Her brother , Ronan Kelly , is a supernumerary in the Opus Dei organisation . Previously , uncertainty has existed over Kellys Opus Dei membership , partly because she herself has declined when asked to say whether or not she is a member , saying only that she has received spiritual support from them .\nCareer as an MP .\nIn the 1997 general election , Kelly gained the seat of Bolton West from the Conservatives while heavily pregnant , and gave birth to her first son eleven days later . She gained her place in parliament as Tony Blair became Prime Minister with Labours landslide election victory .\nShe served on the Treasury Select Committee ; she was also appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Agriculture Minister , Nick Brown , from 1998 . Kelly was a member of a commission set up by the Institute for Public Policy Research into the Private Finance Initiative , which expressed some scepticism about the operation of the policy .\nAfter Labour won the 2001 general election , Kelly was appointed as Economic Secretary to the Treasury . Her role focused on competition policy and small businesses . After a year she was promoted to be Financial Secretary to the Treasury , giving her responsibility for regulation of the financial services industry . In both positions her principal task was in the thorough revision of the Financial Services regulation system which was introduced by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 . Kelly brought in new regulations to tackle the funding of terrorism after September 2001 attacks .\nKelly was assigned the task of dealing with Equitable Life after the Penrose Report into the life insurance company was published . She rejected calls for government compensation to Equitable policyholders , on the grounds that the losses arose from actions of the company rather than from any defect of regulation , and that it was still trading . Equitable policyholders continued to demand redress .\nAs a mother of four young children , she refused to work the long hours normally associated with such positions and refused to take a red box in the evening whilst at the Treasury .\nIn a minor reshuffle , she was promoted to be Minister for the Cabinet Office on 9 September 2004 , replacing Douglas Alexander . Kelly guided the Civil Contingencies Bill through its final stages in Parliament , which faced serious objections from some civil liberties campaigns .\nParty loyalty .\nKelly hardly ever voted against the position of her party and in the most divisive votes over Labours term , she followed the party line . She voted for the Iraq War , and subsequently voted against an independent investigation into the run-up to the war . Kelly also voted for the introduction of tuition top-up fees , in a vote that saw a massive rebellion amongst Labour MPs . She also voted for the introduction of identity cards , voted for replacing Trident , and argued against the addition of a sunset clause in part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 . In a free parliamentary vote on 20 May 2008 , Kelly voted for cutting the upper limit for abortions from 24 to 12 weeks , along with two other Catholic cabinet ministers Des Browne and Paul Murphy .\nSecretary of State for Education and Skills .\nIn the reshuffle following the resignation of David Blunkett on 15 December 2004 , Kelly entered the Cabinet ( also becoming a member of the Privy Council ) with the position of Secretary of State for Education and Skills . She became the youngest woman ever to sit in the Cabinet .\nThe Governments Extended Schools policy , which plans to open some schools from 8 a.m . to 6 p.m . and provide child-care services for working parents , has been dubbed by some as Kelly hours after Kelly . although the National Childcare Strategy with before and after school care funded in most schools by the New Opportunities Fund pre-dated extended schools ( and Ruth Kellys ministerial tenure ) by several years . The extended schools initiative is predicated on wider use of and access to schools as community resources , not just for parents and children . Her proposals in the 2005 white paper to reduce the number and influence of parent governors in Trust Schools , were seen as a partial reversal of this earlier stance .\nKelly attracted considerable criticism by rejecting the proposals of the Tomlinson report on education reform for the 14–19 age group , which suggested replacing A-level exams with a four-tier diploma . After the 2005 election , it was rumoured that she was to be demoted back into her old post at the Treasury and although she kept her position at the DfES , she was said to have been less than thrilled by the appointment of Tony Blairs adviser Andrew Adonis as a Minister within her Department .\nSex offenders in schools controversy .\nOn 9 January 2006 , it came to light that Kellys department had granted permission for a man who had been cautioned by police for viewing child pornography images and who was on a sex offenders register to be employed at a school , on the basis that he had not been convicted of an offence . He , and an unknown number of others on the sex offenders register , were not on the DfES prohibited list , List 99 .\nOn 13 January , Kim Howells , a Minister of State at the DfES , admitted that it was he who had actually made the decision , in accordance with advice given to him by civil servants that the person did not represent an ongoing threat to children but that he should be given a grave warning . In response to the critical media coverage surrounding the issue , Downing Street issued a statement confirming their confidence in Kelly and denying rumours that she was to be replaced .\nThere was further controversy when it transpired that another teacher had been cleared to work at a school , despite the fact that he had been convicted in 1980 for indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl and had been previously removed from three schools . A letter from the Department for Education that suggested the Secretary of State had considered his case and found that although his past actions had been unwise and unacceptable , he had undertaken teaching work to good effect since .\nTrust schools .\nA notable controversy in Ruth Kellys time at the DfES was the proposed introduction of Trust schools . The Trusts were intended to be non-profit making and to have charitable status , although they could be formed by commercial enterprises . In fact , one of the early DfES-hosted seminars on the establishment of Trusts included representatives from Microsoft and KPMG . However , it was their ability to set their own admission arrangements that generated the most criticism .\nA large number of Labour backbenchers , as well as numerous party luminaries like Neil Kinnock and former Education Secretary Estelle Morris , made known their opposition to the proposals and published an alternative white paper . Faced with such a rebellion , the government initially stressed that it would press on with the reforms . However , new Tory leader David Cameron unexpectedly announced that these reforms were in line with Tory policies and that he would support the bill if presented in the proposed form . The government were faced with the prospect of pushing through their reforms only with opposition support and in the face of increased resistance from its own supporters .\nWhen the Education and Inspections Bill 2006 was finally published on 28 February 2006 , it contained much of what had been trailed , although most notable by its absence was any mention of trust school . Foundation and Voluntary Aided schools were left to pick up the mantle of trust schools .\nReligion and political views .\nThe effect of her religious viewpoint on her opinions regarding controversial scientific questions has been of concern to some scientists who have speculated that her religious views could have an effect on government policy regarding stem cell research .\nChildrens schooling .\nAll four of Ruth Kellys children started at a Roman Catholic primary school in Wapping , east London . However , on 8 January 2007 , the Daily Mirror revealed that she had withdrawn her son from the voluntary aided school , and — following professional advice — sent him to a preparatory school that specialises in the education of boys aged 7–13 with dyslexia and/or developmental coordination disorder . Though the additional cost for specialist support outside the state sector sometimes is covered by the local authority , Kelly stated she has not and will not seek its help in meeting these costs .\nAccording to Ofsted inspection in 2002 those with special educational needs , make particularly good progress at English Martyrs Roman Catholic school , and that pupils generally meet standards that are much better than those gained by pupils in similar schools . The school achieved the best exam results in the borough of Tower Hamlets and among the best in the UK , with 96% of children reaching the expected standard for English , and 100% for Maths and Science . The areas education authority also runs six special needs schools within reach of Kellys home and responded to the controversy saying , We are proud of the quality of education we offer to all children . We have a strong record in helping children with a wide range of learning needs to succeed .\nIan Gibson , Labour MP for Norwich North , called the decision a slap in the face for the teachers and pupils in the school the child has been taken out of . However , Conservative Party leader David Cameron , whose own disabled son Ivan attended a state special needs school , defended her decision , saying People should recognise that politicians like everyone else are parents first and will act in the best interests of their children .\nKelly made a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about the Mirrors reporting of the story , but the complaint was rejected , with the PCC ruling that the story was a matter of considerable public interest , given that she is a Cabinet minister – who had previously been Secretary of State for Education and Skills , and even if government policy included an acceptance of private schooling for those with special needs , the fact that the complainant did not feel that the current state system could meet her childs requirements raised questions about the nature of funded schooling and its ability to cater for children with special needs – including those whose families would not be able to pay for private schooling .\nFathers for Justice attacks .\nTwice Kelly has been targeted by members of fathers rights group Fathers 4 Justice in egg-throwing incidents . The first was in April 2005 ; protester Simon Wilmot-Coverdale was charged , and in February 2006 Kelly gave evidence at Salford Magistrates Court . As she left the court , she was again attacked , this time by Michael Downe ; the egg smashed on the back of her head . Downes was fined and given an ASBO , which he proceeded to rip up outside the court , promising to continue to fight for fathers rights .\nSecretary of State for Communities and Local Government .\nAfter the English local elections in May 2006 , Ruth Kelly was appointed Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government , a position created when these functions were split off from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister . The Department also took over the Home Offices responsibilities for active communities and civic renewal . She was also given the post of Minister for Women and Equality . Ruth Kellys successor at the Department for Education and Skills was Alan Johnson .\nOn 16 October 2006 , she announced that her new role would involve cutting down on extremists within communities .\nCatholic social views and homosexuality .\nKellys staunchly Catholic beliefs and social positions clashed with her Cabinet position as a member of Tony Blairs government , which was pushing for a number of progressive reforms and equality for gay and bisexual people . Criticism intensified when Kelly later became Minister for Women and Equality , and criticism was aired on BBC Radio 5 Live and the front page of The Independent in 2006 over her stance on homosexuality . Blairs government repealed many laws that were perceived as being anti-gay , but Kelly consistently opted out of voting on her partys measures . Kelly opposed lowering the age of consent for homosexuality , as well as voting against outlawing discrimination against gay couples adopting children . Out of fourteen votes during the Blair government surrounding the political issues of homosexuality , Kelly had only attended two .\nLGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell attacked Kelly for her views on homosexuality , claiming : Tony Blair would never appoint someone to a race equality post who had a lukewarm record of opposing racism . In a letter published in The Times on 11 May 2006 , the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster claimed that attacks on Kelly were anti-Catholic . Cardinal Cormac Murphy-OConnor wrote Ms Kelly may well be scrutinised for her fitness in office . That is a political judgement . But her Catholicism should not be a criterion in forming that judgement .\nThe Observer newspaper reported on 15 October 2006 that Kelly had joined the Prime Minister in seeking to exempt churches from new equality laws which would require Christian churches to treat homosexuality with equal validity to heterosexuality , which Kelly felt went against Catholic teaching . Lorely Burt , the Liberal Democrat Equalities spokesperson , who opposed allowing churches to preach against homosexuality in schools , called for Kelly to be removed from the Cabinet . It was reported in January 2007 that Kelly supported an exemption for Catholic adoption agencies from new laws that would allow them to refuse service to gay couples .\nPlanning decisions .\nRuth Kelly demonstrated some opposition to the development of skyscrapers from her first months as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government . In November 2006 , she stopped the Brunswick Quay proposal , which represented over £100 million worth of investment into Liverpool , from going ahead . The final report of the planners who carried out the public inquiry had recommended approval for the project . In December 2006 , she called a public inquiry into the 20 Fenchurch Street tower in Londons financial district , on the basis that a tall building would be unsuitable for this site . In May 2007 , she blocked a 42-storey , 120-m tower in the New England Quarter development in Brighton , designed by Allies and Morrison and being planned by the Beetham Organization . She approved the building of new homes and businesses in Walker , Newcastle , in a bid to regenerate the area .\nSecretary of State for Transport .\nRuth Kelly was appointed to the position in Gordon Browns new cabinet on 27 June in a government reshuffle , though it had been speculated she would be removed from the cabinet . Within a few days of entering her job , she faced tough work as she was responsible for securing the publics safety through transport after some attempted terrorist attacks . She came under fire for admitting along with other Labour Ministers that she had smoked cannabis as a teenager .\nSupport for biofuels .\nKellys support for biofuels drew criticism from activists who felt that it impoverishes third world farmers to assuage first world environmental guilt . If people starve because of biofuels , Ruth Kelly and her peers will have killed them , wrote environmentalist George Monbiot in The Guardian . Like all such crimes , it is perpetrated by cowards , attacking the weak to avoid confronting the strong .\nRailways .\nRuth Kelly announced a major increase of railway capacity by providing extra trains across the country by 2010 which drew criticism for her London bias as most of the funding would be spent there . Kelly gave the go-ahead in 2007 for billions of pounds of public money to be spent on the Crossrail project in London , which caused outrage amongst MPs in other cities , especially Manchester , who had been told no public transport funding will be given without a congestion charge scheme .\nHeathrow expansion .\nRuth Kelly set out proposals for a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow under new extensive plans . Gordon Brown admitted this was one of the biggest challenges which faced the UK Government over the coming years .\nMisuse of public funds .\nIn November 2007 it emerged that Kelly had misused part of her £10,000 communications allowance for party political material . The funds should have only been used for politically neutral material , and Kelly apologised for breaking the rules .\nCabinet resignation .\nIn September 2008 , Kelly announced her intention to resign from the cabinet to spend more time with her family . This ended her time as Transport Secretary and cabinet minister after four years . She did not stand at the 2010 general election . Damian McBride , a former senior Labour Party strategist , was shifted from being Gordon Browns political spokesman to Number 10 , after criticism of the way he handled Ruth Kellys resignation .\nParliamentary expenses .\nOn 18 May 2009 , Kelly became involved in the MPs expenses scandal when the Daily Telegraph revealed she had claimed a total of £31,000 between 2004 and 2008 for rebuilding , refurbishing , and purchasing appliances for her second home . It was subsequently revealed on 21 May 2009 that some of this money was used to repair damage caused by a burst pipe . Kelly was insured for this damage but did not claim on that insurance after being advised by the fees office that a reasonable amount could be claimed under the allowances system .\nSubsequent career .\nIn May 2010 , Kelly became the Global Head of Client Strategy at HSBC .\nIn 2015 , Kelly left HSBC and was appointed to become Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research and Enterprise at St Marys University , Twickenham .",

    "story": "Charles Grey , 2nd Earl Grey\nCharles Grey , 2nd Earl Grey , ( 13 March 1764 – 17 July 1845 ) , known as Viscount Howick between 1806 and 1807 , was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from November 1830 to July 1834 . He was a descendant of the noble House of Grey and a member of the Whig Party .\nGrey was a long-time leader of multiple reform movements , and as Prime Minister , his government was known for bringing about two notable reforms . The Reform Act 1832 brought about parliamentary reform , bringing changes to the House of Commons . His government also enacted the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 , bringing about the abolition of slavery in most of the British Empire .\nGrey was a strong opponent of the foreign and domestic policies of William Pitt the Younger in the 1790s . In 1807 , he resigned as Foreign Secretary to protest against King George IIIs uncompromising rejection of Catholic Emancipation . Grey finally resigned in 1834 over disagreements in his cabinet regarding Ireland , and retired from politics . Scholars rank him highly among British prime ministers , believing that he averted much civil strife and enabled Victorian progress .\nEarl Grey tea is named after him .\nEarly life .\nDescended from a long-established Northumbrian family seated at Howick Hall , Grey was the second but eldest surviving son of General Charles Grey KB ( 1729–1807 ) and his wife , Elizabeth ( 1743/4–1822 ) , daughter of George Grey of Southwick , co . Durham . He had four brothers and two sisters . He was educated at Richmond School , followed by Eton and Trinity College , Cambridge , acquiring a facility in Latin and in English composition and declamation that enabled him to become one of the foremost parliamentary orators of his generation .\nTitles .\nHe became the second Earl Grey , Viscount Howick and Baron Grey of Howick on 14 November 1807 upon the death of his father . Upon the death of his uncle on 30 March 1808 he became the third Baronet Grey of Howick .\nGovernment career .\nElected to Parliament , 1786 .\nGrey was elected to Parliament for the Northumberland constituency on 14 September 1786 , aged just 22 . He became a part of the Whig circle of Charles James Fox , Richard Brinsley Sheridan , and the Prince of Wales , and soon became one of the major leaders of the Whig party . He was the youngest manager on the committee for prosecuting Warren Hastings . The Whig historian T . B . Macaulay wrote in 1841 :\nGrey was also noted for advocating Parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation . His affair with Georgiana Cavendish , Duchess of Devonshire , herself an active political campaigner , did him little harm although it nearly caused her to be divorced by her husband .\nForeign Secretary , 1806–1807 .\nIn 1806 , Grey , by then Lord Howick owing to his fathers elevation to the peerage as Earl Grey , became a part of the Ministry of All the Talents ( a coalition of Foxite Whigs , Grenvillites , and Addingtonites ) as First Lord of the Admiralty .\nFollowing Foxs death later that year , Howick took over both as Foreign Secretary and as leader of the Whigs . The ministry broke up in 1807 when George III blocked Catholic Emancipation legislation and required that all ministers individually sign a pledge , which Howick refused to do , that they would not propose any further concessions to the Catholics .\nYears in opposition , 1807–1830 .\nThe government fell from power the next year , and , after a brief period as a member of parliament for Appleby from May to July 1807 , Howick went to the Lords , succeeding his father as Earl Grey . He continued in opposition for the next 23 years . There were times during this period when Grey came close to joining the Government . In 1811 , the Prince Regent tried to court Grey and his ally William Grenville to join the Spencer Perceval ministry following the resignation of Lord Wellesley . Grey and Grenville declined because the Prince Regent refused to make concessions regarding Catholic Emancipation . Greys relationship with the Prince was strained further when his estranged daughter and heiress , Princess Charlotte , turned to him for advice on how to avoid her fathers choice of husband for her .\nOn the Napoleonic Wars , Grey took the standard Whig party line . After being initially enthused by the Spanish uprising against Napoleon , Grey became convinced of the French emperors invincibility following the defeat and death of Sir John Moore , the leader of the British forces in the Peninsular War . Grey was then slow to recognise the military successes of Moores successor , the Duke of Wellington . When Napoleon first abdicated in 1814 , Grey objected to the restoration of the Bourbons authoritarian monarchy ; and when Napoleon was reinstalled the following year , he said that the change was an internal French matter .\nIn 1826 , believing that the Whig party no longer paid any attention to his opinions , Grey stood down as leader in favour of Lord Lansdowne . The following year , when George Canning succeeded Lord Liverpool as Prime Minister , it was therefore Lansdowne and not Grey who was asked to join the Government , which needed strengthening following the resignations of Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington . When Wellington became Prime Minister in 1828 , George IV ( as the Prince Regent had become ) singled out Grey as the one person he could not appoint to the Government .\nPrime Minister ( 1830–1834 ) .\nIn 1830 , following the death of George IV and when the Duke of Wellington resigned on the question of Parliamentary reform , the Whigs finally returned to power , with Grey as Prime Minister . In 1831 , he was made a member of the Order of the Garter . His term was a notable one , seeing passage of the Reform Act 1832 , which finally saw the reform of the House of Commons , and the abolition of slavery throughout almost all of the British Empire in 1833 with the Slavery Abolition Act . As the years had passed , however , Grey had become more conservative , and he was cautious about initiating more far-reaching reforms , particularly since he knew that the King was at best only a reluctant supporter of reform .\nGrey contributed to a plan to found a new colony in South Australia : in 1831 a Proposal to His Majestys Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia was prepared under the auspices of Robert Gouger , Anthony Bacon , Jeremy Bentham and Grey , but its ideas were considered too radical , and it was unable to attract the required investment . In the same year , Grey was appointed to serve on the Government Commission upon Emigration ( which was wound up in 1832 ) .\nIt was the issue of Ireland which precipitated the end of Greys premiership in 1834 . Lord Anglesey , the Viceroy of Ireland , preferred conciliatory reform including the partial redistribution of the income from the church tithe to the Catholic church and away from the established Protestant one , a policy known as appropriation . The Chief Secretary for Ireland , Lord Stanley , however , preferred coercive measures . The cabinet was divided and when Lord John Russell drew attention in the House of Commons to their differences over appropriation , Stanley and others resigned . This triggered Grey to retire from public life , leaving Lord Melbourne as his successor . Unlike most politicians , he seems to have genuinely preferred a private life ; colleagues remarked caustically that he threatened to resign at every setback .\nGrey returned to Howick but kept a close eye on the policies of the new cabinet under Melbourne , whom he , and especially his family , regarded as a mere understudy until he began to act in ways of which they disapproved . Grey became more critical as the decade went on , being particularly inclined to see the hand of Daniel OConnell behind the scenes and blaming Melbourne for subservience to the Radicals with whom he identified the Irish patriot . He made no allowances for Melbournes need to keep the radicals on his side to preserve his shrinking majority in the Commons , and in particular he resented any slight on his own great achievement , the Reform Act , which he saw as a final solution of the question for the foreseeable future . He continually stressed its conservative nature . As he declared in his last great public speech , at the Grey Festival organised in his honour at Edinburgh in September 1834 , its purpose was to strengthen and preserve the established constitution , to make it more acceptable to the people at large , and especially the middle classes , who had been the principal beneficiaries of the Reform Act , and to establish the principle that future changes would be gradual , according to the increased intelligence of the people , and the necessities of the times . It was the speech of a conservative statesman .\nLord Greys ministry , November 1830 – July 1834 .\n- Lord Grey — First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Lords\n- Lord Brougham — Lord Chancellor\n- Lord Lansdowne — Lord President of the Council\n- Lord Durham — Lord Privy Seal\n- Lord Melbourne — Secretary of State for the Home Department\n- Lord Palmerston — Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\n- Lord Goderich — Secretary of State for War and the Colonies\n- Sir James Graham — First Lord of the Admiralty\n- Lord Althorp — Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons\n- Charles Grant — President of the Board of Control\n- Lord Holland — Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n- The Duke of Richmond — Postmaster General\n- Lord Carlisle — Minister without Portfolio\nChanges\n- June 1831 — Lord John Russell , the Paymaster of the Forces , and Edward Smith-Stanley , the Chief Secretary for Ireland , join the Cabinet .\n- April 1833 — Lord Goderich , now Lord Ripon , succeeds Lord Durham as Lord Privy Seal .

    "story": "Carlos P . Romulo\nCarlos Peña Rómulo , ( 14 January 1898 – 15 December 1985 ) was a Filipino diplomat , statesman , soldier , journalist and author . He was a reporter at 16 , a newspaper editor by the age of 20 , and a publisher at 32 . He was a co-founder of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines , a general in the US Army and the Philippine Army , university president , President of the UN General Assembly , was eventually named one of the Philippines National Artists in Literature , and was the recipient of many other honors and honorary degrees . He was born in Camiling , Tarlac and he studied at the Camiling Central Elementary School during his basic education .\nEarly career .\nStudying in the Philippines and the United States , Dr . Carlos Rómulo became a professor of English at the University of the Philippines in 1923 . Simultaneously , Rómulo served as the secretary to the President of the Senate of the Philippines Manuel Quezon . During the 1930s , Rómulo became the publisher and editor of The Philippines Herald , and one of his reporters was Yay Panlilio . At the start of WWII , Major Carlos Rómulo served as an aide to General MacArthur , attaining the rank of general by the end of that war .\nDiplomatic career .\nRómulo served eight Philippine presidents , from Manuel L . Quezon to Ferdinand Marcos , as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and as the countrys representative to the United States and to the United Nations . He also served as the Resident Commissioner to the U.S . House of Representatives during the Commonwealth era . In addition , he served also as the Secretary of Education in President Diosdado P . Macapagals and President Ferdinand E . Marcoss Cabinet through 1962 to 1968 .\nResident Commissioner .\nRómulo served as Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the United States Congress from 1944 to 1946 . This was the title of the non-voting Delegate to the U.S . House of Representatives for lands taken in the Spanish–American War , and as such , he is the only member of the U.S . Congress to end his tenure via a legal secession from the Union .\nUnited Nations .\nIn his career in the United Nations , Rómulo was a strong advocate of human rights , freedom , and decolonization . In 1948 in Paris , France , at the third UN General Assembly , he strongly disagreed with a proposal made by the Soviet delegation headed by Andrei Vishinsky , who challenged his credentials by insulting him with this quote : You are just a little man from a little country . In return , Rómulo replied , It is the duty of the little Davids of this world to fling the pebbles of truth in the eyes of the blustering Goliaths and force them to behave! , leaving Vishinsky with nothing left to do but sit down .\nPalestine Partition Plan .\nIn the days preceding the UN General Assembly vote on the Partition Plan for Palestine , Rómulo stated We hold that the issue is primarily moral . The issue is whether the United Nations should accept responsibility for the enforcement of a policy which is clearly repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine . The Philippines Government holds that the United Nations ought not to accept such responsibility . Thus , he clearly intended to oppose the Partition Plan , or at most abstain in the vote . However , pressure on the Philippines government from Washington led to Rómulo being recalled , replaced by a Philippines representative who voted in favor of the Partition Plan .\nPresident of the UN General Assembly .\nHe served as the President of the Fourth Session of United Nations General Assembly from 1949 to 1950—the first Asian to hold the position—and served as president of the United Nations Security Council four times , twice in 1957 , 1980 and 1981 . He had served with General Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific , and became the first non-American to win the Pulitzer Prize in Correspondence in 1942 . The Pulitzer Prize website says Carlos P . Rómulo of the Philippine Herald was awarded For his observations and forecasts of Far Eastern developments during a tour of the trouble centers from Hong Kong to Batavia .\nCampaign for Secretary-General .\nRómulo ran for the office of United Nations Secretary-General in the 1953 selection . He fell two votes short of the required 7-vote majority in the Security Council , finishing second to Lester B . Pearson of Canada . His ambitions were further dashed by negative votes from France and the Soviet Union , both of whom were permanent members with veto power . The Security Council eventually settled on a dark horse candidate and selected Dag Hammarskjöld as Secretary-General of the United Nations .\nAmbassador to the United States .\nFrom January 1952 to May 1953 , Rómulo became only the second former member of Congress to become the Ambassador to the United States from a foreign country , following Joaquín M . Elizalde , who had been his immediate predecessor in both posts . He later served as Ambassador again from September 1955 to February 1962 .\nReturn to the Philippines .\nPhilippine Presidential Aspiration .\nInstead , he returned to the Philippines and was a candidate for the nomination as the presidential candidate for the Liberal Party , but lost at the party convention to the incumbent Elpidio Quirino , who ran unsuccessfully for re-election against Ramón Magsaysay . Quirino had agreed to a secret ballot at the convention , but after the convention opened , the president demanded an open roll-call voting , leaving the delegates no choice but supporting Quirino , the candidate of the party machine . Feeling betrayed , Romulo left the Liberal Party and became national campaign manager of Magsaysay , the candidate of the opposing Nacionalista Party who won the election .\nMinister of Foreign Affairs .\nHe was the Philippines Secretary ( Minister from 1973 to 1984 ) of Foreign Affairs under President Elpidio Quirino from 1950 to 1952 , under President Diosdado Macapagal from 1963 to 1964 and under President Ferdinand Marcos from 1968 to 1984 . In April 1955 he led the Philippines delegation to the Asian-African Conference at Bandung .\nResignation from the Marcos Cabinet .\nRómulo supported President Ferdinand Marcos through most of his presidency . But he resigned in 1983 , soon after the assassination of Benigno Aquino , citing poor health . Gregorio Brillantes interviewed him in 1984 , and he said he resigned heartsick because of the assassination of Aquino , whom he considered a friend , and the resulting freefall of the Philippines economy and international reputation .\nAccording to Beth Day Rómulo , the Marcos administration had asked him to sign an ad that the administration was planning to place in the New York Times and other major international dailies . Carlos P . Rómulo refused to sign the ad and instead resigned .\nDeath .\nHe died , at 87 , in Manila on 15 December 1985 and was buried in the Heroes Cemetery ( Libingan ng mga Bayani ) . He was honored as one of the truly great statesmen of the 20th century . In 1980 , he was extolled by United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim as Mr . United Nations for his valuable services to the United Nations and his dedication to freedom and world peace .\nPublished books .\nRómulo , in all , wrote and published 22 books , which includes The United ( novel ) , I Walked with Heroes ( autobiography ) , I Saw the Fall of the Philippines , Mother America and I See the Philippines Rise ( war-time memoirs ) .\nHonors .\nNational Honor\n- Quezon Service Cross - ( April 17 , 1951 )\n- Philippine Legion of Honor , Commander\n- National Artist of the Philippines\nAwards and recognitions .\nRómulo is perhaps among the most decorated Filipinos in history , which includes 72 honorary degrees from different international institutions and universities and 144 awards and decorations from foreign countries :\n- Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 1952 For his contribution in international cooperation , in particular on questions on undeveloped areas , and as president for UNs 4th General Assembly\n- United States Presidential Medal of Freedom , January 12 , 1984\n- Boy Scouts of America Silver Buffalo Award\n- Distinguished Service Star of the Philippines\n- Philippine Gold Cross\n- Distinguished Silver Star\n- Purple Heart\n- Presidential Unit Citation with Two Oak Leaf Clusters\n- US Legion of Merit ( Commander )\n- Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix from the Greek Government\n- Grand Cross of the Order of Carlos Manuel do Cespedes from the Republic of Cuba\n- Pulitzer Prize in Correspondence , 1942\n- World Government News First Annual Gold Nadal Award ( for work in the United Nations for peace and world government ) , March 1947\n- Princeton University - Woodrow Wilson Memorial Foundation Gold Medal award ( in recognition of his contribution to public life ) , May 1947\n- International Benjamin Franklin Societys Gold Medal ( for distinguished world statesmanship in 1947 ) , January 1948\n- Freeman of the City of Plymouth , England , October 1948\n- United Nations Peace Medal\n- World Peace Award\n- Four Freedoms Peace Award\n- Philippine Presidential Medal of Merit , July 3 , 1949\n- Hero of the Republic Award , 1984\n- Notre Dame University , Doctor of Laws ( LL.D. ) , 1935\n- Georgetown University , Doctor of Laws ( LL.D. ) , 1960\n- Harvard University , Doctor of Laws ( LL.D. ) , 1950\nAnecdotes from Beth Romulo through Readers Digest ( June 1989 ) .\nAt the third UN General Assembly , held in Paris in 1948 , the USSRs deputy foreign minister , Andrei Vishinsky , sneered at Rómulo and challenged his credentials : You are just a little man from a little country . It is the duty of the little Davids of this world , cried Rómulo , to fling the pebbles of truth in the eyes of the blustering Goliaths and force them to behave !\nDuring his meeting with Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia , Marshal Tito welcomed Gen . Rómulo with drinks and cigars , to which the general kindly refused . Their conversation went as follows :\nAt this , Marshal Tito was tickled by his reply and loudly exclaimed around the room , I etcetera , etcetera , etcetera !\nRómulo was a dapper little man ( barely five feet four inches in shoes ) . When they waded in at Leyte beach in October 1944 , and the word went out that General MacArthur was waist deep , one of Rómulos journalist friends cabled , If MacArthur was in water waist deep , Rómulo must have drowned !\nIn later years , Rómulo told another story himself about a meeting with MacArthur and other tall American generals who disparaged his physical stature .

    "story": "Florence\nFlorence ( ; ) is a city in Central Italy and the capital city of the Tuscany region . It is the most populated city in Tuscany , with 383,084 inhabitants in 2013 , and over 1,520,000 in its metropolitan area .\nFlorence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era . It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance , and has been called the Athens of the Middle Ages . Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions . From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy ( established in 1861 ) . The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri , Petrarch , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini .\nThe city attracts millions of tourists each year , and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982 . The city is noted for its culture , Renaissance art and architecture and monuments . The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries , such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti , and still exerts an influence in the fields of art , culture and politics . Due to Florences artistic and architectural heritage , Forbes has ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world .\nFlorence plays an important role in Italian fashion , and is ranked in the top 15 fashion capitals of the world by Global Language Monitor ; furthermore , it is a major national economic centre , as well as a tourist and industrial hub . In 2008 the city had the 17th-highest average income in Italy .\nHistory .\nFlorence originated as a Roman city , and later , after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking medieval commune , it was the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance . It was politically , economically , and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries .\nThe language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the Italian language . Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans Dante , Petrarch and Boccaccio , Florentine dialect , above all the local dialects , was adopted as the basis for a national literary language .\nStarting from the late Middle Ages , Florentine money—in the form of the gold florin—financed the development of industry all over Europe , from Britain to Bruges , to Lyon and Hungary . Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the Hundred Years War . They similarly financed the papacy , including the construction of their provisional capital of Avignon and , after their return to Rome , the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome .\nFlorence was home to the Medici , one of European historys most important noble families . Lorenzo de Medici was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century . Two members of the family were popes in the early 16th century : Leo X and Clement VII . Catherine de Medici married King Henry II of France and , after his death in 1559 , reigned as regent in France . Marie de Medici married Henry IV of France and gave birth to the future King Louis XIII . The Medici reigned as Grand Dukes of Tuscany , starting with Cosimo I de Medici in 1569 and ending with the death of Gian Gastone de Medici in 1737 .\nRoman origins .\nIn the 9th–8th century BC , the Etruscans formed the small settlement of Fiesole ( Faesulae in Latin ) This was destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 80 BC , in reprisal for supporting the populares faction in Rome . The present city of Florence was established by Julius Caesar in 59 BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally Fluentia , owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers , which was later changed to Florentia ( flowering ) . It was built in the style of an army camp with the main streets , the cardo and the decumanus , intersecting at the present Piazza della Repubblica . Situated along the Via Cassia , the main route between Rome and the north , and within the fertile valley of the Arno , the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre .\nIn centuries to come , the city experienced turbulent periods of Ostrogothic rule , during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines , which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people . Peace returned under Lombard rule in the 6th century . Florence was conquered by Charlemagne in 774 and became part of the Duchy of Tuscany , with Lucca as capital . The population began to grow again and commerce prospered . In 854 , Florence and Fiesole were united in one county .\nSecond millennium .\nMargrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of Lucca at about 1000 AD . The Golden Age of Florentine art began around this time . In 1013 , construction began on the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte . The exterior of the church was reworked in Romanesque style between 1059 and 1128 . In 1100 , Florence was a Commune , meaning a city state . The citys primary resource was the Arno river , providing power and access for the industry ( mainly textile industry ) , and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade . Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community . The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation ( e.g . bills of exchange , double-entry bookkeeping system ) to medieval fairs . This period also saw the eclipse of Florences formerly powerful rival Pisa ( defeated by Genoa in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406 ) , and the exercise of power by the mercantile elite following an anti-aristocratic movement , led by Giano della Bella , that resulted in a set of laws called the Ordinances of Justice ( 1293 ) .\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance .\nRise of the Medici .\nAt the height of demographic expansion around 1325 , the urban population may have been as great as 120,000 , and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000 . The Black Death of 1348 reduced it by over half , about 25,000 are said to have been supported by the citys wool industry : in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers ( ciompi ) , who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the Revolt of the Ciompi . After their suppression , Florence came under the sway ( 1382–1434 ) of the Albizzi family , who became bitter rivals of the Medici .\nIn the 15th century , Florence was among the largest cities in Europe , with a population of 60,000 , and was considered rich and economically successful . Cosimo de Medici was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes . Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts , his power came from a vast patronage network along with his alliance to the new immigrants , the gente nuova ( new people ) . The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy . Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero , who was , soon after , succeeded by Cosimos grandson , Lorenzo in 1469 . Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts , commissioning works by Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli . Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence , including Alexander Agricola , Johannes Ghiselin , and Heinrich Isaac . By contemporary Florentines ( and since ) , he was known as Lorenzo the Magnificent ( Lorenzo il Magnifico ) .\nFollowing Lorenzo de Medicis death in 1492 , he was succeeded by his son Piero II . When the French king Charles VIII invaded northern Italy , Piero II chose to resist his army . But when he realised the size of the French army at the gates of Pisa , he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king . These made the Florentines rebel , and they expelled Piero II . With his exile in 1494 , the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government .\nSavonarola , Machiavelli , and the Medici Popes .\nDuring this period , the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola had become prior of the San Marco monastery in 1490 . He was famed for his penitential sermons , lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches . He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God , punishing them for their decadence . He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule . But when Savonarola publicly accused Pope Alexander VI of corruption , he was banned from speaking in public . When he broke this ban , he was excommunicated . The Florentines , tired of his extreme teachings , turned against him and arrested him . He was convicted as a heretic and burned at the stake on the Piazza della Signoria on 23 May 1498 .\nA second individual of unusually acute insight was Niccolò Machiavelli , whose prescriptions for Florences regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice . In other words , Machiavelli was a political thinker , perhaps most renowned for his political handbook , titled The Prince , which is about ruling and the exercise of power . Commissioned by the Medici , Machiavelli also wrote the Florentine Histories , the history of the city . Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527 . Restored twice with the support of both Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII ( Giulio de Medici ) , the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence , and in 1569 Grand Dukes of Tuscany , ruling for two centuries . In all Tuscany , only the Republic of Lucca ( later a Duchy ) and the Principality of Piombino were independent from Florence .\n18th and 19th centuries .\nThe extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen , duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria , led to Tuscanys temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown . It became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty , who were deposed for the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801 . From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the Napoleonic client state Kingdom of Etruria . The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France . Florence was the prefecture of the French département of Arno from 1808 to the fall of Napoleon in 1814 . The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the Congress of Vienna but finally deposed in 1859 . Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 .\nFlorence replaced Turin as Italys capital in 1865 and , in an effort to modernise the city , the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses . The Piazza ( first renamed Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II , then Piazza della Repubblica , the present name ) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end . This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city . A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today .\nThe countrys second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later , after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the capture of Rome .\n20th century .\nDuring World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation ( 1943–1944 ) being part of the Italian Social Republic . Hitler declared it an open city on 3 July 1944 as troops of the British 8th Army closed in . In early August , the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the Arno linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city , making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross . However , at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin , at the time consul of 26 countries in Florence , convinced the German general in Italy that the Ponte Vecchio was not to be destroyed due to its historical value . Instead , an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge , including part of the Corridoio Vasariano , was destroyed using mines . Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible , but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design . Shortly before leaving Florence , as they knew that they would soon have to retreat , the Germans executed many freedom fighters and political opponents publicly , in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito .\nFlorence was liberated by New Zealand , South African and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the Tuscan Committee of National Liberation ( CTLN ) . The Allied soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city ( Americans about south of the city , British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno ) .\nAt the end of World War II in May 1945 , the US Armys Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence , Italy . The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence , Italy . Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions ( see G . I . American Universities ) .\nIn November 1966 , the Arno flooded parts of the centre , damaging many art treasures . Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point .\nGeography .\nFlorence lies in a basin formed by the hills of Careggi , Fiesole , Settignano , Arcetri , Poggio Imperiale and Bellosguardo ( Florence ) . The Arno river , three other minor rivers ( Mugnone , Ema and Greve ) and some streams flow through it .\nClimate .\nFlorence has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) , tending to Mediterranean ( Csa ) . It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool , damp winters . As Florence lacks a prevailing wind , summer temperatures are higher than along the coast . Rainfall in summer is convectional , while relief rainfall dominates in the winter . Snow flurries occur almost every year , but often result in no accumulation . The highest officially recorded temperature was on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was on 12 January 1985 .\nGovernment .\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council ( Consiglio Comunale ) , which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system , at the same time as the mayoral elections . The executive body is the City Committee ( Giunta Comunale ) , composed of 7 assessors , nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor . The current mayor of Florence is Dario Nardella .\nThe municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs ( Quartieri ) . Each borough is governed by a Council ( Consiglio ) and a President , elected at the same time as the city mayor . The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution ( art . 114 ) . The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics ( environment , construction , public health , local markets ) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council ; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities . The boroughs are :\n- Q1 – Centro storico ( Historic Centre ) ; population : 67,170 ;\n- Q2 – Campo di Marte ; population : 88,588 ;\n- Q3 – Gavinana-Galluzzo ; population : 40,907 ;\n- Q4 – Isolotto-Legnaia ; population : 66,636 ;\n- Q5 – Rifredi ; population : 103,761 .\nAll of the five boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party .\nThe former Italian Prime Minister ( 2014–2016 ) , Matteo Renzi , served as mayor from 2009 to 2014 .\nMain sights .\nFlorence is known as the cradle of the Renaissance ( la culla del Rinascimento ) for its monuments , churches , and buildings . The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city , Santa Maria del Fiore , known as The Duomo , whose dome was built by Filippo Brunelleschi . The nearby Campanile ( partly designed by Giotto ) and the Baptistery buildings are also highlights . The dome , 600 years after its completion , is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world . In 1982 , the historic centre of Florence ( Italian : centro storico di Firenze ) was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO . The centre of the city is contained in medieval walls that were built in the 14th century to defend the city . At the heart of the city , in Piazza della Signoria , is Bartolomeo Ammannatis Fountain of Neptune ( 1563–1565 ) , which is a masterpiece of marble sculpture at the terminus of a still functioning Roman aqueduct .\nThe layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era , where it was designed as a garrison settlement . Nevertheless , the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance . Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city , traces of medieval , Baroque , Neoclassical and modern architecture can be found . The Palazzo Vecchio as well as the Duomo , or the citys Cathedral , are the two buildings which dominate Florences skyline .\nThe river Arno , which cuts through the old part of the city , is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there . Historically , the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno – which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce , and destroying it by flood .\nOne of the bridges in particular stands out – the Ponte Vecchio ( Old Bridge ) , whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges , held up by stilts . The bridge also carries Vasaris elevated corridor linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ( Palazzo Pitti ) . Although the original bridge was constructed by the Etruscans , the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century . It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War II intact . It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental arches , that is , arches less than a semicircle , to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed ( being in this much more successful than the Roman Alconétar Bridge ) .\nThe church of San Lorenzo contains the Medici Chapel , the mausoleum of the Medici family—the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century . Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery , one of the finest art museums in the world – founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family .\nThe Uffizi is located at the corner of Piazza della Signoria , a site important for being the centre of Florences civil life and government for centuries . The Palazzo della Signoria facing it is still home of the municipal government . Many significant episodes in the history of art and political changes were staged here , such as :\n- In 1301 , Dante Alighieri was sent into exile from here ( commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi ) .\n- On 26 April 1478 , Jacopo de Pazzi and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as La congiura dei Pazzi ( The Pazzi conspiracy ) , murdering Giuliano di Piero de Medici and wounding his brother Lorenzo . All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace .\n- In 1497 , it was the location of the Bonfire of the Vanities instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher Girolamo Savonarola\n- On 23 May 1498 , the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake . ( A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged )\n- In 1504 , Michelangelos David ( now replaced by a replica , since the original was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dellAccademia ) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria ( also known as Palazzo Vecchio ) .\nThe Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as Donatello , Giambologna , Ammannati and Cellini , although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals .\nMonuments , museums and religious buildings .\nFlorence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras . The Palazzo Vecchio is the town hall of Florence and also an art museum . This large Romanesque crenellated fortress-palace overlooks the Piazza della Signoria with its copy of Michelangelos David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi . Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria , after the Signoria of Florence , the ruling body of the Republic of Florence , it was also given several other names : Palazzo del Popolo , Palazzo dei Priori , and Palazzo Ducale , in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history . The building acquired its current name when the Medici dukes residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti . It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the Corridoio Vasariano .\nPalazzo Medici Riccardi , designed by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo for Cosimo il Vecchio , of the Medici family , is another major edifice , and was built between 1445 and 1460 . It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar . Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the Riccardiana Library . The Palazzo Strozzi , an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone , was inspired by the Palazzo Medici , but with more harmonious proportions . Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show ( founded as the Biennale dellAntiquariato in 1959 ) , fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events . Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux , with the library and reading room .\nThere are several other notable places , including the Palazzo Rucellai , designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed , at least in part , by Bernardo Rossellino ; the Palazzo Davanzati , which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House ; the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali , designed in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1871 ; the Palazzo Spini Feroni , in Piazza Santa Trinita , a historic 13th-century private palace , owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer Salvatore Ferragamo ; as well as various others , including the Palazzo Borghese , the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello , the Palazzo Antinori , and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella .\nFlorence contains numerous museums and art galleries where some of the worlds most important works of art are held . The city is one of the best preserved Renaissance centres of art and architecture in the world and has a high concentration of art , architecture and culture . In the ranking list of the 15 most visited Italian art museums , ⅔ are represented by Florentine museums . The Uffizi is one of these , having a very large collection of international and Florentine art . The gallery is articulated in many halls , catalogued by schools and chronological order . Engendered by the Medici familys artistic collections through the centuries , it houses works of art by various painters and artists . The Vasari Corridor is another gallery , built connecting the Palazzo Vecchio with the Pitti Palace passing by the Uffizi and over the Ponte Vecchio . The Galleria dellAccademia houses a Michelangelo collection , including the David . It has a collection of Russian icons and works by various artists and painters . Other museums and galleries include the Bargello , which concentrates on sculpture works by artists including Donatello , Giambologna and Michelangelo ; the Palazzo Pitti , containing part of the Medici familys former private collection . In addition to the Medici collection , the palaces galleries contain many Renaissance works , including several by Raphael and Titian , large collections of costumes , ceremonial carriages , silver , porcelain and a gallery of modern art dating from the 18th century . Adjoining the palace are the Boboli Gardens , elaborately landscaped and with numerous sculptures .\nThere are several different churches and religious buildings in Florence . The cathedral is Santa Maria del Fiore . The San Giovanni Baptistery located in front of the cathedral , is decorated by numerous artists , notably by Lorenzo Ghiberti with the Gates of Paradise . Other churches in Florence include the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella , located in Santa Maria Novella square ( near the Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station ) which contains works by Masaccio , Paolo Uccello , Filippino Lippi and Domenico Ghirlandaio ; the Basilica of Santa Croce , the principal Franciscan church in the city , which is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce , about south east of the Duomo , and is the burial place of some of the most illustrious Italians , such as Michelangelo , Galileo , Machiavelli , Foscolo , Rossini , thus it is known also as the Temple of the Italian Glories ( Tempio dellItale Glorie ) ; the Basilica of San Lorenzo , which is one of the largest churches in the city , situated at the centre of Florences main market district , and the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III ; Santo Spirito , in the Oltrarno quarter , facing the square with the same name ; Orsanmichele , whose building was constructed on the site of the kitchen garden of the monastery of San Michele , now demolished ; Santissima Annunziata , a Roman Catholic basilica and the mother church of the Servite order ; Ognissanti , which was founded by the lay order of the Umiliati , and is among the first examples of Baroque architecture built in the city ; the Santa Maria del Carmine , in the Oltrarno district of Florence , which is the location of the Brancacci Chapel , housing outstanding Renaissance frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale , later finished by Filippino Lippi ; the Medici Chapel with statues by Michelangelo , in the San Lorenzo ; as well as several others , including Santa Trinita , San Marco , Santa Felicita , Badia Fiorentina , San Gaetano , San Miniato al Monte , Florence Charterhouse , and Santa Maria del Carmine . The city additionally contains the Orthodox Russian church of Nativity , and the Great Synagogue of Florence , built in the 19th century .\nFlorence contains various theatres and cinemas . The Odeon Cinema of the Palazzo dello Strozzino is one of the oldest cinemas in the city . Established from 1920 to 1922 in a wing of the Palazzo dello Strozzino , it used to be called the Cinema Teatro Savoia ( Savoy Cinema-Theatre ) , yet was later called Odeon . The Teatro della Pergola , located in the centre of the city on the eponymous street , is an opera house built in the 17th century . Another theatre is the Teatro Comunale ( or Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino ) , originally built as the open-air amphitheatre , the Politeama Fiorentino Vittorio Emanuele , which was inaugurated on 17 May 1862 with a production of Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor and which seated 6,000 people . There are several other theatres , such as the Saloncino Castinelli , the Teatro Puccini , the Teatro Verdi , the Teatro Goldoni and the Teatro Niccolini .\nCathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore .\nFlorence Cathedral , formally the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore , is the cathedral of Florence , Italy . It was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436 , with the dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi .\nSquares , streets and parks .\nAside from such monuments , Florence contains numerous major squares ( piazze ) and streets . The Piazza della Repubblica is a square in the city centre , location of the cultural cafés and bourgeois palaces . Among the squares cafés ( like Caffè Gilli , Paszkowski or the Hard Rock Cafè ) , the Giubbe Rosse café has long been a meeting place for artists and writers , notably those of Futurism . The Piazza Santa Croce is another ; dominated by the Basilica of Santa Croce , it is a rectangular square in the centre of the city where the Calcio Fiorentino is played every year . Furthermore , there is the Piazza Santa Trinita , a square near the Arno that mark the end of the Via de Tornabuoni street .\nOther squares include the Piazza San Marco , the Piazza Santa Maria Novella , the Piazza Beccaria and the Piazza della Libertà . The centre additionally contains several streets . Such include the Via Camillo Cavour , one of the main roads of the northern area of the historic centre ; the Via Ghibellina , one of central Florences longest streets ; the Via dei Calzaiuoli , one of the most central streets of the historic centre which links Piazza del Duomo to Piazza della Signoria , winding parallel to via Roma and Piazza della Repubblica ; the Via de Tornabuoni , a luxurious street in the city centre that goes from Antinori square to ponte Santa Trinita , across Piazza Santa Trinita , characterised by the presence of fashion boutiques ; the Viali di Circonvallazione , 6-lane boulevards surrounding the northern part of the historic centre ; as well as others , such as Via Roma , Via degli Speziali , Via de Cerretani , and the Viale dei Colli .\nFlorence also contains various parks and gardens . Such include the Boboli Gardens , the Parco delle Cascine , the Giardino Bardini and the Giardino dei Semplici , amongst others .\nDemographics .\nIn 1200 the city was home to 50,000 people . By 1300 the population of the city proper was 120,000 , with an additional 300,000 living in the Contado . Between 1500 and 1650 the population was around 70,000 .\n, the population of the city proper is 370,702 , while Eurostat estimates that 696,767 people live in the urban area of Florence . The Metropolitan Area of Florence , Prato and Pistoia , constituted in 2000 over an area of roughly , is home to 1.5 million people . Within Florence proper , 46.8% of the population was male in 2007 and 53.2% were female . Minors ( children aged 18 and less ) totalled 14.10 percent of the population compared to pensioners , who numbered 25.95 percent . This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent ( minors ) and 19.94 percent ( pensioners ) . The average age of Florence resident is 49 compared to the Italian average of 42 . In the five years between 2002 and 2007 , the population of Florence grew by 3.22 percent , while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent . The birth rate of Florence is 7.66 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births .\n, 87.46% of the population was Italian . An estimated 6,000 Chinese live in the city . The largest immigrant group came from other European countries ( mostly Romanians and Albanians ) : 3.52% , East Asia ( mostly Chinese and Filipino ) : 2.17% , the Americas : 1.41% , and North Africa ( mostly Moroccan ) : 0.9% .\nMuch like the rest of Italy most of the people in Florence are Roman Catholic , with more than 90% of the population belonging to the Archdiocese of Florence .\nEconomy .\nTourism is , by far , the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city . The value tourism to the city totalled some €2.5 billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year .\nIn 2013 , Florence was listed as the second best world city by Condé Nast Traveler .\nManufacturing and commerce , however , still remain highly important . Florence is also Italys 17th richest city in terms of average workers earnings , with the figure being €23,265 ( the overall citys income is €6,531,204,473 ) , coming after Mantua , yet surpassing Bolzano .\nIndustry , commerce and services .\nFlorence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy , where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods , from furniture , rubber goods , chemicals , and food . However , traditional and local products , such as antiques , handicrafts , glassware , leatherwork , art reproductions , jewellery , souvenirs , elaborate metal and iron-work , shoes , accessories and high fashion clothes also dominate a fair sector of Florences economy . The citys income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests , such as annual fairs , theatrical and lyrical productions , art exhibitions , festivals and fashion shows , such as the Calcio Fiorentino . Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income . In Nuovo Pignone , numerous factories are still present , and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant . The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the Third Italy in the 1990s , due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile ( especially the Vespa ) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs . Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto due to high profits and productivity .\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015 , manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2% . Leading sectors included mechanical engineering , fashion , pharmaceutics , food and wine . During 2015 , permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent , boosted by nationwide tax break .\nTourism .\nTourism is the most significant industry in central Florence . From April to October , tourists outnumber local population . Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella , both of which charge for entry . Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting . In 2010 , readers of Travel + Leisure magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination . In 2015 , Condé Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe .\nStudies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe .\nFlorence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art ( in proportion to its size ) in the world . Thus , cultural tourism is particularly strong , with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93 million tickets in 2014 . The citys convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions , conferences , meetings , social forums , concerts and other events all year .\nIn 2016 , Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities . International visitors use 75% of the rooms ; some 18% of those were from the U.S . In 2014 , the city had 8.5 million overnight stays . A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the worlds 36th most visited in the world , with over 4.95 million arrivals for the year .\nTourism brings revenue to Florence , but also creates certain problems . The Ponte Vecchio , The San Lorenzo Market and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets . The province of Florence receives roughly 13 million visitors per year and in peak seasons , popular locations may become overcrowded as a result . In 2015 , Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern over visitors who arrive on buses , stay only a few hours , spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding . No museum visit , just a photo from the square , the bus back and then on to Venice.. . We don’t want tourists like that , he said .\nSome tourists are less than respectful of the citys cultural heritage , according to Nardella . In June 2017 , he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots . While he values the benefits of tourism , he claims that there has been an increase among those who sit down on church steps , eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them , he explained . To boost the sale of traditional foods , the mayor had introduced legislation ( enacted in 2016 ) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonalds application to open a location in the Piazza del Duomo .\nFood and wine production .\nFood and wine have long been an important staple of the economy . The Chianti region is just south of the city , and its Sangiovese grapes figure prominently not only in its Chianti Classico wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends . Within to the west is the Carmignano area , also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds . The celebrated Chianti Rufina district , geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region , is also few kilometres east of Florence . More recently , the Bolgheri region ( about southwest of Florence ) has become celebrated for its Super Tuscan reds such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia .\nCulture .\nArt .\nFlorence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art , which lasted from 1450 to 1527 . While Medieval art focused on basic story telling of the Bible , Renaissance art focused on naturalism and human emotion . Medieval art was abstract , formulaic , and largely produced by monks whereas Renaissance art was rational , mathematical , individualistic , consisted of linear perspective and shading ( Chiaroscuro ) and produced by specialists ( Leonardo da Vinci , Donatello , Michelangelo , and Raphael ) . Religion was important , but with this new age came the humanization of religious figures in art , such as Expulsion from the Garden of Eden , Ecce Homo ( Bosch , 1470s ) , and Madonna Della Seggiola ; People of this age began to understand themselves as human beings , which reflected in art . The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world ; Art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism .\nCimabue and Giotto , the fathers of Italian painting , lived in Florence as well as Arnolfo and Andrea Pisano , renewers of architecture and sculpture ; Brunelleschi , Donatello and Masaccio , forefathers of the Renaissance , Ghiberti and the Della Robbias , Filippo Lippi and Angelico ; Botticelli , Paolo Uccello and the universal genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo .\nTheir works , together with those of many other generations of artists , are gathered in the several museums of the town : the Uffizi Gallery , the Palatina gallery with the paintings of the Golden Ages , the Bargello with the sculptures of the Renaissance , the museum of San Marco with Fra Angelicos works , the Academy , the chapels of the Medicis Buonarrotis house with the sculptures of Michelangelo , the following museums : Bardini , Horne , Stibbert , Romano , Corsini , The Gallery of Modern Art , the Museo dellOpera del Duomo , the museum of Silverware and the museum of Precious Stones .\nSeveral monuments are located in Florence : the Florence Baptistery with its mosaics ; the cathedral with its sculptures , the medieval churches with bands of frescoes ; public as well as private palaces : Palazzo Vecchio , Palazzo Pitti , Palazzo Medici Riccardi , Palazzo Davanzati ; monasteries , cloisters , refectories ; the Certosa . In the archaeological museum includes documents of Etruscan civilisation . In fact the city is so rich in art that some first time visitors experience the Stendhal syndrome as they encounter its art for the first time .\nFlorentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi ( 1377–1466 ) and Leon Battista Alberti ( 1404–1472 ) were among the fathers of both Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture .\nThe cathedral , topped by Brunelleschis dome , dominates the Florentine skyline . The Florentines decided to start building it – late in the 13th century , without a design for the dome . The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time , and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times – the Pantheon in Rome , and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople . The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world . In front of it is the medieval Baptistery . The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance . In recent years , most of the important works of art from the two buildings – and from the nearby Giottos Campanile , have been removed and replaced by copies . The originals are now housed in the Museum dellOpera del Duomo , just to the east of the cathedral .\nFlorence has large numbers of art-filled churches , such as San Miniato al Monte , San Lorenzo , Santa Maria Novella , Santa Trinita , Santa Maria del Carmine , Santa Croce , Santo Spirito , the Annunziata , Ognissanti and numerous others .\nArtists associated with Florence range from Arnolfo di Cambio and Cimabue to Giotto , Nanni di Banco , and Paolo Uccello ; through Lorenzo Ghiberti , and Donatello and Massaccio and the della Robbia family ; through Fra Angelico and Botticelli and Piero della Francesca , and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci . Others include Benvenuto Cellini , Andrea del Sarto , Benozzo Gozzoli , Domenico Ghirlandaio , Filippo Lippi , Bernardo Buontalenti , Orcagna , Pollaiuolo , Filippino Lippi , Verrocchio , Bronzino , Desiderio da Settignano , Michelozzo , the Rossellis , the Sangallos , and Pontormo . Artists from other regions who worked in Florence include Raphael , Andrea Pisano , Giambologna , Il Sodoma and Peter Paul Rubens .\nPicture galleries in Florence include the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace . Two superb collections of sculpture are in the Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo . They are filled with the creations of Donatello , Verrochio , Desiderio da Settignano , Michelangelo and others . The Galleria dellAccademia has Michelangelos David – perhaps the best-known work of art anywhere , plus the unfinished statues of the slaves Michelangelo created for the tomb of Pope Julius II . Other sights include the medieval city hall , the Palazzo della Signoria ( also known as the Palazzo Vecchio ) , the Archeological Museum , the Museum of the History of Science , the Garden of Archimedes , the Palazzo Davanzatti , the Stibbert Museum , St . Marks , the Medici Chapels , the Museum of the Works of Santa Croce , the Museum of the Cloister of Santa Maria Novella , the Zoological Museum ( La Specola ) , the Bardini , and the Museo Horne . There is also a collection of works by the modern sculptor , Marino Marini , in a museum named after him . The Strozzi Palace is the site of special exhibits .\nLanguage .\nFlorentine ( fiorentino ) , spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs , is a Tuscan dialect and the immediate parent language to modern Italian .\nAlthough its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian , differences do exist . The Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo ( Dictionary of Modern Florentine ) reveals lexical distinctions from all walks of life . Florentines have a highly recognisable accent in phonetic terms due to the so-called gorgia toscana ) : hard c between two vowels is pronounced as a fricative similar to an English h , so that dico I say is phonetically , i cani the dogs is . Similarly , t between vowels is pronounced as in English thin , and p in the same position is the bilabial fricative . Other traits include using a form of the subjunctive mood last commonly used in medieval times , a frequent usage in everyday speech of the modern subjunctive , and a shortened pronunciation of the definite article , instead of il , causing doubling of the consonant that follows , so that il cane the dog , for example , is pronounced .\nDante , Petrarch , and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time .\nLiterature .\nDespite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages , writers such as Dante Alighieri and many others used their own language , the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin , in composing their greatest works . The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century . Florences literature fully blossomed in the 14th century , when not only Dante with his Divine Comedy ( 1306–1321 ) and Petrarch , but also poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Lapo Gianni composed their most important works . Dantes masterpiece is the Divine Comedy , which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell , Purgatory and finally Heaven , during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before . He is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil , whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell . Later on he is joined by Beatrice , who guides him through Heaven .\nIn the 14th century , Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio led the literary scene in Florence after Dantes death in 1321 . Petrarch was an all-rounder writer , author and poet , but was particularly known for his Canzoniere , or the Book of Songs , where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura . His style of writing has since become known as Petrarchism . Boccaccio was better known for his Decameron , a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague , known as the Black Death , when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion , and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition . All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas .\nIn the 16th century , during the Renaissance , Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli , whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land , detailed in The Prince , spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries . These principles became known as Machiavellianism .\nMusic .\nFlorence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture . The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence . During the Renaissance , there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music : state , corporate , church , and private . It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result—in other words , the first operas , setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form , but for later developments of separate classical forms such as the symphony and concerto . After the year 1600 , Italian trends prevailed across Europe , by 1750 it was the primary musical language . The genre of the Madrigal , born in Italy , gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere . Several Italian cities were larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested . Florence , was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation , including the beginning and flourishing of opera .\nOpera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacobo Peris Dafne an opera in the style of monody , was premiered . Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe . Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time . At the beginning of the 17th century , two practices for writing music were devised , one the first practice or Stile Antico/Prima Prattica the other the Stile Moderno/Seconda Prattica . The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time .\nThe piano was invented in Florence in 1709 by Bartolomeo Cristofori .\nComposers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi ( 1550 – after 1608 ) , Giulio Caccini ( 1551–1618 ) and Mike Francis ( 1961–2009 ) . Giulio Caccinis book Le Nuove Musiche was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time . The book specified a new term , in use by the 1630s , called monody which indicated the combination of voice and basso continuo and connoted a practice of stating text in a free , lyrical , yet speech-like manner . This would occur while an instrument , usually a keyboard type such as harpsichord , played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line .\nCinema .\nFlorence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies , including the novels and associated films , such as Light in the Piazza , The Girl Who Couldnt Say No , Calmi Cuori Appassionati , Hannibal , A Room with a View , Tea with Mussolini , Virgin Territory and Inferno . The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses , such as Roberto Benigni , Leonardo Pieraccioni and Vittoria Puccini .\nVideo games .\nFlorence has appeared as a location in video games such as Assassins Creed II . The Republic of Florence also appears as a playable nation in Paradox Interactives grand strategy game Europa Universalis IV .\nOther Media .\n16th century Florence is the setting of the Japanese manga and anime series Arte .\nCuisine .\nFlorentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking . The majority of dishes are based on meat . The whole animal was traditionally eaten ; tripe ( trippa ) and stomach ( lampredotto ) were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city . Antipasti include crostini toscani , sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based pâté , and sliced meats ( mainly prosciutto and salame , often served with melon when in season ) . The typically saltless Tuscan bread , obtained with natural levain frequently features in Florentine courses , especially in its soups , ribollita and pappa al pomodoro , or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called panzanella that is served in summer . The bistecca alla fiorentina is a large ( the customary size should weigh around ) – the date steak – T-bone steak of Chianina beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version , the tagliata , sliced rare beef served on a bed of arugula , often with slices of Parmesan cheese on top . Most of these courses are generally served with local olive oil , also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation . Among the desserts , schiacciata alla fiorentina , a white flatbread cake , is one of the most popular ; it is a very soft cake , prepared with extremely simple ingredients , typical of Florentine cuisine , and is especially eaten at Carnival .\nResearch activity .\nResearch institutes and university departments are located within the Florence area and within two campuses at\nPolo di Novoli and Polo Scientifico di Sesto Fiorentino as well as in the Research Area of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche .\nScience and discovery .\nFlorence has been an important scientific centre for centuries , notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci .\nFlorentines were one of the driving forces behind the Age of Discovery . Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East . It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli , a student of Brunelleschi , that Christopher Columbus used to sell his enterprise to the Spanish monarchs , and which he used on his first voyage . Mercators Projection is a refined version of Toscanellis , taking the Americas into account .\nGalileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics , ballistics , astronomy , anatomy , and other scientific disciplines . Pico della Mirandola , Leonardo Bruni , Machiavelli , and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding .\nFashion .\nBy the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe . Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing , and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated . Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern ( post World War Two ) fashion industry in Italy . The Florentine soirées of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention . Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928 . Gucci , Roberto Cavalli , and Emilio Pucci are also headquartered in Florence . Other major players in the fashion industry such as Prada and Chanel have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts . Florences main upscale shopping street is Via de Tornabuoni , where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels , such as Armani and Bulgari , have their elegant boutiques . Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores .\nHistorical evocations .\nScoppio del Carro .\nThe Scoppio del Carro ( Explosion of the Cart ) is a celebration of the First Crusade .

John the Baptist ( Battistero di San Giovanni ) and the Florence Cathedral ( Santa Maria del Fiore ) . The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church . Near the cart there is a model of a dove , which , according to legend , is a symbol of good luck for the city : at the end of the Easter mass , the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart .\nCalcio Storico .\nCalcio Storico Fiorentino ( Historic Florentine Football ) , sometimes called Calcio in costume , is a traditional sport , regarded as a forerunner of soccer , though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby . The event originates from the Middle Ages , when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes . The most important match was played on 17 February 1530 , during the siege of Florence . That day Papal troops besieged the city while the Florentines , with contempt of the enemies , decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation . The game is played in the Piazza di Santa Croce . A temporary arena is constructed , with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field . A series of matches are held between four teams representing each quartiere ( quarter ) of Florence during late June and early July .

This area is commonly referred to as the ZTL ( Zona Traffico Limitato ) , which is divided into several subsections . Residents of one section , therefore , will only be able to drive in their district and perhaps some surrounding ones . Cars without permits are allowed to enter after 7.30 pm , or before 7.30 am . The rules shift during the tourist-filled summers , putting more restrictions on where one can get in and out .\nBuses .\nThe principal public transit network in the city is run by the ATAF and Li-nea bus company . Individual tickets , or a pass called Carta Agile with multiple rides , are purchased in advance and must be validated once on board . These tickets may be used on ATAF and Li-nea buses , Tramvia and second-class local trains only within city railway stations . Train tickets must be validated before boarding . The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella railway station . Trenitalia runs trains between the railway stations within the city , and to other destinations around Italy and Europe . The central railway station , Santa Maria Novella , is about northwest of the Piazza del Duomo . There are two other important stations : Campo di Marte and Rifredi . Most bundled routes are Firenze—Pisa , Firenze—Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo ( along the main line to Rome ) .

The transit companies also accommodate travellers from the Amerigo Vespucci Airport , which is west of the city centre , and which has scheduled services run by major European carriers .\nTrams .\nIn an effort to reduce air pollution and car traffic in the city , a multi-line tram network called Tramvia is under construction . The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florences primary intercity railway station ( Santa Maria Novella ) with the southwestern suburb of Scandicci . This line is long and has 14 stops . The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011 , construction was stopped due to contractors difficulties and restarted in 2014 with the new line opening on 11 February 2019 .

    "story": "Bernard Joy\nBernard Joy ( 29 October 1911 – 18 July 1984 ) was an English footballer and journalist . He is notable for being the last amateur player to play for the England national football team .\nBiography .\nJoy was born in Fulham , London and educated at Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School . He studied at the University of London , playing in his spare time for the university football side at centre half . After graduating , he played for Casuals , where he eventually became club captain , leading them to victory in the 1936 FA Amateur Cup final . He also won ten caps for the England amateur team and was captain of the Great Britain football side at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin . Bernard was father to Christopher Margaret and Karen Joy .\nWhile still registered as a Casuals player , Joy also played for several other clubs in an amateur capacity , including Southend United ( 1931–33 ) and Fulham ( 1933–34 ) . In May 1935 he joined Arsenal , then First Division champions . Joy mainly played as a reserve , only playing two games in his first season – he didnt make his debut for Arsenal until 1 April 1936 against Bolton Wanderers . Arsenal won the FA Cup that season but Joy played no part in the final .\nHowever , he did gain recognition at international level soon after , when on 9 May 1936 , he played for England in their 3–2 loss against Belgium , making him the last amateur to play for the national side ; given the gulf in quality between the professional and amateur games in the modern day , it is exceedingly unlikely Joys record will ever be taken by another player . Although Joy was playing for Arsenal at the time , he was still registered as a Casuals player and he is recorded in the England history books as playing for them at the time , not Arsenal .\nJoy continued to play for Arsenal , mainly deputising for the Gunners established centre-half Herbie Roberts . Roberts suffered a broken leg in October 1937 and Joy took his place in the side for the remainder of the 1937-38 season , winning a First Division winners medal , and then , with Roberts having retired from the game , on through the 1938-39 season ( earning a 1938 Charity Shield winners medal in the process ) .\nWith the advent of World War II , Joy signed up to join the Royal Air Force where he was an PE instructor , though he still turned out for Arsenal ( playing over 200 wartime matches ) and won an unofficial wartime England cap . In June 1940 , he was one of five Arsenal players who guested for Southampton in a victory over Fulham at Craven Cottage .\nHe also appeared as a guest player for West Ham United later in World War II making two appearances .\nWhen peace broke out and first-class football resumed , he played the first half of the 1946-47 season before deciding that his age ( 35 ) was counting against him ; he retired from top-flight football in December 1946 , though he carried on playing for Casuals until 1948 . In all , he played 95 first-class ( i.e . non-wartime ) matches for Arsenal , though he never scored a goal .\nBefore the war Joy was a teacher , but afterwards he decided not to return to the profession and moved into journalism . Joy began his career in journalism as a football writer on The Star , one of three London evening papers published in the 1940s . He later moved to the Evening Standard and the Sunday Express as football and lawn tennis correspondent until retirement in 1976 .\nHe also wrote one of the first histories of Arsenal Football Club , Forward , Arsenal ! ( 1952 ) , and several other football books . He died in 1984 , aged 72 of cancer . He often held dinner parties at his house in Osterley which many footballing celebrities would attend .\nHonours .\nWith Arsenal .\nWinner :\n- First Division : 1937-38\n- FA Charity Shield ( now the FA Community Shield ) : 1938\nWith Casuals .\nWinner :\n- FA Amateur Cup : 1936\nExternal links .\n- Profile at www.englandstats.com\n- Profile at www.englandfc.com",

    "story": "Louis Ngwat-Mahop\nHe started his career in his hometowns club Dragon Club de Yaoundé before being signed by German giants FC Bayern Munich in 2006 . He played with them for one season , featuring mainly in matches of Bayern Munich II in the Regionalliga Süd . After being released by FC Bayern Munich in the summer of 2007 , due to issues that arose with his French passport , he signed for Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg . At first he was assigned to play in the Regionalliga West with the clubs reserve squad , Red Bull Salzburg Juniors , but he managed to make it to the first team . In total , Ngwat-Mahop spent three and a half years with the Austrian club , managing to win the Austrian Bundesliga in no less than two occasions . In January 2011 he signed for Greek Superleague outfit Iraklis . He played for Karlsruher SC for the 2011–12 season before signing for Rheindorf Altach in 2012 .\nCareer .\nEarly life and career .\nNgwat-Mahop was born in Yaoundé on 16 September 1987 , and grew up having Samuel Etoo as his idol . He started his career for Cameroonian minnows Dragon Club de Yaoundé , being one of the most notable players ever to come out of the club .\nBayern Munich .\nIn May 2006 , he went on trial at Bayern Munich II . Hermann Gerland , the clubs manager , was impressed by Ngwat-Mahops athleticism and assertiveness and recommended his signing . Gerland characterised Ngwat-Mahop as a rough diamond . He made his debut for Bayern Munich II in the opening day of the 2006–07 Regionalliga season . He started the match , but he was brought out in the 62nd minute , in a match that Bayern II lost at home by a 0–2 scoreline by KSV Hessen Kassel . Ngwat-Mahop scored his first goal for Bayern II on 12 August 2006 . It was the sole goal of the match , helping Bayern Munich II overcome the obstacle of Hoffenheim . Two weeks later , he managed to score once again , taking the credit for opening the score in a 4–4 goal glut against SV Elversberg . Ngwat-Mahop continued to play regularly in Bayern II until the end of the season , featuring in 33 matches , out of 34 , all as a starter . He also added five more to his tally , to reach a total of seven goals in the 2006–07 Regionalliga campaign .\nWhile approaching the closing stages of the season , his good performances with Bayern Munich II made Ottmar Hitzfeld , the manager of Bayerns first team , to call him to train with the professional squad . Due to the injuries of a lot of first team players , Ngwat-Mahop was included in Bayerns squad for a match against Borussia Mönchengladbach , although he did not get any playing time in that match . Ngwat-Mahop was also included in Bayerns squad for yet another match , this time against for an away contest against Energie Cottbus . In this match , on 12 May 2007 , he was brought in , to replace Ali Karimi in the 88th minute , wearing number 38 , to make his full professional debut for FC Bayern Munich , in what was an away 0–3 win for his team . That was his sole appearance in the Bundesliga for the 2006–07 season .\nPassport issue .\nOn 29 June 2007 , just before Bayerns Asian tour in Hong-Kong , Ngwat-Mahop found out that he had lost his French passport and started the procedure to get a new one , so he could follow his team in the tour . Upon his request , French authorities found out that Ngwat-Mahops passport had the same number as that of a woman residing in Paris . After the Bayern Munich officials were informed of the passport issue they decided to terminate his contract . After that Ngwat-Mahop started travelling in France and Germany with the German police in his pursuit . Meanwhile , 1 . FC Saarbrücken , having just been relegated from Regionalliga Süd , sued Bayern for an alleged 1 million € losses due to its relegation . 1 . FC Saarbrücken asked FC Bayern Munich II to lose every game that Ngwat-Mahop was included . This would result in Bayerns II relegation instead of Saarbrücken . Saarbrücken finally lost the case in court , a case called ridiculous by Bayerns president Uli Hoeneß .\nRed Bull Salzburg .\nAfter being released by FC Bayern Munich Ngwat-Mahop ended up as a trialist in Red Bull Salzburg . He managed to persuade FC Red Bull Salzburgs manager Giovanni Trapattoni of his football skills and he signed a two-year contract with the Austrian club . After the signing of his contract he was sent to Red Bull Salzburg Juniors to get playing time . There he made his debut in a 5–1 away defeat by FK Austria Wien II .

On 26 October , he netted a goal in the 80th minute of a 2–0 home win against Bad Aussee , to put the game beyond any doubt . In the next match against SK Schwadorf he proved himself a prolific forward by scoring the opening goal of the match , in the first minute , and serving the second to his teammate David Witteveen . Red Bull Salzburg Juniors finally lost the game by a 3–2 scoreline . Ngwat-Mahop continued scoring for his team in 2–1 home win against FK Austria Wien II , by scoring the opening goal of the match . Ngwat-Mahop featured in 13 matches and scored five goals for Red Bull Salzburg Juniors until the winter break . That resulted in him being called to play with FC Red Bull Salzburgs first team . After playing in some friendly matches with Red Bull Salzburg during the winter break , he made his league debut for the club on 23 February 2008 , in a 3–1 away defeat from Austria Wien , as he replaced Alexander Zickler in the 52nd minute . Ngwat-Mahop continued to feature regularly in Red Bull Salzburgs playing squad until the end of the season , although mostly as a substitute . He also managed to score his first goal with Red Bull Salzburg in a 3–0 home win against Sturm Graz . At the end of the season he totalled one goal in 12 appearances . In April 2008 , Ngwat-Mahop signed a contract extension with Red Bull Salzburg until the summer of 2011 .\nNgwat-Mahop contributed greatly in his clubs season opener , as he scored the fourth goal and assisted the sixth , in Red Bull Salzburgs 6–0 home devastation against SV Mattersburg . A few days later he added two more to his tally , as his club won Armenian club Banants by a 7–0 scoreline at home , for the first Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup . He once again scored in his clubs first leg match for the second Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup , against Lithuanian club FK Sūduva . He continued his scoring trends three days later for the first round of the ÖFB-Cup , in a 1–4 away win against Pasching . It took him almost a month to find the net again , as he scored the last goal in his clubs 4–2 home win against Vöcklabrucker for the 2nd round of the ÖFB-Cup . A week later he managed to score the opening goal , in Red Bull Salzburgs 2–2 away draw against Sturm Graz . Until the end of the season he featured regularly in his teams matches , although mostly as a substitute , and only managed to score one more goal in a 4–1 home win against Austria Kärnten .

    "story": "Larry King\nLarry King ( born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger ; November 19 , 1933 – January 23 , 2021 ) was an American television and radio host , whose awards included two Peabodys , an Emmy and ten Cable ACE Awards . Over his career , he hosted over 50,000 interviews .\nKing was a WMBM radio interviewer in the Miami area in the 1950s and 1960s , and gained prominence in 1978 as host of The Larry King Show , an all-night nationwide call-in radio program heard on the Mutual Broadcasting System . From 1985 to 2010 , he hosted the nightly interview television program Larry King Live on CNN . King hosted Larry King Now from 2012 to 2020 , which aired on Hulu , Ora TV , and RT America . He hosted Politicking with Larry King , a weekly political talk show , on the same three channels from 2013 to 2020 . King also appeared in television series and films , usually playing himself .\nEarly life and education .\nKing was born in Brooklyn , on November 19 , 1933 . He was one of two children of Jennie ( Gitlitz ) , a garment worker who was born in Minsk or Vilnius , Russian Empire , and Aaron Zeiger , a restaurant owner and defense-plant worker who was born in Kolomyia , Austria-Hungary , or Pinsk , Russian Empire . His parents were Orthodox Jews who immigrated to the United States from Belarus in the 1930s .\nKing attended Lafayette High School , a public high school in Brooklyn . Kings father died of a heart attack when King was nine years old . This resulted in King , his mother , and brother going on government welfare . King was greatly affected by his fathers death , and subsequently lost interest in his schoolwork .\nAfter graduating from high school , Larry worked to help support his mother . From an early age , he desired to work in radio broadcasting .\nCareer .\nMiami radio and television .\nA CBS staff announcer , whom King met by chance , suggested he go to Florida which was a growing media market with openings for inexperienced broadcasters . King went to Miami , and after initial setbacks , he gained his first job in radio . The manager of a small station , WAHR ( now WMBM ) in Miami Beach , hired him to clean up and perform miscellaneous tasks . When one of the stations announcers abruptly quit , King was put on the air . His first broadcast was on May 1 , 1957 , working as the disc jockey from 9 a.m . to noon . He also did two afternoon newscasts and a sportscast . He was paid $50 a week .\nHe acquired the name Larry King when the general manager claimed that Zeiger was too difficult to remember , so minutes before airtime , Larry chose the surname King , which he got from an advertisement in the Miami Herald for Kings Wholesale Liquor . Within two years , he legally changed his name to Larry King .\nHe began to conduct interviews on a mid-morning show for WIOD , at Pumperniks Restaurant in Miami Beach . He would interview whoever walked in . His first interview was with a waiter at the restaurant . Two days later , singer Bobby Darin , in Miami for a concert that evening , walked into Pumperniks having heard Kings radio show ; Darin became Kings first celebrity interview guest .\nKings Miami radio show brought him local attention . A few years later , in May 1960 , he hosted Miami Undercover , airing Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m . on WPST-TV Channel 10 ( now WPLG ) .\nKing credited his success on local television to the assistance of comedian Jackie Gleason , whose national television variety show was being taped in Miami Beach beginning in 1964 . That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami , King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters Hall of Fame . He did that show and stayed all night with me . We stayed till five in the morning . He didnt like the set , so we broke into the general managers office and changed the set . Gleason changed the set , he changed the lighting , and he became like a mentor of mine .\nDuring this period , WIOD gave King further exposure as a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League , during their 1970 season and most of their 1971 season . However , he was dismissed by both WIOD and television station WTVJ as a late-night radio host and sports commentator as of December 20 , 1971 , when he was arrested after being accused of grand larceny by a former business partner , Louis Wolfson . Other staffers covered the Dolphins games into their 24–3 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl VI . King also lost his weekly column at the Miami Beach Sun newspaper . The charges were dropped . Eventually , King was rehired by WIOD . For several years during the 1970s , he hosted a sports talk-show called Sports-a-la-King that featured guests and callers .\nThe Larry King Show .\nOn January 30 , 1978 , King began broadcasting a nightly coast-to-coast program on the Mutual Broadcasting System , inheriting the talk show slot that had begun with Herb Jepko in 1975 , then followed by Long John Nebel in 1977 , until his illness and death the following year . Kings Mutual show rapidly developed a devoted audience , called King-aholics .\nThe Larry King Show was broadcast live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30 a.m . Eastern Time . King would interview a guest for the first hour , with callers asking questions that continued the interview for the next two hours . At 3 a.m. , the Open Phone America segment began , where he allowed callers to discuss any topic they pleased with him , until the end of the program when he expressed his own political opinions . Many stations in the western time zones carried the Open Phone America portion of the show live , followed by the guest interview on tape delay .\nSome of Kings regular callers used pseudonyms or were given nicknames by King , such as The Numbers Guy , The Chair , The Portland Laugher , The Miami Derelict , and The Scandal Scooper . At the beginning , the show had 28 affiliates , though the number was eventually above 500 . King hosted the show until stepping down in 1994 . King occasionally entertained the audience by telling amusing stories from his youth or early broadcasting career .\nFor its final year , the show was moved to afternoons . After King stepped down , Mutual gave the afternoon slot to David Brenner and Mutuals affiliates were given the option of carrying the audio of Kings new CNN evening television program . After Westwood One dissolved Mutual in 1999 , the radio simulcast of the CNN show continued until December 31 , 2009 .\nLarry King Live .\nLarry King Live began on CNN in June 1985 . On the show , King hosted a broad range of guests , from figures such as UFO conspiracy theorists and alleged psychics , to prominent politicians and entertainment industry figures , often doing their first or only interview on breaking news stories on his show . After broadcasting his CNN show from 9 to 10 p.m. , King then traveled to the studios of the Mutual Broadcasting System to do his radio show , when both shows still aired .\nTwo of his best-remembered interviews involved political figures . In 1992 , billionaire Ross Perot announced his presidential bid on the show . In 1993 , a debate between Al Gore and Perot became CNNs most-watched segment until 2015 .\nUnlike many interviewers , King had a direct , non-confrontational approach . His reputation for asking easy , open-ended questions made him attractive to important figures who wanted to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics . King said that when interviewing authors , he did not read their books in advance , so that he would not know more than his audience . Throughout his career , King interviewed many of the leading figures of his time . According to CNN , King conducted more than 30,000 interviews in his career .\nKing also wrote a regular newspaper column in USA Today for almost 20 years , from shortly after that first national newspapers debut in Baltimore-Washington in 1982 until September 2001 . The column consisted of short plugs , superlatives and dropped names but was dropped when the newspaper redesigned its Life section . The column was resurrected in blog form in November 2008 and on Twitter in April 2009 .\nDuring his career , he did more than 60,000 interviews . CNNs Larry King Live became the longest-running television show hosted by the same person , on the same network and in the same time slot , and was recognized for it by the Guinness Book of World Records . He retired in 2010 after taping 6,000 episodes of the show .\nDeparture .\nOn June 29 , 2010 , King announced that after 25 years , he would be stepping down as the shows host . However , he stated that he would remain with CNN to host occasional specials . The announcement came in the wake of speculation that CNN had approached Piers Morgan , the British television personality and journalist , as Kings primetime replacement , which was confirmed that September .\nThe final edition of Larry King Live aired on December 16 , 2010 . The show concluded with his last thoughts and a thank you to his audience for watching and supporting him over the years . The concluding words of Larry King on the show were , I.. . I , I dont know what to say except to you , my audience , thank you . And instead of goodbye , how about so long .\nOn February 17 , 2012 , CNN announced that he would no longer host specials .\nShows on Ora TV .\nIn March 2012 , King co-founded Ora TV , a production company , with Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim . On January 16 , 2013 , Ora TV celebrated their 100th episode of Larry King Now . In September 2017 , King stated that he had no intention of ever retiring and expected to host his programs until he died .\nOra TV signed a multi-year deal with Hulu to exclusively carry Kings new talk-oriented web series , Larry King Now , beginning July 17 . On October 23 , 2012 , King hosted the third-party presidential debate on Ora TV , featuring Jill Stein , Rocky Anderson , Virgil Goode , and Gary Johnson .\nIn May 2013 , the Russian-owned RT America network announced that they struck a deal with Ora TV to host the Larry King Now show on its network . King said in an advertisement on RT America : I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power , instead of speaking on their behalf . The show continued to be available on Hulu.com and Ora.tv .\nWhen criticized for doing business with a Russian-owned TV network in 2014 , King responded , I dont work for RT , commenting that his podcasts , Larry King Now and Politicking , are licensed for a fee to RT America by New York-based Ora TV . It’s a deal made between the companies .. . They just license our shows . If they took something out , I would never do it . It would be bad if they tried to edit out things . I wouldn’t put up with it .\nOther ventures .\nKing remained active as a writer and television personality thereafter .\nKing guest starred in episodes of Arthur , 30 Rock and Gravity Falls , had cameos in Ghostbusters and Bee Movie , and voiced Doris the Ugly Stepsister in Shrek 2 and its sequels .

The whole concept has changed .\nAfter 2011 , he also made various television infomercials , often appearing as a host discussing products like Omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplement OmegaXL with guests , in an interview style reminiscent of his past television programs .\nProPublica reported that in 2019 King had been manipulated into starring in a fake interview with a Russian journalist containing disinformation about Chinese dissident Guo Wengui , which was subsequently spread by Chinese government associated social media accounts .\nCharitable works .\nFollowing his 1987 heart attack , King founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation , a non-profit organization which paid for life-saving cardiac procedures for people who otherwise would not be able to afford them .\nOn August 30 , 2010 , King served as the host of Chabads 30th annual To Life telethon , in Los Angeles .\nHe donated to the Beverly Hills 9/11 Memorial Garden , and his name is on the monument .\nPersonal life .\nKing was married eight times , to seven women .

    "story": "Vindobona ( train )\nThe Vindobona is an international named passenger train which began service in 1957 between Berlin and Vienna via Dresden and Prague . In later years the route was extended to run from Hamburg via Berlin , Dresden , Prague , Brno and Vienna to Villach . It was named after the ancient settlement of Vindobona on the site of the modern city of Vienna . Labelled as a EuroCity train connection from 1993 , services discontinued in 2014 .\nSince December 2018 there is a daily direct Intercity-Express high-speed train between Vienna and Berlin via Linz , Passau and Erfurt . The name Vindobona is now used for Railjet trains between Prague and Graz via Vienna operated by České dráhy and Austrian Federal Railways ( ÖBB ) . This route has been again extended to Berlin from mid-2020 .\nRoute .\nThe service began on 13 January 1957 using diesel multiple units classified as Fernschnellzug ( FDt 50/51 ) running from Friedrichstraße station in East Berlin via Berlin Ostbahnhof , Elsterwerda , Dresden Hauptbahnhof , Prague hlavní nádraží and České Velenice/Gmünd to Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof . The FDt trains had already begun running between Berlin and Prague in December 1950 , including a through coach connection to Vienna . In 1959 the connection was upgraded as Expresszug ( Ext 54/55 ) .\nFrom December 1957 the railcars had first and second class sections . The participating companies Deutsche Reichsbahn ( DR ) , Československé státní dráhy ( ČSD ) and Österreichische Bundesbahnen ( ÖBB ) operated one train pair daily , meeting in Czechoslovakia . The service was used primarily by West Berliners , diplomats and Scandinavians in transit through East Germany , connecting from the night trains from Copenhagen ( Ostsee-Express ) and Stockholm ( Saßnitz-Express ) via train ferry from Warnemünde and Sassnitz resp. , and shuttle trains from Zoologischer Garten station in West Berlin . In the dining car , passengers could pay using Deutschmark , East German mark , Czechoslovak koruna , and Austrian schilling .\nIn Czechoslovakia trains originally ran on the historic Emperor Franz Joseph Railway line via Tábor to the border with Austria at České Velenice , later rerouted via the first Czech railway corridor to Brno and Břeclav . In the period of Normalization from 1969 onwards , domestic travel within Czechoslovakia was for some years completely forbidden , occasionally restricted to journeys between Děčín and Tábor . The original journey via Tábor took over 12 hours to complete from Berlin to Vienna . Later , the mainline via Brno became faster , and the train was rerouted , initially via Havlíčkův Brod and later via Pardubice and Česká Třebová along the Czech international corridor , shortening the journey to 9 hours . In 1975 , Wien Mitte station became the terminus due to construction at the Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof .\nRolling stock .\nRolling stock was alternately supplied by the railway companies for a period of two years : The DR used a refurbished pre-war DRG Class SVT 137 unit until 1960 , succeeded by MÁVAG 495.0 and 498.0 railcars operated by ČSD , and ÖBB 5145 ( Blue Lightning ) DMUs from 1962 to 1964 . In 1966 DR introduced its newly engineered VT 18.16 diesel-hydraulic express railcars , apparently rivalling with the West German DB Class VT 11.5 . Renamed Class 175 in 1970 , these prestigious trainsets became a flagship in the range of DR services . From 1969 to 1972 , ČSD operated its recently developed M 296.1 railcars with a top speed of .\nThe Vindobona trains continued to be operated by DMUs until it became evident that they were no longer able to cope in terms of capacity . In 1979 they were replaced by a composition comprising an electric locomotive coupled with individual carriages . The trains then ran as Durchgangszug ( D 275/276 ) and from 1986 to 1988 services were united with the Hungaria Interexpress train to Bratislava and Budapest , including Hungarian State Railways ( MÁV ) railcars and Yugoslav Railways ( JŽ ) through coaches to Belgrade . In later years trains were hauled by DB Class 101 , ČD Class 371 and Class 380 , and ÖBB 1216 ( EuroSprinter ) locomotives .\nEuroCity .\nAfter the Revolutions of 1989 and the fall of the Iron Curtain , the railway connection gained new significance . A EuroCity ( EC ) service from Hamburg to Prague was already inaugurated in 1992 and in the following year , the Vindobona train also became categorised as EC 172/173 . The DR operations were taken over by Deutsche Bahn AG by 1994 . With the opening of Berlin Hauptbahnhof on 28 May 2006 , trains passed through Berlin via the new North–South mainline . As of 2010 , trains ran from Villach Hauptbahnhof to Hamburg-Altona via Klagenfurt , Vienna , Brno , Prague , Dresden and Berlin in about 16 hours .\nAs of 14 December 2014 , the EC 172/173 Vindobona was replaced by the EC 172/173 Porta Bohemica from Hamburg-Altona to Budapest Keleti , connecting in Prague hlavní nádraží to a Railjet train service via the newly built Wien Hauptbahnhof to Graz Hauptbahnhof and vice versa . Since December 2018 there is a daily direct DB Intercity Express high-speed train ( ICE 92/93 Berolina ) from Berlin to Vienna via Erfurt , Nuremberg and Linz , as well as a ÖBB Nightjet train with sleeping car ( NJ 456/457 ) via Wrocław , Bohumín and Břeclav . The name Vindobona has then been reused for the Railjet line connecting Prague , Vienna and Graz ( RJ 256/257 ) . After delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic , this route has been extended to Berlin from 14 June 2020 ; thus , the historic train connection is reestablished .",

In 2007 Fuglsang moved to Italy in order to focus on riding his bike . It was a hard year for Fuglsang as he had no friends in the area and had no visits from his family . Despite being alone it allowed him to focus on his mountain bike career . The biggest event of his 2007 season came in September where he would ride the Under-23 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships . His biggest rival at the event was Swiss rider Nino Schurter . They had competed in GP Tell just weeks before the event where Fuglsang finished 3rd and Schurter 8th . However , when they approached the final of the race Schurter was in the lead but Fuglsang was closing in on the Swiss and overtook him on the final lap on an uphill section . Fuglsang could cross the line as Under-23 World Champion . After the event Fuglsang got tattooed the rainbow stripes on his right arm . The following year Fuglsang decided to focus more on road racing , however he would still ride mountain bikes races . After having finished 2nd overall with teammate Roal Paulissen in Cape Epic in 2007 , he came back with Paulissen again the following year and claimed the overall win . He was leading the 2008 edition of Danmark Rundt heading into the last stage . He had been in contact with , and the deal was finally signed the day before he won Danmark Rundt . Despite having signed the contract , Fuglsangs manager wanted him to wait as his market value could inflate if he won Danmark Rundt which he did the following day .\nTeam Saxo Bank ( 2009–2010 ) .\nFuglsang rode his first World Tour season in 2009 , riding for which was led by Bjarne Riis . He had a great first year with finishing 6th overall in the Volta a Catalunya and Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré . Fuglsang won his second Danmark Rundt in August and had also won Tour of Slovenia one and a half months previous . He rode his first Grand Tour in August and September when he started in the Vuelta a España . He crashed in the first couple stages when he rode into the back of a tanker due to limiting road control . Later in the season he finished 2nd in the Italian classic Giro dellEmilia .\nThe following year would be a controversial year for . It was uncertain whether the team would continue in 2011 due to a lack of sponsorship interest . Fuglsang wanted to stay at the team but got a great offer from which was enough to persuade him . In June Fuglsang finished 3rd overall in the Tour de Suisse and won the Danish National Time Trial Championships for the first time in his career . In July 2010 , Fuglsang started his first ever Tour de France . Despite most of the team set to leave in the 2011 season , Riis managed the team well and Andy Schleck would end up winning the race due to Alberto Contadors Clenbuterol case . Following the Tour de France , Fuglsang won his third Danmark Rundt in a row . In his last race for , Fuglsang finished 4th in Giro di Lombardia after beating Vincenzo Nibali in a sprint .\nLeopard Trek ( 2011–12 ) .\n2011 : Grand Tour leaders jersey .\nIn the 2011 season , Fuglsang was riding for the new Luxembourgish team funded by Flavio Becca . Fuglsang had a mixed start to his season with finishing 11th at Tour of Oman before abandoning at Paris-Nice . He finished 3rd on the Time trial at Critérium International and 4th on the Time trial at Tour of the Basque Country . He had to wait until the middle of April to get his first top result of the season . Fuglsang rode Amstel Gold Race where an attack on Cauberg saw Philippe Gilbert take the victory . Fuglsang could not quite follow the pace but managed to finish 4th just 5 seconds behind Gilbert . It was decided from the start of the season that Fuglsang would ride the Tour de France as a domestique for the Schleck brothers , and he showcased great form in his final stage race before the Tour . Delivering yet another great Time trial , Fuglsang finished 4th overall in the Tour de Suisse . In June he also finished 2nd in the Danish National Time Trial Championships . Arriving at the 2011 Tour de France , was one of the favorites to take the win . After the first 8 stages , Fränk Schleck was 3rd , Fuglsang 5th and Andy Schleck 6th . Later in the race Fuglsang dropped out of the top 10 but the Tour was still a success with Andy Schleck taking a stage win and 2nd overall , and Fränk Schleck taking 3rd overall . Fuglsang participated in the Vuelta a España where won the Opening Team Time Trial with Fuglsang crossing the line in first position . This meant that Fuglsang would wear the Red Leaders jersey on the following stage . Fuglsang was just the second Danish rider to wear the jersey , which was previously worn by Lars Michaelsen . His teammate Daniele Bennati took over the lead on stage 2 . Fuglsang put in another great Time trial on stage 10 and finished 6th which moved him up to 2nd overall . However , later in the race he would drop to 11th overall .\n2012 : Excluded from World Tour races .\nIn 2012 , Fuglsang remained with the Schleck brothers , as the team became . He was slated to be his teams leader in the 2012 Giro dItalia , but had to withdraw due to knee problems and was replaced with Fränk Schleck . Fuglsang later won the Tour de Luxembourg , taking the overall classification jersey in the queen stage to Differdange and then defending his lead with the help of his team for the fourth and final stage in Luxembourg City . The last stage had to be shortened by by the organizers due to heavy rain . He was then excluded from the Tour de France by the team management after he had criticized them . He stated that he wanted to race for another squad in the next season since he was not happy with the way things were going within the team . In his book released in collaboration with Rasmus Staghøj in 2018 , Fuglsang wrote that there was no real structure around the team . was the result of a merger between the two teams : and . During races and training camps the team was often split and racing as two teams , not one . Having phoned the general manager Johan Bruyneel , it was confirmed that Fuglsang was not riding any more World Tour races in 2012 . As Fuglsang had just won the Danish National Time Trial Championships for the second time in his career , he went to Austria to ride the Tour of Austria . Fuglsang won stage 4 and the overall race ahead of Steve Morabito of who finished one minute and 24 seconds behind the Dane .\nAstana ( 2013–present ) .\n2013 : 7th overall at the Tour de France .\nFuglsang left at the end of the 2012 season , and joined on an initial three-year contract from the 2013 season onwards . In the 2013 Tour de France , Fuglsang was the team leader of Astana . As Dan Martin attacked on stage 9 , Fuglsang saw it as a perfect opportunity to gain time on the other contenders , and attacked with Martin . They got a gap straight away , and started to work together . Inside the final kilometers it was clear to see that the bunch could not catch them . Fuglsang led out the sprint from the front , and as Martin attacked , he could not follow and had to settle with 2nd place . It was not until stage 13 that Fuglsang again was on the offence , when attacked during sections of crosswinds . Fuglsang was the only rider from Astana in the break and finished 4th on the stage , advancing to 6th overall . His efforts on that stage gained praise from his team-mates and staff . From then on , Fuglsang battled with Dutch rider Bauke Mollema for the 6th place . Eventually he ended up finishing 7th overall , after a good performance in the mountains and the time trials . Later that year he helped team-mate Vincenzo Nibali to the Italians second place at the Vuelta a España .\n2014 : Helping Vincenzo Nibali win the Tour de France .\nThroughout the spring of the 2014 season , Fuglsang showed he had consistent form at the major World Tour stage races . He was set to help Vincenzo Nibali win the 2014 Tour de France . However the Italian rider showed no results before the Critérium du Dauphiné . On the final stage of the one-week stage race , Nibali attacked but was later dropped due to his efforts . Fuglsang was then ordered to pace Nibali up the final climb , but when the pace kept getting slower , Fuglsang was then finally ordered to ride his own chance . This sparked a lot of controversy at Astana since the leader for the Tour de France , was weaker than his domestique .\nOn stage 2 of Tour de France , Fuglsang attacked a few times until Nibali managed to get away and win the stage in the end . Just a few days later , Fuglsang and Nibali were riding together on the cobblestone stage and dropped all the other contenders . However , on the final sector of cobblestones , Nibali was once again having problems , and could not close the gap to Lars Boom who rode away in the distance and won the stage . Fuglsang had to slow down his pace in order to get Nibali to the finish line , and once again Fuglsang finished second on a Tour de France stage . After the stage , Nibali was first overall and Fuglsang second overall . However , on the first climbing stage , Fuglsang showed weakness and dropped to fourth overall . On the following stages he dropped out of the top 10 , and lost even more time on stage 13 when he hit a bottle on the downhill to the final climb . The remainder of the race became a challenge for Fuglsang who finished 36th overall .\n2015 : Hunting a Tour de France stage win .\nHaving finished 7th overall at both the Tour of Oman and Paris-Nice , Fuglsang also cracked the top ten in two of the three Ardennes Classics , finishing eighth at La Flèche Wallonne and ninth at Liège–Bastogne–Liège . His main goal of the season was to help Vincenzo Nibali defend his 2014 Tour de France title . However already on the first mountain stage , Nibali looked vulnerable and Fuglsang was awarded his own chance by the Astana team . Fuglsang did a great final climb but only finished 13th because of acting as domestique to Nibali . The Astana team then said they were going to focus on Fuglsang for the remainder of the race . However , on the following day Fuglsang lost a lot of time , with Nibali only losing a minute . The final day in the Pyrenees saw the race heading up Plateau de Beille , and Fuglsang was in a 22-man breakaway . As the group was heading up the final climb , more riders were dropped from the group and Joaquim Rodríguez attacked with no one able to match the Spaniards pace . Rodríguez won the stage with 1:12 down to Jakob Fuglsang who arrived at the soaking wet finish line in 2nd place . In probably his last chance for a stage win , Fuglsang went all in on stage 18 of the race . He was once again a part of a huge group which became smaller as it approached the Col du Glandon . It was clear that Fuglsang had a shot at winning the stage , but he was taken down by a motorbike which was about to pass the group . This ended his chances of a stage win and the driver of the motorbike was later ejected from the race .\n2016 : Olympic Silver medal .\nAs the final preparation race for the 2016 Giro dItalia , Fuglsang rode the Giro del Trentino . Fuglsang finished the race in 3rd overall with team-mate Tanel Kangert finishing 2nd overall . The team leader for the Giro , Nibali only finished 21st overall . On the first decisive day in the Giro dItalia , Nibali attacked but was again dropped after his attack . Fuglsang followed the other contenders and even attacked inside the final kilometer and finished 2nd , and also advancing to 2nd place overall . Two days later Fuglsang lost time to the other contenders as he punctured on a gravel sector . After making a comeback in the final week of the race , Nibali ended up winning the Giro dItalia with help from Fuglsang and his Astana team . At the Tour de France , Fuglsang was missing form but attacked on the final mountain stage but had no luck in going for the win on that stage . The team leader of Astana , Fabio Aru also cracked on that stage which meant Astana left the Tour de France empty handed .\nAt the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Fuglsang was in the chaser group descending the final climb , when two of the main-favorites Vincenzo Nibali and Richie Porte crashed . Going into the final kilometers Rafał Majka was alone in the front but an attack from Fuglsang and Greg Van Avermaet meant that a trio had formed inside the last 1.5 kilometers . Going into the sprint Fuglsang was leading the trio inside the final kilometer , with Van Avermaet opening the sprint inside the final 200 meters beating Fuglsang at the line . This meant a gold medal for Van Avermaet , silver for Fuglsang and bronze for Majka . Following his silver medal in the Olympic Games , Fuglsang started showing more aggressive racing for the following seasons .\n2017 : Winning the Critérium du Dauphiné .\nIn June 2017 Fuglsang rode the Critérium du Dauphiné alongside Italian team-mate Fabio Aru as the leader . On stage 6 , Fuglsang attacked on Mont du Chat , and got a gap on the general classification contenders . However , Aru also attacked a few minutes after which sparked a lot of debate since his team-mate was at the front of the race . Aru reached the top of the climb first with Chris Froome , Richie Porte and Jakob Fuglsang 15 seconds behind . On the downhill Aru was caught and the quartet reached the finish line together with Fuglsang winning the stage . This was a huge relief for Fuglsang as this was his first win in almost five years , and his first world tour win and first win in Astana colors . On the following day , Fuglsang finished 7th and was the only rider who could keep up with Porte , which meant he maintained his 3rd place in the general classification . On the last day of the race , Fuglsang showed a strong performance . Froome and did everything to win and attacked early on the stage which cracked race leader Porte . It was clear to see that Froome were doing everything he could to boost his gap down to Porte . However he had used too much energy on the stage , and cracked up the final climb . Dan Martin then attacked and Fuglsang attacked a little later , and managed to chase down Martin , and blast pass him as Fuglsang won his second stage in just three days . Not only did he win the stage but Fuglsang also won the overall race , which was the biggest win of his career .\nGoing into the Tour de France , Fuglsang was now considered one of the top favorites . On the first mountain stage , Fuglsang lost over a minute and started doubting if he had lost the form he had one month earlier . He bounced back on the queen stage of the race on stage 9 that included Mont du Chat which Fuglsang had ridden one month previous at the Critérium du Dauphiné . Having a great knowledge of the climb , Fuglsang attacked just as in the Dauphiné but once again an attack was made by team-mate Fabio Aru . This sparked a lot of debate as the Italian attacked his own team-mate and attacked when Chris Froome had a mechanical . Eventually Fuglsang reached the downhill with the other general classification contenders as they hunted down Warren Barguil for the stage win . Fuglsang attacked inside the final 500 meters but was chased down by Rigoberto Urán and lost his chance for the stage win . Despite losing the stage win , Fuglsang had gained the 5th place overall . Days later he went down in a crash in the feeding zone and suffered fractures to his elbow and wrist . He abandoned the race on stage 13 .

He scored another top 10 finish one week later at the Vuelta a Murcia , placing 6th . In the middle of February , Fuglsang rode the Vuelta a Andalucía , where he was 4th overall . Fuglsang arrived at Paris-Nice with hopes of riding for the general classification , however he was involved in a crash on the first stage , and lost time as he did the previous year . As his team-mate Luis León Sánchez was in the leaders jersey , Fuglsang helped his team-mate throughout the race , but when Sanchez cracked on stage 7 , Fuglsang got his own chance with a few kilometers to go , and finished 9th on the stage .\nHis next attempt to improve form after the opening stage races of the year was the first altitude training camp for the Tour de France . His first races back after his training camp were the Ardennes Classics , where he managed to finish 8th at Amstel Gold Race and 10th at Liège–Bastogne–Liège , as his best results . Fuglsang was ready to race again only two days later , when he started Tour de Romandie . After a disappointing time trial on stage 3 , he attacked on the downhill of the last climb on stage 4 , and took his first win of the season . He finished inside the bunch on the final stage , which meant he finished 4th overall .\nFuglsang then went to altitude training camp once again to focus for the Tour de France . On 1 June , Fuglsang published his first book which he made in collaboration with Rasmus Staghøj .\nHis last race before La Grand Boucle was Tour de Suisse . Fuglsang and his Astana team-mates got off to a very bad start to the race , only finishing 20th in the team time trial on stage 1 . Fuglsang recovered and finished 2nd on the queen stage , and delivered the best time trial of the general classification contenders on stage 9 , advancing Fuglsang to 2nd place overall . When Fuglsang arrived at the Tour de France however , his first week was full of chaotic moments . He was ninth on the first stage but with one man down on stage 3 , Astana almost lost a minute in the team time trial . As the race hit the region of Brittany , Fuglsang was dealing with crashes and mechanical problems . He managed to overcome the problems and advanced to 7th place in the general classification after the cobbled classics stage , a stage in which Fuglsang attacked but had no luck of getting away from the bunch . As the race hit the Alps , Fuglsang was near top 3 overall , but cracked on stage 11 and dropped to 12th overall . For the rest of the race , he was struggling to keep up with the other general classification contenders and finished 12th overall in Paris .\nFuglsang returned to racing after 2.5 weeks at Arctic Race of Norway where he was in the breakaway on stage 2 , and finished 9th on the stage . At the Canadian World Tour classic Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal , Fuglsang was in a late breakaway with Tim Wellens ( ) and James Knox ( ) , but was brought back by the bunch with 6.2 kilometers to go .

Izaguirre took the race lead on the final day from Emanuel Buchmann , who would also make an error in the final turn . The German cyclist took the wrong turn which caused him to lose several seconds and ultimately his podium place . However the race jury decided to reinstate Buchmann on the podium , which dropped Fuglsang down to 4th place overall . Fuglsang found the decision ridiculous and said he had never seen anything like it before .\nFuglsang rode an amazing Ardennes Classics week where he finished on the podium in all three races . At Amstel Gold Race , Fuglsang rode away with Alaphilippe , and they looked to fight out the win , however they slowed down drastically in the final kilometre which allowed the chasing group to bridge the gap to the leaders . Ultimately Fuglsang finished 3rd , and Alaphilippe 4th . At La Flèche Wallonne Fuglsang attacked on Muur de Huy , and only Alaphilippe could follow . It was once again a battle between Fuglsang and Alaphilippe as the Frenchman outsprinted the Dane . At the final classics race Liège–Bastogne–Liège , Fuglsang was the favourite , and he delivered despite huge pressure . He attacked in the final stages and dropped everyone , however he nearly crashed with 3 kilometres to go , but a miraculous save from Fuglsang secured him his first win in a monument classics . At his final race before the Tour de France , Fuglsang finished 3rd on Stage 2 at Critérium du Dauphiné , and proved he was one of the strongest candidates for the overall Tour win . He would take the yellow jersey on the penultimate day after attacking and dropping Adam Yates . His nearest rival for the overall win , Yates abandoned the race due to a fever . Thibaut Pinot tried an attack inside the final two kilometres , however Fuglsang quickly closed it down , and won his second Critérium du Dauphiné .\n2020 : Second monument win .\nFuglsang started his 2020 campaign with a repeat victory in the Spanish stage race Vuelta a Andalucía . Aside from winning the general classification , Fuglsang also won two stages and finished 2nd on two other occasions . After the racing resumed in August , Fuglsang started with a 5th-place finish in the Italian neo-classic Strade Bianche , and a week later , he managed to come 2nd in the Tour de Pologne . On 15 August he took his first victory after the lockdown as he soloed his way to victory in the Italian monument race Il Lombardia . The victory in Lombardy was Fuglsangs second monument win , and it also marked the first time a Danish cyclist won the race .\nIn the 2020 UCI Road World Championships , Fuglsang finished 5th in the road race and thus improved on his previous best result , a 12th-place finish from the road race in 2019 . Fuglsang came into the road race as a top favourite and rode a tactical race until the last ascent up Cima Gallisterna , where he came up just short against his classics rival and the eventual race winner Julian Alaphilippe . Alaphilippe escaped on the last climb and soloed to victory , while Fuglsang lost the sprint for silver and bronze medals in a chase group . He contested the Giro dItalia , finishing sixth overall – his best Grand Tour finish to that point .\nPersonal life .\nJakob Fuglsang lives in Monaco with his wife Loulou , whom he married in 2015 . The couple have a daughter , Jamie Lou who was born in June 2017 . Before moving to Monaco , Jakob and Loulou lived in Luxembourg where Fuglsang trained together with Andy Schleck and Fränk Schleck . His wife Loulou gave up her own chances of a modelling career in order to support Fuglsang in his sporting career .\nMajor results .\nRoad .\n- 2007\n- 2008\n- 2009\n- 2010\n- 2011\n- 2012\n- 2013\n- 2014\n- 2015\n- 2016\n- 2017\n- 2018\n- 2019\n- 2020\n- 2021\nMountain Bike .\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2007\n- 2008\nExternal links .\n- Palmares on CyclingBase ( French )",

    "story": "George Poindexter\nGeorge Poindexter ( April 19 , 1779 − September 5 , 1853 ) was an American politician , lawyer and judge from Mississippi . Born in Virginia , he moved to the Mississippi Territory in 1802 . He served as United States Representative from the newly admitted state , was elected as Governor ( 1820–1822 ) , and served as a United States Senator .\nEarly life .\nPoindexter was born in Louisa County , Virginia in 1779 . He was the son of Thomas Poindexter and Lucy ( Jones ) Poindexter ; the Poindexters were a large Virginia family of French Huguenot and English ancestry . Poindexter received a sporadic education , primarily from studying under the tutelage of two of his brothers . He was orphaned after his father died when Poindexter was 17 ; Poindexter inherited two slaves and a share of his fathers land , and resided with an older brother until he came of age . The Poindexter family of Virginia made frequent use of the names George , Thomas , and John ; as a result , their genealogy is difficult to trace . He may have been the uncle of Ohio abolitionist preacher James Preston Poindexter , whose father was Joseph Poindexter , a journalist at the Richmond Enquirer .\nThe exact details of Poindexters legal studies are not known , but according to family tradition , Poindexter studied under practicing attorneys , first in Kentucky , and later in Richmond . He was admitted to the bar in 1800 and began to practice in Milton , an Albemarle County town along the Rivanna River which no longer exists .\nMove to Mississippi .\nAfter moving to the Mississippi Territory in 1802 , Poindexter set up his law practice in Natchez . He soon became a friend of Governor William C . C . Claiborne , and a leader in the local Democratic-Republican Party . As a result , in 1803 , he was appointed Attorney General of the Territory ; he served until 1807 , when he took up his duties as a member of the Territorial House of Representatives , to which he had been elected in 1806 . ( He had been an unsuccessful candidate for the legislature in 1804. )\nDuring Mississippis early years , nearby areas were under Spanish control . When tensions rose over Mississippis expansion , and the Spanish threatened an attack , residents of Adams County formed a militia ; Poindexter was one of the main organizers of a company in Natchez , the Mississippi Blues , and he was elected commander with the rank of captain . No attack from Spain materialized , and the militia soon disbanded .\nWhen former U.S . Vice President Aaron Burr appeared in Mississippi while traveling south as part of the Burr conspiracy in 1807 , acting Governor Cowles Mead declared martial law , appointed Poindexter and William B . Shields as aides-de-camp on his military staff , and sent them to interview Burr and determine his intentions . When Burr was arrested , Poindexter conducted the prosecution until Burrs escape from custody . After Burr escaped , Governor Robert Williams returned from vacation at his home in North Carolina to personally take control of the situation ; he criticized Mead and fired the militia officers Mead had appointed , including Poindexter .\nTerritorial delegate to Congress .\nPoindexter was elected as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives from the Mississippi Territory ; he served in the 10th , 11th and 12th Congresses ( 1807 to 1813 ) . As a delegate , Poindexter concentrated his efforts largely on questions germane to Mississippi , such as federal patronage , as well as advocating for Mississippis admission to the Union . Poindexter also worked to resolve and standardize land titles in Mississippi , where residents possessed deeds and grants from Spain , France , England , and the United States , due to the number of times the area had changed hands . He also opposed those who claimed the Yazoo lands , but in 1810 the United States Supreme Courts ruling in Fletcher v . Peck , resolved the claims in their favor .\nBefore leaving for Washington , DC to begin his duties , Mead informed Poindexter of disparaging comments Williams had made to Mead about Poindexter following Burrs escape . Poindexter responded by challenging Williams to a duel ; Williams replied that he would admit to any comment Mead attributed to him , but that he would not involve either his public or private character with such a man . Poindexter responded by writing letters to the editor that made it appear that he had been wronged by Williams and was unable to obtain satisfaction , which had the effect of making Williams appear cowardly in the eyes of his constituents .\nPoindexter was in Richmond in October 1807 to testify at Burrs treason trial ; his testimony suggested that Burrs arrest had been based on flimsy evidence , which probably played a part in Burrs acquittal .\nIn 1811 , Poindexters outspoken opposition to the Federalist Party resulted in a duel with wealthy merchant and planter Abijah Hunt . Poindexter killed Hunt , but afterwards Poindexters political opponents alleged that he had broken the code duello by firing at Hunt prematurely .\nJudgeship and the House of Representatives .\nPoindexter did not run for reelection in 1812 ; after his final term in Congress ended he was appointed as federal Judge for the Mississippi Territory , and he served from 1813 to 1817 . Poindexter also served as a volunteer aide to William Carroll as Carroll commanded a division of Tennessee militia at the War of 1812s decisive 1814 Battle of New Orleans .\nPoindexter was chairman of the committee that was appointed to draft a constitution for the new state of Mississippi . After its admission in 1817 , he was elected to be the states first representative in Congress . He served in the 15th Congress from 1817 to 1819 , when he chaired the Committee on Public Lands .\nAfter that , he was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S . House of Representatives in 1820 to the 17th Congress and in 1822 to the 18th Congress .\nGovernor of Mississippi .\nIn 1819 Poindexter was elected the second Governor of Mississippi by a large margin , winning more than 60% of the vote . He served from 1820 to 1822 . During his time in office he oversaw a reorganization of the militia , the state created its first free public schools , state courts were reorganized , and Jackson was selected as the site for the state capital .\nUnited States Senate .\nPoindexter was appointed to the United States Senate in 1830 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Robert H . Adams , and served from 1830 to 1835 . Soon after his appointment , he learned of the financial distress of Martha Jefferson Randolph , whose father Thomas Jefferson had left an estate heavily encumbered by debt . Poindexter introduced a bill to grant Randolph 50,000 acres in Virginia , with the idea she could sell the land to raise money to live on . The bill failed to pass the Senate , and was rejected by the two Virginia senators in 1831 .\nPoindexter served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims in the 22nd Congress from 1831 to 1833 , of the Committee on Public Lands in the 23rd Congress from 1833 to 1835 and was President pro tempore of the Senate from June to November 1834 .\nPoindexters tenure as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims had been considered moderately controversial at the time , as he had espoused some views that could be considered Socialist , regarding government repossession of land . Poindexter was thought to have made these claims to support President Andrew Jacksons fight with the Second Bank of the United States . He was a supporter of President Jackson , and had defended him against calls for censure stemming from the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident , but had slowly become less happy with the Presidents policies .\nIn 1834 Poindexter had his home in Washington , D.C . painted by Richard Lawrence . A deranged man , Lawrence came to believe that he was the ruler of England and the United States , and that Jackson was a usurper . In January 1835 Lawrence made two attempts to shoot at Jackson using two separate pistols , both of which misfired . The assassination attempt occurred as Jackson was attending a memorial service for a Congressman at the U.S . capitol , and the first attempt to assassinate a president . Jackson accused various political enemies of being behind Lawrences actions , including Poindexter , who denied any connection . Poindexter also took issue with Vice President Martin Van Burens support of Jackson during the debate over the Bank , and made explicit threats that caused Van Buren to carry pistols for self-defense when presiding over the Senate . The accusations about Lawrence followed Poindexter back to Mississippi , and he was unsuccessful in running for a second term . Poindexter returned to Mississippi embittered by these issues .\nRetirement from politics .\nIn 1835 , Poindexter moved to Kentucky , where he continued practicing law in Lexington . He later moved back to Jackson , Mississippi and continued his law practice until his death there on September 5 , 1853 . He was interred in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson .\nFamily .\nIn 1804 Poindexter married Lydia Carter ( 1789–1824 ) , the daughter of a prominent Natchez businessman and plantation owner . They had two sons , George Littleton ( or Lytleton ) and Albert Gallatin . They divorced after Poindexter publicly accused his wife of infidelity and claimed that their second child , whom he disavowed , was the product of an extramarital affair between his wife and their neighbor . In 1820 Lydia Carter Poindexter married Reverend Lewis Williams and moved to Brimfield , Massachusetts . Her sons remained with her ; Poindexter provided for the support of George , but disavowed Albert and refused to provide for him .\nIn 1816 Poindexter married Agatha Ball Chinn ( 1794–1822 ) . They had one son who died of yellow fever as a child while Poindexter was Governor , and Agatha Poindexter died soon afterwards .\nHe was said to have a serious , potentially non-consensual , liaison with a woman who was a slave .\nWhen several years before , Representative Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky was criticized for his common-law marriage with his slave Julia Chinn , he said , Unlike Jefferson , Clay , Poindexter and others , I married my wife under the eyes of God , and apparently He has found no objections .\nHistorian Burke has written ,\nDuring slavery times , there was no particular stigma attached to the fact that many southern plantation owners , along with their white overseers , often fathered mulatto children born of black slave women . As long as the white father denied the facts , the customs that created miscegenation were usually overlooked by Southern society .\nJohnson violated the norms by acknowledging Chinn as his wife and their daughters as his , plus trying to introduce his daughters to polite society .",

He was the chief financial officer of British banking group Prudential from 2007 to 2009 , and then its CEO until 2015 . In 2019 , Thiam became a member of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .\nBorn into a prominent political family in the Ivory Coast , he holds dual Ivorian and French citizenship . He studied advanced mathematics and physics in France before joining the management consultants McKinsey & Company in 1986 , where he worked until 1994 . From 1994 to 1999 he worked in the Ivory Coast first as chief executive of the National Bureau for Technical Studies ( BNETD ) . Following the 1999 Ivorian coup détat , he resumed a private sector career and rejoined McKinsey in Paris from 2000 to 2002 , then worked as a senior executive for Aviva before being recruited by Prudential .\nEarly life and education .\nThiam was born in the Ivory Coast ( Côte dIvoire ) on 29 July 1962 . He is a descendant of two prominent families from Senegal and Ivory Coast . On his mother’s side , he is a descendant of Queen Yamousso , after whom the capital of Côte dIvoire , Yamoussoukro , is named . Thiams mother , Marietou , was the niece of Chief Félix Houphouët-Boigny , the founder and first President of Côte dIvoire ( known for the quote People are surprised that I like gold . Its just that I was born in it ) .\nHis father , Amadou Thiam , a journalist , was born in Senegal and emigrated to Côte dIvoire in 1947 . He supported Houphouet-Boigny in his fight for the independence of the country and served more than ten years in the Ivorian cabinet after independence .\nTidjane’s uncle , Habib Thiam , was Prime Minister of Senegal for more than 10 years and also served as President of the National Assembly .\nIn 1982 Thiam was the first Ivorian to pass the entrance examination to the École Polytechnique in Paris . In 1984 , he graduated from the École Polytechnique and in 1986 from the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris where he was top of his class . In 1986 he was offered a scholarship to study for an MBA at INSEAD and join the McKinsey Fellows Programme in Paris . He received an MBA from INSEAD in 1988 ( Deans list ) . In 1989 he took a one-year sabbatical from McKinsey to participate in the World Banks Young Professionals Program in Washington , D.C . He returned to McKinsey in 1990 , working first in New York City and then in Paris .\nGovernment career .\nIn December 1993 , the first Ivorian President , Félix Houphouët-Boigny , died and was replaced by Henri Konan Bédié . In April 1994 , at the request of the new President , Thiam left France and McKinsey to go back to Abidjan and become the CEO of the National Bureau for Technical Studies and Development ( BNETD ) , an infrastructure development and economic advisory body with more than 4,000 staff , reporting directly to the President and the Prime Minister . In that role , which had cabinet rank , he was also handling key negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . Thiam was also a key member of the Privatization Committee , in charge of privatising extensive state-owned assets .\nIn August 1998 , in addition to his role at the BNETD , where he became chairman , Thiam formally joined the cabinet and was appointed Minister of Planning and Development . In his years in Côte dIvoire , Thiam promoted private sector involvement in infrastructure development . He implemented flagship projects including the Azito power plant ( nominated by the Financial Times as one of the boldest successful investment decisions in the world , the renovation of Abidjan airport and the construction of the Riviera Marcory toll bridge , whose financing was closed a few days before the 1999 coup . One of the first actions of the new President , Alassane Ouattara , in 2011 was to start the construction of that bridge as originally overseen by Thiam , with the same promoters .\nThiam actively promoted an extensive privatisation programme which saw , between 1994 and 1999 , Côte dIvoire lead African countries by privatising its telephone , services , electric power generation , airports , railways and many companies in the agricultural sector . In 1998 , the World Economic Forum in Davos named him as one of the annual 100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow , and in 1999 the Forum named him a member of the Dream Cabinet . In December 1999 , whilst Thiam was abroad , the Ivorian military seized control of the government . Thiam returned to the country , where he was arrested and held for several weeks . General Guéï , the new head of state , offered him the position of chief of staff , but he declined and left the country in early 2000 .\nPrudential .\nOn returning to Europe , Thiam was offered a partnership by McKinsey in Paris , becoming one of the leaders of the companys financial institutions practice . In 2002 he joined Aviva , initially as group strategy and development director , then as managing director of Aviva International , chief executive of Aviva Europe and an executive director , sitting on the plc board . In January 2007 , after Richard Harvey announced he would step down as chief executive of Aviva , Thiam was tipped as a possible future head of the group . Thiam left Aviva in September 2007 to become chief financial officer of Prudential plc . In March 2009 , Thiam was named chief executive , effective from October , after Mark Tucker chose to step down . The appointment made him the first African to lead a FTSE 100 listed company . His departure from the role was announced on 10 March 2015 .\nAfter he became chief executive , Prudential launched a bid for AIA , the Asian wing of the crisis-stricken AIG . A public battle ensued , with some investors complaining about the $35.5 billion price Prudential was offering to pay . The bid eventually failed , after the AIG board rejected a revised lower bid . AIA was later floated on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , and the value of the company quickly rose above Prudential’s original bid price . Thiam came under strong personal criticism following the failure of the bid , partly as a result of the costs incurred by the company in pursuing the bid . However , he was re-elected as CEO at the May 2011 AGM with a 99.3 per cent vote . The companys performance since the bid appears not to have been damaged by its failure - in the first nine months of 2011 , Prudential delivered a 14 per cent increase in new business profits over the same period in 2010 , with total insurance sales increasing by 10 per cent , while in its full-year results for 2013 , Prudential delivered an IFRS operating profit of £2.95 billion , up 17 per cent from the year before . In March 2013 , the Financial Services Authority fined Prudential £30m and censured its CEO , Thiam , for failure to inform it of its plans to buy AIA and failure of dealing with the FSA in an open and cooperative manner .\nCredit Suisse .\nThiam was appointed the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of Swiss investment bank and financial services company , Credit Suisse Group AG on 10 March 2015 . An hour after his appointment was announced , the company stock increased by 7.5% . During his first two years , he led the bank through a restructuring process cutting costs and jobs . His compensation was US$9.9 million in 2016 and $10.2 million in 2017 . His pay was originally scheduled to be $11.2 million in 2017 , however it was reduced after shareholder backlash . From 2016 to 2019 , Under Thiam , Credit Suisse expanded their wealth management business and generated net new assets of CHF121bn ( €113.7bn ) , and their pre-tax profit from wealth management grew double-digit ( +15% ) for four years in a row , from €2.5bn in 2015 to €4.4bn in 2019 . In March 2018 , Thiam detailed a new profitability track for the company by stating : Weve been cleaning up a lot of undesirable trades that we should not have done.. . Theres no way to clean up the past , given the legacy we have , without generating losses . We have profitable operations of the company .\nResignation .\nIn September 2019 , he became involved in a scandal with Iqbal Khan , a former employee of Credit Suisse who had transferred to UBS . Khan , Credit Suisses former head of Wealth Management , accused Thiam of sending spies after him . The two , who were also neighbors , were alleged to have fallen out over personal issues earlier on . In October 2019 , Credit Suisse cleared Thiam of ordering the botched surveillance . The Homburger inquiry presented its report to the Credit Suisse board and said that Bouée , not Thiam , had independently made the call to follow Khan . Bouée resigned , although he has since said that he intends to sue the bank . Credit Suisses head of global security also resigned .\nOn February 7 , 2020 , Tidjane Thiam resigned amid a power struggle which followed the spying scandal . In a statement , Thiam said : I had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues . It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt . I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place , Thiam said in the statement .\nShares in Credit Suisse more than halved from a late February high through a mid-March low as banks slumped on worries about the impact of sweeping lockdowns across most of Europe put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus ( on February 8 , 2020 , UBS was at 70% of its March 2015 stock price , Credit Suisse 55% ) .\nInternational development .\nIn October 1999 Thiam was appointed by James Wolfensohn as one of 20 members of the External Advisory Council of the World Bank Institute , which the Institute relies on for advice and guidance . Thiam is a member of the Africa Progress Panel ( APP ) , a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa . Every year , the Panel releases a report , the Africa Progress Report , that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies . In 2012 , the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs , Justice , and Equity .\nIn January 2011 Thiam was appointed chairman of the G20s High Level Panel on Infrastructure Investment . Established by the Seoul G20 summit in 2010 , the panel was a grouping of figures from leading financial institutions and development agencies given the task of producing concrete proposals to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure projects in emerging economies . The panel submitted its report to the G20 Summit meeting in Cannes in November 2011 .

    "story": "Leon Panetta\nLeon Edward Panetta ( born June 28 , 1938 ) is an American politician who has served in several different public office positions , including the Secretary of Defense , Director of the CIA , White House Chief of Staff , Director of the Office of Management and Budget , and as a U.S . Representative from California . A Democrat , Panetta was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993 , served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1994 , and as President Bill Clintons Chief of Staff from 1994 to 1997 . He co-founded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy and served as a Distinguished Scholar to Chancellor Charles B . Reed of the California State University System and as a professor of public policy at Santa Clara University .\nIn January 2009 , newly elected President Barack Obama nominated Panetta for the post of CIA Director . Panetta was confirmed by the full Senate in February 2009 . As director of the CIA , Panetta oversaw the operation that brought down international terrorist Osama bin Laden . On April 28 , 2011 , Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as Defense Secretary , to replace the retiring Robert Gates . In June the Senate confirmed Panetta unanimously and he assumed the office on July 1 , 2011 . David Petraeus took over as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on September 6 , 2011 .\nSince retiring as Secretary of Defense in 2013 , Panetta has served as Chairman of The Panetta Institute for Public Policy , located at California State University , Monterey Bay , a campus of the California State University that he helped establish during his tenure as congressman . The institute is dedicated to motivating and preparing people for lives of public service and helping them to become more knowledgeably engaged in the democratic process . He also serves on a number of boards and commissions and frequently writes and lectures on public policy issues .\nEarly life , education , and military service .\nPanetta was born in Monterey , California , the son of Carmelina Maria ( Prochilo ) and Carmelo Frank Panetta , Italian immigrants from Siderno in Calabria , Italy . In the 1940s , the Panetta family owned a restaurant in Monterey .\nHe was raised in the Monterey area , and attended two Catholic grammar schools : San Carlos School ( Monterey ) and Junípero Serra School ( Carmel ) . He attended Monterey High School , a public school where he became involved in student politics , and was a member of the Junior Statesmen of America . As a junior , he was the vice president of the Student Body , and as a senior , he became its president . In 1956 , he entered Santa Clara University , California , and graduated magna cum laude in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science . In 1963 , he received a Juris Doctor from the Santa Clara University School of Law .\nIn 1964 , he joined the United States Army as a Second Lieutenant , where he served as an officer in Army Military Intelligence , and received the Army Commendation Medal . In 1966 , he was discharged as a First Lieutenant .\nPolitical career .\nEarly political career .\nPanetta started in politics in 1966 as a legislative assistant to Republican Senator Thomas Kuchel , the United States Senate Minority Whip from California , whom Panetta has called a tremendous role model .\nIn 1969 he became the assistant to Robert H . Finch , Secretary of the United States Department of Health , Education , and Welfare under the Nixon administration . Soon thereafter he was appointed Director of the Office for Civil Rights .\nPanetta chose to enforce civil rights and equal education laws over the objection of President Nixon , who wanted enforcement to move slowly in keeping with his strategy to gain political support among Southern whites . Robert Finch and Assistant Secretary John Veneman supported Panetta and refused to fire him , threatening to resign if forced to do so . Eventually forced out of office in 1970 , Panetta left Washington to work as Executive Assistant for John Lindsay , the then-Republican Mayor of New York City ( Lindsay would switch parties the following year. ) Panetta wrote about his Nixon administration experience in his 1971 book Bring Us Together .\nHe moved back to Monterey to practice law at Panetta , Thompson & Panetta from 1971 to 1976 .\nU.S . House of Representatives .\nElections .\nLike Lindsay , Panetta switched to the Democratic Party in 1971 , because , he said , he thought that the Republican Party was moving away from the political center . In 1976 , Panetta was elected to the U.S . Congress to represent Californias then-16th congressional district , unseating incumbent Republican Burt Talcott with 53% of the vote . He would never face another contest nearly that close , and was reelected eight times . ( With a few boundary adjustments , the 16th district became the 17th district after the 1990 census and is the 20th district today . It consists of all of Monterey and San Benito Counties , plus most of Santa Cruz County , including the city of Santa Cruz . At the time of Panettas first election , it also included the northern part of San Luis Obispo County. )\nTenure .\nDuring his time in Congress , Panetta concentrated mostly on budget issues , civil rights , education , healthcare , agriculture , immigration , and environmental protection , particularly preventing oil drilling off the California coast . He wrote the Hunger Prevention Act ( Public Law 100–435 ) of 1988 and the Fair Employment Practices Resolution . He was the author of legislation establishing the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary , and legislation providing Medicare coverage for hospice care . Working with Chancellor Barry Munitz of CSU , he helped establish CSU Monterey Bay at the former Fort Ord military base .\nHe also attempted to form the Big Sur National Scenic Area with Senator Alan Cranston . The bill would have created a scenic area administered by the U.S . Forest Service . It budgeted $100 million to buy land from private land owners , up to $30 million for easements and management programs , and created a state plan for a zone about long and wide along the Big Sur coast .\nThe bill was opposed by California Senator S . I . Hayakawa , development interests , and Big Sur residents . Local residents mocked the plan as Panettas Pave n Save , and raised a fund of more than $100,000 to lobby against the proposal . The legislation was blocked by Hayakawa in the Energy Committee and did not reach a vote .\nBudget Committee .\nA member of the House Committee on the Budget from 1979 to 1989 , and its chairman from 1989 to 1993 , Panetta played a key role in the 1990 Budget Summit .\nCommittee assignments .\nHis positions included :\n- Chairman of the U.S . House Committee on the Budget\n- Chairman of the Agriculture Committees Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing , Consumer Relations , and Nutrition\n- Chairman of the Administration Committees Subcommittee on Personnel and Police\n- Chairman of the Task Force on Domestic Hunger created by the U.S . House Select Committee on Hunger\n- Vice Chairman of the Caucus of Vietnam-Era Veterans in Congress\n- Member of the Presidents Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies .\nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget .\nThough elected to a ninth term in 1992 , Panetta left the House at the beginning of 1993 , after President-elect Bill Clinton selected him to serve as Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget . In that role he developed the budget package that would eventually result in the balanced budget of 1998 .\nWhite House Chief of Staff .\nIn 1994 , President Clinton became increasingly concerned about a lack of order and focus in the White House and asked Panetta to become his new chief of staff , replacing Mack McLarty . According to author Nigel Hamilton , Panetta replaced McLarty for the rest of Clintons first term—and the rest is history . To be a great leader , a modern president must have a great chief of staff—and in Leon Panetta , Clinton got the enforcer he deserved . Panetta was appointed White House Chief of Staff on July 17 , 1994 , and he held that position until January 20 , 1997 . He was a key negotiator of the 1996 budget , which was another important step toward bringing the budget into balance .\nDirector of the CIA .\nNomination .\nOn January 5 , 2009 , President-elect Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Panetta to the post of Director of the Central Intelligence Agency .\nAt the time of his selection , journalists and politicians raised concerns about Panettas limited experience in intelligence , aside from his two-year service as a military intelligence officer in the 1960s . California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , expressed concerns that she was not consulted about the Panetta appointment and stated her belief that the Agency is best-served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time .\nFormer CIA officer Ishmael Jones stated that Panetta was a wise choice , because of his close personal connection to the President and lack of exposure to the CIA bureaucracy . Also , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said that Panetta did have exposure to intelligence operations as Director of the OMB and as Chief of Staff for President Bill Clinton , where he sat in on the daily intelligence briefings as chief of staff , and he reviewed the nations most secret intelligence-collection and covert-action programs in his previous post as director of the Office of Management and Budget .\nOn February 12 , 2009 , Panetta was confirmed in the full Senate by voice vote .\nTenure .\nOn February 19 , 2009 , Panetta was sworn in as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency by Vice President Joe Biden before an audience of CIA employees . Panetta reportedly received a rock star welcome from his new subordinates .\nAs CIA Director , Panetta traveled extensively to intelligence outposts around the world and worked with international leaders to confront threats of Islamic extremism and Taliban . In 2010 working with the Senate Intelligence Committee , he conducted a secret review of the use of torture by the CIA ( euphemistically referred to as enhanced interrogation techniques ) during the administration of George W . Bush . The review , which came to be known by 2014 as the Panetta Review , yielded a series of memoranda that , according to The New York Times , cast a particularly harsh light on the Bush-era interrogation program . The Times notes The effort to write the exhaustive history of the C.I.A.’s detention operations was fraught from the beginning . President Obama officially ended the program during his first week in office , in 2009 . The intelligence committee announced its intention to take a hard look at the program , but there was little appetite inside the [ Obama ] White House to accede to the committee’s request for all classified C.I.A . cables related to it . The findings of the Panetta Review reportedly aligned with much of what the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found in its factual accounting . Both reports were largely seen as an effort in fact-finding and prevention , but not a governmental path towards some possible project of accountability or punishment for past interrogation or torture .\nPanetta supported the Obama administrations campaign of U.S . drone strikes in Pakistan , which he identified as the most effective weapon against senior al-Qaeda leadership . Drone strikes increased significantly under Panetta , with as many as 50 suspected al-Qaeda militants being killed in May 2009 alone .\nAs Director of the CIA , Panetta oversaw the hunt for terrorist leader Osama bin Laden , and played a key role in the operation in which bin Laden was killed on May 1 , 2011 .\nUnder Panetta , the CIA advanced workplace rights and benefits for LGBT employees ; the agency for the first time implemented policies extending benefits to the same-sex partners of employees .\nSecretary of Defense ( 2011–2013 ) .\nNomination .\nOn April 28 , 2011 , President Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as United States Secretary of Defense as a replacement for retiring Secretary Robert Gates . On June 21 , 2011 , the Senate confirmed Panetta in an unusual 100–0 vote . He was sworn in on July 1 , 2011 .\nTenure .\nOne of Panettas first major acts as Defense Secretary was to jointly certify with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the military was prepared to repeal Dont Ask , Dont Tell , which triggered final repeal after 60 days .\nIn August 2011 , Panetta publicly warned that deeper cuts in the defense budget risked hollowing out the military and would hamper Pentagon efforts to deal with rising powers such as China , North Korea , and Iran and he urged Congress not to go beyond the roughly $500 billion in defense cuts required over the next decade under the debt reduction bill signed by President Barack Obama . Working with military and civilian leaders at the Department of Defense , Panetta developed a new defense strategy for the 21st century .\nFunding the United States military , in the face of tightening budget constraints , became an ongoing theme of Panettas tenure . He also warned that future service members may see changes in retirement benefits , and that the military healthcare system may need reforms , to rein in costs , while also ensuring quality care .\nAnother major issue during Panettas tenure as Defense Secretary was the Obama administrations diplomatic effort to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons . In January 2012 , Panetta stated that nuclear weapons development was a red line that Iran would not be allowed to cross—and that the United States was keeping all options , including military ones , open to completely prevent it . He said that Iran would not be allowed to block the Straits of Hormuz .\nIn January 2013 , shortly before his departure from the Defense Secretary post , Panetta announced that women would be allowed to enter all combat jobs in the military , citing an assessment phase in which each branch of service will examine all its jobs and units not currently integrated and then produce a timetable for integrating them .\nActivities outside politics .\nPanetta and his wife Sylvia founded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy in December 1997 and served as co-directors there until 2009 , when Panetta was appointed CIA director by President Obama . He has since returned to the Institute in the role of Chairman , while his wife serves as Co-Chair and CEO , supervising the institutes day-to-day operations . The institute is located at California State University , Monterey Bay , a campus Panetta was instrumental in creating on the site of the decommissioned Fort Ord Army base when he was a Congressman . Coincidentally , Panetta was stationed at Fort Ord in the 1960s during his service as an Army intelligence officer .\nPanetta served on the board of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation , as a Distinguished Scholar to the Chancellor of California State University and as a Presidential Professor at Santa Clara University . He was urged to consider running for Governor of California during the recall election in 2003 but declined in part because of the short time available to raise the necessary campaign funds .\nPanetta has long been an advocate for the worlds oceans . In addition to introducing legislation and winning passage of ocean protections measures such as the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary during his time in Congress , he was named chairman in 2003 of the Pew Oceans Commission , which in 2005 combined with the U.S . Commission on Ocean Policy to establish the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative . Panetta now co-chairs the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative with Admiral James D . Watkins , U.S . Navy ( Ret. ) and continues to serve as a Commission member . Panetta also serves as an advocate and information source for other ocean organizations , including the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation and the Monterey Bay Aquarium .\nIn 2006 , Panetta was part of the presidentially-appointed Iraq Study Group , or Baker Commission , which studied potential changes in U.S . policy in Iraq .\nIn 2014 , Panetta published his memoir Worthy Fights , in which he recounted his long career in public service . While overwhelmingly positive in his assessment of the Obama presidency , Panetta aired some disagreements in the book with the Presidents policies in Syria and Iraq . Panetta said : By failing to persuade Iraqs leader to allow a continuing force of US troops , the commander in chief created a vacuum . . . and its out of that vacuum that ISIS began to breed .\nHe regularly obtains fees for speaking engagements , including from the Carlyle Group . He is also a supporter of Booz Allen Hamilton .\nAfter Secretary of Defense ( 2013–present ) .\nPanetta was a speaker on Day 3 of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in which Hillary Clinton was nominated to run as the Democratic candidate in the presidential election that year . Notably , his speech was booed by anti-war supporters of Bernie Sanders who protested his war record .\nPanetta told CBS News that Congress releasing the Nunes Memo , which purported to provide intelligence about the open Russia probe , could cause damage to national security .\nResponsibilities .\nPanetta has held positions within a number of institutions and corporations , including :\n- Joint Ocean Commission Initiative , Commissioner and Co-Chair\n- Pew Oceans Commission , Commissioner and Chairman\n- Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , Co-Chair\n- Bread for the World , Board of Directors\n- National Marine Sanctuary Foundation , Board of Directors\n- National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management , Board of Directors ( 2004–2009 )\n- New York Stock Exchange ,\n- Co-chairman of the Corporate Accountability and Listing Standards Committee\n- Board of Directors ( 1997–present )\n- Close Up Foundation , Board of Directors ( 1999–present )\n- Connetics Investor Relations , Board of Directors ( 2000–present )\n- Fleishman-Hillard ,\n- Co-chairman of the Corporate Accountability and Listing Standards Committee\n- Co-chairman of the Corporate Credibility Advisory practice\n- Member of the International Advisory Board\n- Junior Statesmen Foundation Inc. , Trustee ( 2004 )\n- Public Policy Institute of California , Board of Directors\n- Blue Shield of California , Board of Directors ( 2013–present )\n- Oracle Corporation , Board of Directors ( 2015–present )\nIn June 2002 , the U.S . Conference of Catholic Bishops appointed Panetta to their National Review Board , which was created to look into the Catholic Churchs sexual abuse scandal . This created controversy because of Panettas pro-choice stance on abortion and other views seen as conflicting with those of the Church .\nPanetta is also a member of the Partnership for a Secure Americas bipartisan Advisory Board . The Partnership is a non-profit organization based in Washington , DC that promotes bipartisan solutions to national security and foreign policy issues .\nPanetta serves on the Advisory Board of the Committee to Investigate Russia .\nPersonal life .\nPanetta is married to Sylvia Marie Varni , who administered his home district offices during his terms in Congress .

    "story": "Tom Campbell ( California politician )\nThomas John Campbell ( born August 14 , 1952 ) is an American academic , educator , and politician . He is a Professor of Law at the Dale E . Fowler School of Law , and a Professor of Economics at the George Argyros School of Business and Economics , at Chapman University , in Orange , California .\nHe was Dean of Chapman University School of Law from 2011–16 , Director of Finance for the State of California from 2004 to 2005 , a former five-term Republican United States Congressman from Californias 12th and 15th districts , a former member of the California State Senate , a former professor at Stanford Law School , former dean of the Haas School of Business , and former professor of business administration at the University of California , Berkeley .\nIn 2000 he retired from his House seat to run for the U.S . Senate but lost decisively to incumbent Dianne Feinstein . On June 8 , 2010 , he lost his third bid for the United States Senate , campaigning once again for the seat held by Democrat Barbara Boxer but losing the Republican nomination to Carly Fiorina .\nCampbell is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One .\nEarly life .\nBorn in Chicago , Campbell was the valedictorian of Chicagos St . Ignatius College Prep , Class of 1969 . He went on to obtain his B.A . and M.A . degrees from the University of Chicago ( 1973 ) , a J.D . from Harvard Law School ( 1976 ) and then a subsequent Ph.D . in economics from the University of Chicago ( 1980 ) . He served as a clerk to U.S . Supreme Court Justice Byron White from 1977 to 1978 and , the year before that , for U.S . Court of Appeals Judge George E . MacKinnon . His mentor was Milton Friedman . Tom Campbells father was the late Hon . William Joseph Campbell , a former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois . While Tom Campbell was raised in a Democratic family , he joined the Republican Party in 1980 .\nCampbell was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1976 and went into private practice in Chicago . He was a White House Fellow in the offices of the Chief of Staff and Counsel ( 1980–1981 ) . He then served in the Reagan Administration as Director of the Bureau of Competition in the Federal Trade Commission from 1981-1983 , the youngest person ever to serve in that position .\nLaw professor .\nCampbell became a law professor at Stanford Law School in 1983 , receiving tenure as a full professor in 1987 .\nCongressional and State Senate career .\nCampbell ran for the Republican nomination in Californias 12th Congressional District , which included his home in Campbell and the campus of Stanford University . The 12th had traditionally been a moderate Republican bastion , but had grown increasingly friendly to Democrats over the years . Campbell soundly defeated first-term incumbent Ernie Konnyu in the Republican primary and narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent , San Mateo County Supervisor Anna Eshoo . He served two terms before making an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat being vacated by Alan Cranston . He lost the Republican primary to a considerably more conservative Republican , Bruce Herschensohn , who in turn was defeated by Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Boxer . His political career might have been in jeopardy in any case ; his district had been renumbered as the 14th District and had been made considerably more Democratic than its predecessor . Eshoo won the seat and still holds it today ; no Republican running in this district ( now numbered as the 18th District ) has won more than 39 percent of the vote since Campbell left office .\nIn 1993 , California State Senator Becky Morgan stepped down mid-term , and Campbell won a special election to succeed her ; the state Senate district overlapped significantly with his old congressional district . In the California state Senate , Campbell was Chairman of the Housing Committee , Vice Chairman of the Education Committee , and served on the Budget Committee . California Journal rated him the Best Problem Solver in the State Senate , the Most Ethical State Senator , and the overall Best State Senator .\nIn 1995 , 15th District Democratic Congressman Norman Mineta , later the Secretary of Commerce under President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Transportation under George W . Bush , unexpectedly resigned . Campbells home had been re-drawn into this San Jose-based district , and he ran in the special election . Mineta had held the seat since 1975 , and it was widely considered a safe Democratic district . Despite the considerable disadvantage in voter registration and Democratic attempts to tie him to Speaker Newt Gingrich , Campbell won the December special election easily . He won a full term almost as easily in 1996 and was handily re-elected in 1998 .\nDuring both of his stints in Congress , Campbell was regarded as one of the most moderate House Republicans . Though conservative on fiscal matters , he is socially liberal , being pro-choice on abortion and in favor of gay rights . This was not surprising , as Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate on social and environmental matters than their counterparts in the rest of California . He has a decided libertarian streak , and remains popular with libertarian-leaning Republicans . As a fiscal conservative , he was the only Republican in the House to vote against the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 .\nCampbell led a group of 17 bipartisan members of Congress who filed a lawsuit against President Clinton in 1999 over his conduct of the war in Kosovo . In the filing , they accused Clinton of not reporting to Congress within 48 hours on the status of the action as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution and not first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress as required in the Constitution . Congress had voted 427 to 2 against a declaration of war with Yugoslavia and had voted to deny support for the air campaign . A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit , ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after the U.S . was actively engaged in the war with Kosovo , legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war . Campbell said afterwards that this was a sidestepping of the law , and lawmakers who disagree with a war should not be forced to cut off funding for troops who are in the midst of it in order to get a judge to order an end to it .\nIn 2000 , Campbell won the Republican nomination to take on Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein . Although he touted his service as a moderate Republican representing a strongly Democratic district , he was considered a decided underdog . Campbell was badly defeated , losing by over 19 points . He even lost his own district by almost 15 points . Democratic State Assemblyman Mike Honda , a Mineta protege , won Campbells House seat by 12 points over Republican State Assemblyman Jim Cunneen , a former aide to Campbell . As of 2020 , Campbell is the last elected Republican to have represented a significant portion of San Jose above the county level .\nIn 2008 , Campbell wrote in Reason that he would be voting no on Proposition 8 , the proposed ballot measure banning same-sex marriage in the state , per his Republican beliefs that government should be limited . Government has no business making distinctions between people based on their personal lives . Proposition 8 eventually passed by a margin of 52-48% .\nCampbell is a supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact .\nReturn to legal scholarship .\nIn 2000 , Campbell returned to Stanford . He remained there until his appointment at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley in 2002 . In the intervening years , he began to assemble the material , out of his professional political experiences , for his book The Separation of Powers in Practice with Stanford University Press .\nAs Dean of the Haas School , Campbell stressed the study of corporate social responsibility and business ethics amid an era of corporate scandals . A full-fledged Center for Responsible Business was established . In September 2004 , Campbell was named by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to his newly formed Council of Economic Advisors . From 2004 to 2005 , Campbell took a leave of absence from his Berkeley post to serve as director of the California Department of Finance in the Schwarzenegger administration .\nOn August 27 , 2007 , Campbell announced that he would step down from his position at Haas in the summer of 2008 .\nIn mid-2008 , Campbell joined the Palo Alto office of Los Angeles-based Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher LLP . Campbell joined the Chapman School of Law for a 2-year visiting appointment which began January 2009 , serving as the Fletcher Jones Distinguished Visiting Professor at Chapman University School of Law . In February 2011 , Chapman announced that Campbell would be its new Dean . Campbell replaced interim Dean Scott Howe , who replaced Dean John C . Eastman , who stepped down to seek the 2010 Republican nomination for Attorney General of California ( Campbell had filed paperwork to seek the 2010 Republican nomination for Governor of California the day after stepping down as Dean of Haas before going on to seek the 2010 Republican nomination for U.S . Senator from California ; neither Eastman and Campbell won the Republican nomination in their respective races ) .\nReturn to politics .\nIn July 2008 , Tom Campbell filed the necessary paperwork in order to establish a committee with the intent to raise funds for a prospective race for the Republican nomination to be Governor of California in 2010 .\nOn January 13 , 2010 , the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell would run for the United States Senate , instead of for Governor of California .\nCampbells Web Site confirmed it . In the primary on June 8 , Campbell finished a distant second to former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , in a race that also included State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore . The primary election received national attention , in part due to a campaign ad released by Carly Fiorina , depicting Campbell as a Demon Sheep .\n2016 U.S . presidential election .\nIn August 2016 , Campbell published an op-ed in The Mercury News calling on the Republican National Committee to replace Donald Trump as the nominee for President , and saying Campbell would withdraw from the Republican Party if that did not happen . Campbell wrote :\nOn Aug . 9 , Trump said , If she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do , folks . .. . Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is , I dont know . Trumps campaign explained this meant Second Amendment supporters would defeat Clinton at the ballot box . That , however , is not a logical interpretation of the remark . The context was what can be done if Clinton becomes president ; not what can be done to stop her from becoming president . As such , this is a statement of great recklessness , made all the more so by our present environment of violence used to advance extremism .\nTrumps words were similar to other calls he has made to ignore the rule of law . He has proposed ordering members of the U.S . military to violate American law regarding torture , assuring us that his orders , rather than the law , would be obeyed . He has encouraged physical violence by individuals against protesters at his rallies , assuring anyone doing so that he would cover their legal costs . He has threatened to use the antitrust laws against a company and an individual because the newspaper that individual owns has criticized him .\nCampbell also said he could not support the Democratic nominee , Hillary Clinton , either , due to her involvement in the email controversy . Campbell officially changed his registration to independent shortly thereafter .\nIn 2016 , Campbell wrote a column for the Orange County Register , which , while not endorsing Gary Johnson for president , suggested libertarian-leaning Republicans should consider him . Campbell was later one of 30 former Republican members of Congress who wrote an open letter denouncing Trumps candidacy . Campbell was also included on a list of potential Supreme Court nominees issued by Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson . Campbell was speculated to be a possible candidate for the Libertarian nomination in 2020 , but instead he endorsed former Judge Jim Gray for the nomination . Campbell proceeded to co-found the centrist Common Sense Party due to what he perceived as a want for such a party among California residents .\nPersonal life .\nCampbell married Susanne Martin in 1978 .\nAwards .\n2016 Anti-Defamation League Orange County/Long Beach Marcus Kaufman Jurisprudence Award\n1998 University of Chicago Alumni Professional Achievement Award\nBooks .\n- Separation of Powers in Practice ( 2004 )\nExternal links .\n- CAMPBELL , Thomas J. , ( 1952– ) , Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n- Our Campaigns\n- Profile at Chapman University\n- Join California Tom Campbell",

    "story": "Thomas Joseph Byrnes\nThomas Joseph Byrnes ( 11 November 1860 – 27 September 1898 ) was Premier of Queensland from April 1898 until his death in October of the same year , having previously served in several ministerial positions in his parliamentary career . He was the first Roman Catholic Premier of Queensland and the first to die in office .\nEarly life .\nByrnes was born in Spring Hill , Queensland , to Irish immigrants Patrick Byrnes and his wife Anna , née Tighe . Byrnes was educated at Bowen State School , then , winning a scholarship where he topped the state , he studied at Brisbane Grammar School and then studied arts and law at the University of Melbourne , graduating with honours in both . During his time at the University of Melbourne he was Prelector of the Dialectic Society of Trinity College ( University of Melbourne ) , winning the Societys inaugural Wigram Allen Prize in 1883 , only months after it had been established by Sir George Wigram Allen . In 1882-83 Byrnes taught at Xavier College .\nCareer .\nByrnes was admitted as a barrister in Victoria on 8 July 1884 and returned for a Queensland admission on 5 August ; he then began a successful career as a barrister . Byrnes talent brought him to the attention of fellow barrister Sir Samuel Griffith , then Premier of Queensland , who had him appointed Solicitor-General with a seat in the Legislative Council . Byrnes stood down from the Legislative Council to successfully stand for Cairns in the Legislative Assembly in 1893 . He represented Cairns until 1896 , after which he represented Warwick in the Legislative Assembly from 1896 to his death in 1898 .\nByrnes continued his private law practice and participated in two major Supreme Court of Queensland cases . In the Queensland Investment Co . v . Grimley case , Byrnes successful conduct of the defence was praised widely . In the John Robb arbitration case of 1892 , praise for Byrnes skill was accompanied by public objection to the high fees paid to Samuel Griffith as leading counsel and to Byrnes as one of his assistants . In 1895 and 1897 , Byrnes represented Queensland at meetings of the Federal Council of Australasia .\nSir Thomas McIlwraith appointed him as Attorney-General of Queensland in the Continuous Ministry , and when Hugh Nelson stepped down as Premier ; Byrnes , the youngest member of the Ministry by a large margin , became Premier .\nLate life .\nByrnes ability had led many to expect great things of him , but he contracted measles then pneumonia and died on 27 September 1898 . Byrnes was accorded a state funeral which proceeded from St Stephens Cathedral to the Toowong Cemetery . Never married , he was survived by several brothers and sisters .\nLegacy .\nByrnes is commemorated by two statues , one in Centenary Place in Brisbane and the heritage-listed T J Byrnes Monument in Warwick , both funded by public subscriptions .\nThe commissioning of the Brisbane statue encountered a series of setbacks . The sculptor Achille Simonetti was approached by the committee to create the statue . However , Simonetti had never seen Byrnes during his life and produced a plaster cast from photographs for the committees approval before commencing the statue . The committee did not think the cast was sufficiently like Byrnes and there were a number of iterations before they were satisfied . Then there was an argument of whether Byrnes should be depicted in a university gown or in an ordinary frock coat , deciding on a frock coat in order to depict Byrnes as the premier rather than as a lawyer . Then as Simonetti was tendering to provide a 9-foot-tall bronze statue for £1,800 , a local sculptor James Laurence Watts offered to provide the statue for only £1,000 , dividing the committee . However , after Byrnes sisters indicated their strong preference for Simonettis work and Simonetti offered a revised tender of £1400 , the committee went ahead and commissioned the statue from Simonetti . Early in 1900 , the argument about the clothing erupted once more when Simonetti expressed an artistic preference for robes rather than a frock coat , and the committee reversed its decision in favour of robes . During this argument , Simonetti took ill and died . It was then announced in the newspaper that it had been Simonettis wish that his former pupil , James White , should complete his unfinished commissions . The committee negotiated with White , but finally gave the commission to sculptor Bertram Mackennal .\nThe township of Byrnestown in Queensland is named after him , as is its main street Byrnes Parade and its railway station .\nSt Thomass Catholic Church in Camp Hill , Brisbane ( then known as East Coorparoo ) built in 1923 is another memorial to Byrnes . He had owned the land on which the church was built , but it had passed to his sister Matilda Margaret Maloney after his death . In 1916 she agreed to sell the land to the Catholic Church and then , on her death in 1922 , bequeathed £300 towards the cost of erecting a church in memory of her brother .\nReferences .\n- Byrnes , Thomas Joseph — Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search",

    "story": "FDP.The Liberals\nFDP.The Liberals ( , , , ) is a liberal political party in Switzerland . It is the joint-largest party in the Federal Council , third-largest party in the National Council and second-largest in the Council of States .\nThe party was formed on 1 January 2009 , after two parties , the Free Democratic Party ( FDP/PRD ) and the smaller Liberal Party ( LPS/PLS ) , united . In Vaud and Valais , the parties retain separate organisations . Its youth organisation is Young Liberals . With 120,000 members as of 2015 , the FDP has the most members of any party : 20% more than the second-placed Christian Democratic Peoples Party of Switzerland ( CVP/PDC ) .\nThe party is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party ( ALDE ) and an observer member of the Liberal International . The partys president is Petra Gössi . The current FDP representatives in the Federal Council are Ignazio Cassis and Karin Keller-Sutter .\nHistory .\nThe party was formed in 2009 from the merger of the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) and the Liberal Party . The radical Free Democratic Party , also called the Radicals , was Switzerlands major establishment party . Founded in 1894 , the partys classical liberal predecessors had governed Switzerland outright for most of the 19th century , and had been the guiding force behind the creation of modern Switzerland . The Liberal Party , known as the Old Liberals , represented the French-speaking establishment : again rooted in the conservative liberalism of the nineteenth century . It also had a distinctly liberal Protestant outlook .\nIn the 2003 federal election , the two parties formed an electoral alliance . In the election , the Liberals were reduced to four seats , below the five required to form an official grouping in the Federal Assembly , so the two formed a joint caucus . In June 2005 , the two founded the Radical and Liberal Union , which aimed to promote liberal goals through deeper cooperation . In 2007 , the womens arms of the parties merged , while the youth wings merged the following year to form the Young Liberals . Agreement on the merger of the federal parties was agreed in October 2008 . The agreement was adopted on 28 February 2009 , applying retroactively to 1 January 2009 . FDP President Fulvio Pelli of Ticino became the partys first leader , while Liberal President Pierre Weiss was named one of four Vice-Presidents .\nSeparate Free Democrat and Liberal branches remained in competition with each other in Geneva , Valais , and Vaud . In May 2011 , the partys two Geneva branches – Liberal Party of Geneva and Radical Party of Geneva – merged to form a single FDP.The Liberals cantonal branch . In the 2015 federal election , the FDP increased its share of the popular vote by 1.3% , the first time it had increased since the 1979 federal election .\nPositions .\nAs a classically liberal party , the FDP wants to protect civil liberties and individual responsibility . The FDP calls for mutual tolerance of people with different opinions and self-identities , entrepreneurship , social responsibility , the rule of law , and participatory democracy .\nThe party supports neutrality , federalism , direct democracy , and the tax sovereignty of each canton . It believes that national security should be credibly guaranteed by a skilled and strong militia . The party is for a cosmopolitan Switzerland , which benefits from the opportunities that globalization provides . The FDP supports the close cooperation with the EU through bilateral treaties , but rejects accession to the EU . The immigration policy of the party is based on the integration of immigrants , requiring clear and effective rules by means of an integration law . The FDP calls for consistent action against abuse of laws in Switzerland by immigrants , and in repeated cases calls for deporting foreign criminals in accordance with international law . The FDP supports a peaceful foreign policy , which increases the security of Switzerland and prevents an increasing number of refugees .\nEconomic policy .\nThe party believes that an open society and economic freedom are more conducive to prosperity , and greater economic and social stability , rather than a redistributive and regulative state . The FDP wants more freedom of choice rather than restrictions in all areas of private life . According to the partys stance , self-responsibility and competition should dictate the actions of individuals , rather than bans . The FDP wants to ensure that personal initiative is rewarded and not restricted by paternalism . Start-ups , particularly by young people , are to be encouraged .\nThe party stands for a simple tax code , low taxes , and for tax competition among the cantons . It calls for a more citizen-friendly state without excessive bureaucracy and excessive regulation , and for a lean state with lower government spending , which offers only those services which citizens and the private sector cannot provide . The party , which calls for a competitive and sustainable market economy , wants to strengthen Switzerland as a financial and economic hub with as little government interference as possible . It also calls for the reduction of public debt and fiscal deficits . In general , it believes that tax incentives are better than subsidies in creating incentives . The party saw opportunity in the 2007-2010 financial crisis an to carry out financial and tax reforms quickly to improve the situation of companies in Switzerland , and to create 40,000 new jobs by 2015 . The main objectives of energy policy are security of energy supply and increasing energy efficiency . The party wants to support the research of alternative sources of energy for electricity production which generate no carbon dioxide .\nSocial policy .\nThe FDP works toward a society offering genuine opportunities with flexible choices in education , work and family support . It is also aiming at more and better jobs , a sustainable social welfare system which will result in strong national cohesion that counteracts see the divergence of society . This includes stabilizing premium costs in the healthcare sector and combating the abuse of social welfare systems , but also intergenerational equity . The motto of the party in matters of social security is : Solidarity where it is necessary and self-reliance where it is possible . As a profitable investment for the future of society , the FDP wants to promote the highest quality education at all levels , since it considers human capital the most important resource of Switzerland . It considers innovation as a crucial asset for prosperity and wants to improve the position of Switzerland as one of the leaders of innovation .\nThe party is , in principal , in favour of ending marijuana prohibition to encourage safe and legal free enterprise as opposed to a costly war on drugs , emphasizing personal and family responsibility over life choices , as opposed to making such choices a state power . However , many in the party may not be in favour of a full legalization , such as in the U.S . state of Colorado , but just decriminalisation such as the approach in Portugal .\nForeign policy .\nThe FDP opposes Swiss membership in the European Union , saying that Switzerland can only remain a world leader if it remains outside the EU . It strongly supports the bilateral accords that Switzerland has with the EU . In the 2001 referendum , the FDP campaigned against opening negotiations . The FDP believes that international law takes precedence over Swiss law , although it states that Swiss voters should approve international law before it takes effect .\nLeaders .\n- Fulvio Pelli ( 2009–2012 ) , Ticino\n- Philipp Müller ( 2012–2016 ) , Aargau\n- Petra Gössi ( 2016–present ) , Schwyz",

    "story": "Filippo Inzaghi\nFilippo Inzaghi ( ; born 9 August 1973 ) is an Italian former professional footballer and current manager , who serves as head coach of Serie B team Benevento . He was nicknamed by fans and commentators Superpippo or Alta tensione .\nInzaghi played as a striker for several Italian clubs , and spent the most notable spells of his club career with Juventus and Milan , winning two UEFA Champions League titles ( 2003 , 2007 ) , and three Serie A titles ( 1998 , 2004 , 2011 ) . He is the seventh highest scorer in Italy , with 313 goals scored in official matches . He is currently the sixth-highest goal scorer in European club competitions with 70 goals , behind only Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi , Robert Lewandowski , Raúl and Karim Benzema . He is also Milans top international goal scorer in the clubs history with 43 goals . He also holds the record for most hat-tricks in Serie A with 10 .\nAt international level , Inzaghi earned 57 caps for the Italy national team between 1997 and 2007 , scoring 25 goals . He represented his country at three FIFA World Cups , winning the 2006 edition , and he also took part at UEFA Euro 2000 , where he won a runners-up medal .\nClub career .\nEarly career .\nInzaghis favourite footballers as a child were Paolo Rossi and Marco van Basten . The elder brother of fellow footballer Simone Inzaghi , he got his start playing for hometown club Piacenza as a teenager in 1991 , but made only two league appearances before being loaned to Serie C1 side AlbinoLeffe , with whom he scored an impressive 13 goals in 21 matches . In 1993 , Inzaghi moved to Serie B club Hellas Verona and scored 13 goals in 36 league appearances . Upon his return to Piacenza , he scored 15 times in 37 games helping his team win Serie B and proving himself to be an exciting young prospect .\nInzaghi made his Serie A debut when he transferred to Parma in 1995 , but scored only twice in 15 league matches . One of these two goals came against one of his former clubs , Piacenza , literally making him cry . He added another two goals in European competitions that season . The following season , he moved on to Atalanta , finishing as the Capocannoniere ( Serie As top scorer ) with 24 goals , and scored against every team in the league . He was awarded Serie A Young Footballer of the Year and served as team captain in the last game of the season .\nJuventus .\nInzaghi , however , was soon on the move once again to his sixth team in seven seasons , this time to Juventus for a reported 23 billion lire . He formed a formidable attacking partnership along with Alessandro Del Piero and Zinedine Zidane , a tandem which would last for four seasons , under managers Marcello Lippi , and subsequently Carlo Ancelotti , marking Inzaghis longest stint with one team at the time . During his time with the Bianconeri , he scored two Champions League hat-tricks – against Dynamo Kyiv and Hamburger SV – becoming the first player to do so .\nDuring his first season with the club , Inzaghi scored two goals as Juventus beat Vicenza 3–0 in the 1997 Supercoppa Italiana . Juventus won the Scudetto during the 1997–98 season , in which Inzaghi scored 18 goals , including a decisive , Scudetto-winning hat-trick against Bologna . He also scored six goals to help Juventus reach the Champions League final , although they were defeated 1–0 by Real Madrid .\nThe 1998–99 season was less successful for Juventus , as they suffered a defeat in the 1998 Supercoppa Italiana to Lazio , and finished the season with a disappointing seventh place in Serie A . Inzaghi still managed 20 goals in all competitions , finishing the season as the clubs top-scorer ; Six of his goals came in the Champions League , as Juventus were eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual champions Manchester United . During the second leg of the semi-finals in Turin , Inzaghi scored two goals in the first ten minutes , but Manchester United eventually managed to come back and win the match 3–2 .\nInzaghi helped Juventus win the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup , scoring five goals in the semi-finals against Rostov , and two in the finals against Rennes , qualifying Juventus for the UEFA Cup that season . Inzaghi scored 15 goals in Serie A as Juventus narrowly missed out on the title to Lazio , suffering a defeat on the final matchday . The following season , Inzaghi managed 11 goals in Serie A as Juventus finished second in the league for the second consecutive season ; he also scored five goals in the UEFA Champions League , including a hat-trick in a 4–4 draw against Hamburger SV , although Juventus were eliminated in the first round . With 16 goals in all competitions , he was Juventuss top goalscorer for the third consecutive season . However , his once excellent partnership with Del Piero had become less effective in recent seasons , due to their lack of understanding , individualism , and their strained relationship both on and off the pitch .\nMilan .\nDespite a very good tally of 89 goals in 165 games for the Bianconeri , Inzaghi was soon benched in favour of David Trezeguet and on 2 July 2001 signed for Milan for a reported 70 billion lire , or 45 billion lire cash plus Cristian Zenoni . ( Sky Sports reported a smaller total figure , £17 million ) for the 2001–02 campaign by coach Fatih Terim . Juventus announced that the sale of Inzaghi produced a capital gain of €31.1 million to the club , making the actual transfer fee much exceed that figure . Inzaghi , however , suffered a knee injury and missed the first half of the season . Upon his return , he was able to forge a strong goalscoring partnership with Andriy Shevchenko , and he soon racked up an impressive trophy count with the Rossoneri under new manager Carlo Ancelotti , among them the 2002–03 Champions League ( in which Milan defeated his previous team , Juventus , in the final on penalties ) , along with the 2002–03 Coppa Italia ( scoring in a 2–2 draw in the second leg ) , the 2003 UEFA Super Cup , the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana , and the 2003–04 Scudetto . In the 2002–03 Champions League campaign , he scored his record third Champions League hat-trick against Deportivo de La Coruña in the Group Stage and a decisive goal in quarter-finals against Ajax , totalling 12 European goals in that season . In November 2004 , he signed a contract extension with the club .\nInzaghi was able to fully recover from persistent knee injuries that had dogged him for two years to the extent that he regained his predatory goalscoring form by scoring 12 goals in 22 Serie A matches in 2005–06 , along with four goals in five Champions League appearances ; two against Olympique Lyonnais in the quarter-finals and another two against Bayern Munich in the first knockout stage . He scored the decisive goal against the Bavarians in the 2007 quarter-finals , helping Milan to reach the semi-finals of the competition . On 23 May 2007 , in the 2007 Champions League final in Athens , he scored both of Milans goals in their 2–1 victory over Liverpool in a rematch of the 2005 final . He declared after the match :\nAt the start of the 2007–08 season , he picked up where he left off in Athens , scoring the equalizer in the Super Cup in Milans 3–1 victory over Sevilla . Inzaghi capped off the year by scoring two goals in the final of the 2007 Club World Cup , helping Milan win 4–2 against Boca Juniors to take revenge for the defeat on penalties in 2003 .\nOn 24 February 2008 , Inzaghi scored the match-winning goal in Milans 2–1 win over Palermo with a diving header after coming into the game from the bench ; it marked his first Serie A goal in over a year . This was followed by ten more goals in the league , the last against Udinese . This strike against Udinese was his 100th goal for the club in official games . But despite incredible form , Italy national team manager Roberto Donadoni declined to call him for Euro 2008 . In November 2008 , Inzaghi agreed to a contract extension with Milan until June 2010 .\nOn 8 March 2009 , Inzaghi scored his first hat-trick of the season for Milan against Atalanta , leading his team to a 3–0 victory at the San Siro . His 300th career goal came in the 5–1 thrashing of Siena away from home . He then went on to score three goals against Torino , his second professional hat-trick in that season . Scoring this hat-trick enabled Super Pippo — his nickname in the media – to set a record for the player with the most hat-tricks in Serie A over the last 25 years . With ten hat-tricks in Serie A , Inzaghi is ahead of Giuseppe Signori ( 9 ) , Hernán Crespo ( 8 ) , Roberto Baggio , Marco van Basten , Gabriel Batistuta , Abel Balbo , Vincenzo Montella ( 7 ) , Antonio Di Natale and David Trezeguet ( 6 ) . Inzaghi scored one hat-trick for Atalanta , four for Juventus , and five for Milan .\nIn the 2009–10 season , under manager Leonardo , Inzaghi was relegated to the role of backup player with his contract set to expire in June 2010 . On 21 May 2010 , he was offered a new one-year contract which would last until 30 June 2011 .\nOn 3 November 2010 , in the UEFA Champions League 2010–11 Group Stage campaign , with Milan trailing by 1–0 to Real Madrid , Inzaghi came off the bench in the second half and scored a brace to give Milan a 2–1 lead . Pedro León , however , equalized in the 94th minute , with the final score ending 2–2 . On that occasion , he became the new all-time top scorer of all European club competitions with 70 goals . He also became the second-oldest player to score in the Champions League , aged 37 years and 85 days , behind only Manchester Uniteds Ryan Giggs , now surpassed by Inzaghis compatriot Francesco Totti . With these two goals , Inzaghi went ahead of his idol Marco van Basten on the club list of the all-time top goalscorers with 125 goals .\nOn 10 November 2010 , Inzaghi suffered a serious injury while playing for Milan against Palermo . A statement on the official Milan club website confirmed that Inzaghi had suffered a lesion of the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) and associated lesion to the external meniscus of the left knee . It was thought he would be out for the rest of the season . Due to his age , this injury could have ended his career ; nonetheless , Inzaghi was very optimistic . On 7 May 2011 , with Inzaghi still out recovering from his injury , Milan won the 2010–11 Serie A title . After being sidelined by injury for six months , he came off the bench for the first time since his injury on 14 May , with Milan defeating Cagliari 4–1 . He extended his contract till June 2012 during the 2011–12 pre-season .\nJust like with Andrea Pirlo in 2011 , Milan decided not to renew the contracts of several veteran players at the end of the season and Inzaghi was one of those , along with Gennaro Gattuso , Clarence Seedorf , Alessandro Nesta , and Gianluca Zambrotta . He played his final game for Milan against Novara on 13 May 2012 and marked his performance by scoring the winning goal , much to the joy of the fans . On 24 July 2012 , Inzaghi announced his retirement from professional football to start a coaching career .\nEuropean competition records .\nWith 70 goals , Inzaghi is the sixth-highest scorer in European club competitions , behind only Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi , Robert Lewandowski , Raúl and Karim Benzema . He became the first player to score two Champions League hat-tricks – both with Juventus — when he netted a treble during a 4–4 group stage draw with Hamburger SV on 13 September 2000 ; his first was in a 4–1 victory over Dynamo Kyiv during the 1997–98 quarter–finals . Inzaghi scored a record third Champions League hat-trick in a 4–0 win against Deportivo de La Coruña in the 2002–03 season , while playing for Milan . This record would later be tied by Michael Owen , who has scored two hat-tricks for Liverpool and a third for Manchester United .\nInternational career .\nBetween 1993 and 1996 , Inzaghi made 14 appearances for the Italy under-21 team , scoring three goals ; he was also a member of the Italy under-21 squad that won the 1994 UEFA European Under-21 Championship . Inzaghi earned his first senior cap for Italy in the Tournoi de France , against Brazil on 8 June 1997 , under his former under-21 manager Cesare Maldini , and provided an assist to goalscorer Alessandro Del Piero . Italy went on to draw 3–3 . He scored his first goal for Italy on 18 November 1998 , in a 2–2 friendly draw against Spain ; he has since scored 25 goals in 57 appearances . He was called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , Euro 2000 , the 2002 World Cup and the 2006 World Cup .\nAlthough Inzaghi went scoreless throughout the 1998 World Cup , as he was mainly deployed as a substitute , he came off the bench to set up a goal for Roberto Baggio in Italys final group match against Austria , which ended in a 2–1 win , and allowed Italy to top their group ; Italy were knocked out in the quarter finals on penalties to hosts and eventual champions France . At Euro 2000 , he was one of Italys starting strikers under the new Italy manager Dino Zoff . He scored two goals throughout the tournament ; his first came from a penalty , in Italys 2–1 opening group win over Turkey , in which he was named man of the match , while his second came in a 2–0 win over Romania in the quarter-finals of the competition ; he also set up Stefano Fiores goal in a 2–0 win over co-hosts Belgium in his nations second group match of the tournament . His performances helped Italy reach the final , where they were defeated by France once again , on a golden goal . Along with Francesco Totti , he was Italys top-scorer throughout the tournament .\nUnder Zoffs replacement , Giovanni Trapattoni , Inzaghi was Italys top goalscorer during the qualifying rounds of the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 , scoring his first and only international hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over Wales on 6 September 2003 , although he missed the latter tournament due to injury . He went scoreless throughout the 2002 World Cup , making two appearances , as Italy were controversially eliminated in the round of 16 to co-hosts South Korea ; in Italys 2–1 loss to Croatia in their second group match , Materazzi played a floating ball over the top from just over half way to Inzaghi in the 90th minute , but everyone missed the ball and it rolled into the back of the net , although the goal was disallowed after referee Graham Poll claimed that Inzaghi had grabbed an opponents shirt . Inzaghi also had a goal wrongly disallowed in Italys final group match against Mexico , which ended in a 1–1 draw .\nInzaghis persistent knee and ankle injuries put a halt to his international play for almost two years before his resurgence at club level , which resulted in being called up by Italy coach Marcello Lippi for the 2006 World Cup final tournament . Due to the abundance of other top strikers such as Alessandro Del Piero , Francesco Totti and Luca Toni , Inzaghi made his only appearance – subbing on for Alberto Gilardino — in Italys final group stage match against the Czech Republic on 22 June 2006 , scoring his only goal in the tournament , rounding Petr Čech in a one-on-one encounter to net in Italys second goal , which made him the oldest player to have scored for Italy in a World Cup , after Daniele Massaro . Italy went on to win the tournament , defeating France on penalties in the final .\nFollowing Italys fourth World Cup victory , Inzaghi made six appearances under new manager Roberto Donadoni in Italys UEFA Euro 2008 qualification campaign , scoring three goals , two of which came in a 2–1 away win against the Faroe Islands on 2 June 2007 . He was not called up for the final tournament , however , where Italy were eliminated by eventual champions Spain in the quarter-finals on penalties , and he made his last appearance for Italy on 8 September 2007 , in a 0–0 draw against France in Milan .\nInzaghi is currently the sixth-highest goalscorer in the Italian national teams history , with 25 goals , alongside Adolfo Baloncieri and Alessandro Altobelli .\nStyle of play .\nInzaghi was an intelligent , extremely fast , and opportunistic player , with excellent reactions and a lanky , slender physique ; although not very technically gifted , he was known for his great skill in taking advantage of the carelessness of his opponents , his excellent positional sense in the area , and his eye for goal , making a name for himself as a goal poacher , due to his style of play and tendency to operate mainly in the penalty box . These qualities , along with his finishing ability with both his head and feet , made him one of the most prolific strikers of the past decades . Inzaghi was described as a player who lived on the offside line .\nWhen he was first called up to the national team , the other Italian players were surprised at his lack of technical accomplishment , but came to accept him because he scored so frequently . Johan Cruyff grudgingly described this contrast—Look , actually he cant play football at all . Hes just always in the right position . Fans nicknamed him Super Pippo , the Italian name for the superhero alter–ego of Walt Disneys cartoon character Goofy . Tactically , Inzaghi was noted for his vision and ability to read the game , as well as his outstanding offensive movement off the ball , ability to play off the shoulders of the last defender , and to time his attacking runs to beat the offside trap , leading long-time Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to quip , That lad must have been born offside .\nAlthough in the past , due to his poor defensive work-rate , and lack of notable technical skills , strength in the air , or long range striking ability , he was initially accused by some in the sport for being a limited striker or a lucky player , and also drew criticism at times for being selfish , for not participating in the build-up of plays , and for going to ground too easily , he has been praised by several of his former managers and teammates for his prolific goalscoring ; Despite his lack of significant talent , Inzaghi and others attribute his success , aside from technical prowess , to personal drive , intelligence , and determination . Due to his opportunistic playing style , Inzaghi was frequently compared to Paolo Rossi throughout his career . Despite his prolific goalscoring , Inzaghi was often considered injury prone throughout his career .\nCoaching career .\nMilan .\nInzaghi started his coaching career at the beginning of the 2012–13 season , signing a two-year deal as the manager of Milans Primavera ( under-19 ) team .\nOn 9 June 2014 , Inzaghi was named manager of Milans first team after the dismissal of his former Rossoneri teammate Clarence Seedorf . In Inzaghis first match as a manager in Serie A on 31 August , Milan defeated Lazio 3–1 at the San Siro . Inzaghi then led Milan to a second consecutive win in an exciting match that ended with a 5–4 Milan win against Parma .\nOn 4 June 2015 Adriano Galliani , the CEO of Milan , announced that Inzaghi would not be the coach for next season . He was officially dismissed on 16 June 2015 .\nVenezia .\nOn 7 June 2016 , Inzaghi was appointed as the new coach of ambitious Lega Pro club Venezia . On 19 April 2017 , after beating Parma to top spot , he won promotion to Serie B as champions . He also won the Coppa Italia Lega Pro in the same season .\nDuring the 2017–18 season , Inzaghi guided the Venetians to a fifth-place finish in Serie B , finishing in the playoffs positions to earn promotion to Serie A . After eliminating Perugia ( coached by his former teammate Alessandro Nesta ) in the preliminary round , his team was defeated by Palermo in the semi-finals .\nBologna .\nOn 13 June 2018 , Inzaghi was announced as the new head coach of top-flight Bologna , taking over from Roberto Donadoni . He faced a Lazio side coached by his younger brother Simone in an eventual 0–2 defeat on 26 December . Following a record of two wins in 21 games , he was dismissed on 28 January 2019 and replaced by Siniša Mihajlović .\nBenevento .\nOn 22 June 2019 , Inzaghi was appointed manager of Benevento in Serie B . On 30 June the following year , his club achieved promotion as champions with seven games remaining , reaching Serie A for the second time in their history . On his Serie A debut for the team , they won 3–2 at Sampdoria on 26 September , having been losing 2–0 .\nMedia .\nInzaghi features in EA Sports FIFA video game series ; he was on the cover for the Italian edition of FIFA 2001 , and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in FIFA 14 .\nIn 2015 , the arcade game company Konami announced that Inzaghi would feature in their football video game Pro Evolution Soccer 2016 as one of the new myClub Legends .\nHonours .\nPlayer .\nClub .\nPiacenza\n- Serie B : 1994–95\nJuventus\n- Serie A : 1997–98\n- Supercoppa Italiana : 1997\n- UEFA Intertoto Cup : 1999\nMilan\n- Serie A : 2003–04 , 2010–11\n- Coppa Italia : 2002–03\n- UEFA Champions League : 2002–03 , 2006–07\n- UEFA Super Cup : 2003 , 2007\n- FIFA Club World Cup : 2007\nInternational .\nItaly Youth\n- UEFA European Under-21 Championship : 1994\nItaly\n- FIFA World Cup : 2006\nIndividual .\n- Serie A Young Footballer of the Year : 1997\n- Serie A top scorer : 1996–97\n- 2007 UEFA Champions League Final : Man of the Match\n- All time Italys Top goal scorer under UEFA club competition records\n- All time Milans Top goal scorer in Europe\n- Premio Nazionale Carriera Esemplare Gaetano Scirea : 2007\n- A.C .

    "story": "Clover Moore\nClover Margaret Moore ( née Collins , born 22 October 1945 ) is an Australian politician . She has been the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney since 2004 and is currently the longest serving Lord Mayor of Sydney since the creation of the City of Sydney in 1842 . She was an independent member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 2012 , representing the electorates of Bligh ( 1988–2007 ) and Sydney ( 2007–2012 ) . Her recurrent motif is described as making Sydney more liveable for individuals and families . Moore is the first popularly elected female Lord Mayor of Sydney .\nEarly life and background .\nClover Margaret Collins was born in 1945 and grew up in the suburb of Gordon , on Sydneys North Shore , one of three daughters of Kathleen and Francis Collins . She attended Loreto Kirribilli at Kirribilli and Elm Court Dominican Convent , Moss Vale . Moore matriculated to the University of Sydney , and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1969 and a Diploma of Education from the Sydney Teachers College , while residing at Sancta Sophia College . After graduation she began work as an English and History teacher at St Ives High School and Fort Street High School , before moving to London to teach for several years . Moore married Peter Moore , an architect , in 1972 and they had two children , Sophie and Tom . They returned to Australia five years later and settled in the inner-city suburb of Redfern . As a young mother in the Labor Party-dominated South Sydney Municipal Council , Moore became involved in a local resident action group and decided to run for Council in 1980 when she and other members of the group met , after three years of attempts , with the Mayor , Bill Hartup , regarding a local park which Hartup had demanded to have its grass replaced with asphalt ( to aid street-sweepers in seeing broken glass ) , surrounded by barbed wire ( to keep out the drunks at night ) , and to have its lone tree removed ( a nuisance ) .\nMoore was elected as an Independent Alderman for the Redfern Ward of the South Sydney Municipal Council at the 20 September 1980 election . Moore was one of three independents elected to the Council that formed a de facto opposition to the 9-member Labor caucus and Mayor Hartup who controlled the council and generally made most decisions in closed caucus meetings prior to Council meetings . However , in December 1981 , the New South Wales Government amalgamated the South Sydney Council with the City of Sydney , and Moore became a Redfern Ward Alderman of the newly formed Sydney City Council from 1 January 1982 . Moore developed a visible profile in the community , campaigning on a variety of issues both in her position as alderman and in the broader community , particularly in her home suburb of Redfern . Moore was interested in the environment , conservation , and heritage preservation , being involved in the unsuccessful campaign to save the 1936 Rural Bank Building in Martin Place and describing the ALP Lord Mayor , Doug Sutherland , as the Judas of Martin Place for his role in approving its demolition in 1982 .\nMoore ran again for re-election to the three-member Redfern Ward in the 14 April 1984 Council Election , and was highly successful , taking first position , outpolling Bill Hartup with a 21% swing against the ALP , and enabling the election of the second candidate on her independent ticket , Sue Willis , ahead of the sitting Labor Alderman Stan Champley . In May 1984 , Moore ran for the position of Deputy Lord Mayor after the election , but was defeated by the main right-wing Labor candidate , Stan Ashmore-Smith , when the two Independent Communist Aldermen ( Jack Mundey and Brian McGahen ) sided with the Labor caucus in the vote . Moore proved a high profile campaigner on heritage preservation and environment conservation , gaining the ire of the Miscellaneous Workers Union when she confronted a Council worker who was undertaking unsympathetic pruning to trees on a street in Redfern exclaiming its hard enough for trees to survive city pollution without their being massacred by untrained workmen sent to prune them , and denouncing the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust as architectural barbarians , insensitive to the traditions of the ground for approving the demolition of the historic 1909 Sheridan Stand of the Sydney Cricket Ground , which was nonetheless razed in 1986 .\nIn late 1986 , Moore started her campaign to become the citys first female Lord Mayor and defeat incumbent Doug Sutherland , declaring I think everyone would agree it is time for a breath of fresh air and a Lord Mayor committed enough to stay in Sydney to do the job in a criticism of Sutherlands frequent international trips . However , in March 1987 the state government abruptly sacked the Sydney City Council and appointed a board of commissioners to run it until new elections could be held . Having been unceremoniously dismissed from her elected office , Moore , along with five other fellow former independent aldermen Frank Sartor , Bill Hunt , Brian McGahen , Sue Willis and Jack Mundey , formed Independent Watch , an informal grouping with the purpose of scrutinising the decisions of the appointed commissioners and pressing for elections for a new council .\nMember of Parliament .\nInstead of standing again for council , Moore decided to run for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent at the 1988 election , like her previous rival for the Lord Mayor position and fellow former independent alderman , Frank Sartor , who had decided to run as an independent in the inner Sydney seat of McKell . Despite not having the backing of a party , she won the seat of Bligh , narrowly defeating Liberal member Michael Yabsley .\nIn 1991 she co-authored the New South Wales Charter of Reform of Government . In the same year , she was re-elected for a second term with a massive swing in her favour , increasing her share from 26.7 per cent to 43 per cent . Her power also increased dramatically when , along with fellow independents Peter Macdonald and Tony Windsor , she gained the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly . Moore was to again take the spotlight when the Independent Commission Against Corruption handed down a finding that was sharply critical of Liberal Premier Nick Greiner on 1 June 1992 . While the findings were still pending a ruling in the NSW Court of Appeals , Moore and two other Independent MPs made a symbolic march to the NSW Parliament with a threat to withdraw their support of the coalitions minority-government . Hence before the Court ruling was handed down , Greiners hand was forced , and he resigned on 24 June 1992 .\nShe went on to hold her seat with a largely safe margin at the 1995 and 1999 elections . The LGBT community thanked her for her support by featuring likenesses of her in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade that year . She was re-elected again in 2003 .\nPrior to the 2007 election , the Electoral Commission redistributed electoral boundaries , renaming Bligh to Sydney , and moving the seat north and west to encompass the Sydney CBD . Moore was elected to the new seat of Sydney with an increased margin .\nAlthough she sat as an independent in parliament , Moore often worked with other minor parties and independents , particularly with the Australian Democrats , who sponsored some of her bills in the upper house and Moore encouraged voters at the 2011 state election to vote for the Democrats in the upper house , along with South Coast Independent MP , John Hatton .\nMoore resigned as a state MP as a result of new state laws ( labelled in the media as the Get Clover laws ) preventing dual membership of state parliament and local councils . Following her re-election as mayor in the 2012 elections , she was forced to resign the state seat she held for 24 years before the first meeting of the new council . This resulted in a 2012 Sydney by-election on 27 October in which she endorsed independent candidate Alex Greenwich of the Australian Marriage Equality advocacy group who won in a landslide victory . On her departure , former city councillor Elizabeth Farrelly opined : In her 20 years as MP , with more successful private members bills than anyone in a century , Moore has done more to keep the bastards honest than Don Chipp ever did . And in her eight years as lord mayor , she has proved repeatedly that its more confluence than conflict .\nLord Mayor of Sydney .\nIn early 2004 , the Labor Party government under Bob Carr sacked and re-amalgamated the City of Sydney and South Sydney Councils . The move came largely as a surprise , with then-Lord Mayor Lucy Turnbull being notified by a fax posted under her door . The decision to amalgamate the two councils was widely interpreted by the media as an attempt to get the Labor candidate , former federal minister Michael Lee , elected as Lord Mayor , as it would bring a large area of largely Labor-voting suburbs into the City of Sydney . However , several of these suburbs also made up Moores state electorate of Bligh .\nWhen Turnbull announced soon after that she would not seek re-election , Lee appeared to have the position won . Then , on 24 February , Moore entered the race , labelling the councils sacking a cynical grab for power . Despite her ideological differences with Turnbull , she also sharply denounced the sacking of a democratically elected mayor . By the following day , The Sydney Morning Herald was already predicting that she would present a serious challenge to Lee .\nDespite a spirited challenge from Lee , Moore won the election , finishing with more than double the vote of Less as her nearest rival , and ABC election analyst Antony Green announced that she would romp through to win , only 90 minutes after counting began .\nThough she had made a point of not directing voting preferences in her four election campaigns in the Legislative Assembly , Moore decided to support a team of independents for the council race . This turned out to be quite successful , with four of her team of six – John McInerney , Robyn Kemmis , Marcelle Hoff and Phillip Black – being elected to council .\nIn 2008 NSW local government elections Moore was re-elected as Lord Mayor of Sydney . She was returned on a reduced majority in 2012 , winning 51.1% of the Mayoral vote . In the 2016 NSW local government elections she was comfortably returned to office , improving her vote 8.0% to win 59.1% of the popular vote .\nAfter introducing bike lanes through many parts of inner Sydney , Moore broke an ankle on Ride to Work Day in October 2010 , while dismounting from her bike , necessitating that she attend some events in a wheelchair .\nEnergy efficiency .\nUnder Moores leadership , the city of Sydney is aiming to reduce carbon emissions 70 per cent by 2030 . It has installed bicycle lanes ; upgraded its car fleet to hybrids ; planted 10,000 trees ; provided 600 on-street car-share spaces ; installed Sydneys largest building-based solar photovoltaic system ; installed water harvesting in 11 major parks and voted to install two new trigeneration plants .\nMoore stated in an article on Impakter.com in September 2018 that emissions in Sydney have been reduced by 52% and the use of water by 36% since the year 2006 and that the city aims to become carbon neutral .\nBuilding and infrastructure .\nSince becoming Mayor , Moore has been able to bring to completion the construction of several buildings and pieces of infrastructure .\n- Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre ( formerly Ultimo Aquatic Centre ) by Harry Seidler\n- Surry Hills City of Sydney Library by FJMT ( Francis-Jones Morehen Thorpe )\n- Paddington Reservoir Gardens by TZG ( Tonkin Zulaikha Greer )\n- Redfern Park by BVN ( Bligh Voller Nield )\n- Reg Bartley Oval grandstand and kiosk , Rushcutters Bay , by Lacoste+Stevenson\n- Pirrama Park in Pyrmont by Aspect Studios Landscape Architecture , Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects and CAB Consulting .\n- Prince Alfred Park makeover near Central railway station by Rachel Neeson and Nick Murcutt .\n- Burton Street Tabernacle ( to become the new Tabernacle Theatre )\nThere are also :\n- Parks throughout Glebe , Pyrmont , Surry Hills , Rosebery , Elizabeth Bay and St Peters\n- The introduction of a system of cycleways for Sydney , an idea at first criticised and then embraced . The state government tore up one cycleway , subsequently reinstated , and is co-funding another down Oxford Street , noting that cycling increased with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic .\nControversies .\nOn 27 October 2007 Moore proposed a Private Members Bill that would ban the sale of dogs , cats and other mammals in NSW pet stores , and effectively ban the breeding of crossbred dogs . The Pet Industry Association responded with a petition opposing the legislation . The RSPCA Australia has given its support to the measure , although it was rejected by NSW purebred dog breeders .\nBike lanes constructed through Sydney angered many local residents for reducing parking and critics attacked the cost while other groups , including local headmasters and school groups , applauded them . The Bourke Street Cycleway won a Sydney Design Award in 2012 .\nThe City of Sydney Amendment ( Elections ) Bill became law in September 2014 , replacing one optional vote per business with two compulsory votes and it has been alleged that this is one of two statutes designed to bar her from public life .\nBetween 2014 and 2017 Cloud Arch , a steel sculpture intended to be installed over George Street in Sydney , had its budget rise from to 11.3 million dollars . It has been criticised for both the rise in cost , after a re-design , and for not being suited to the citys aesthetic .\nExternal links .\n- Official site",

    "story": "Howard Douglas\nGeneral Sir Howard Douglas , 3rd Baronet ( 23 January 1776 – 9 November 1861 ) was a British military officer born in Gosport , England , the younger son of Admiral Sir Charles Douglas , and a descendant of the Earls of Morton . He was an English army general , author , colonial administrator and Member of Parliament for Liverpool .\nEarly life .\nFollowing the death of his mother , Sarah Wood Douglas , in 1779 , Howard was raised by his aunt , Helena Baillie , near Edinburgh . As a boy , he wanted to join the Royal Navy and follow in the footsteps of his father and older brother . His father agreed to take him to sea when he was 13 , but Sir Charles died of apoplexy while in Edinburgh just after he arrived to collect Howard in 1789 . Howards guardians thought it better that he serve in the Army instead , and he entered the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , in 1790 . He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1794 , becoming Lieutenant a few months later .\nEarly career .\nIn 1795 he was shipwrecked while in charge of a draft for Canada , and lived with his men for a whole winter on the Labrador coast . Soon after his return to England in 1799 he was made a Captain-Lieutenant . In his regimental service during the next few years , he was attached to all branches of the artillery in succession , becoming Captain in 1804 , after which he was placed on half-pay to serve at the Royal Military College ( RMC ) , then located at High Wycombe . He taught military strategy and was an authority on military and naval engineering . He served intermittently as commandant of the senior department and as inspector general of instructions at the RMC . In 1804 , Douglas was appointed to a majority in the York Rangers , a corps immediately afterwards reduced . He remained on the roll of its officers until promoted Major-General . The senior department of the RMC at High Wycombe , of which he was in charge , was the forerunner of the Staff College . Douglas was promoted brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in 1806 . He served in 1808–09 in the Peninsular War and was present at the Battle of Corunna , after which he took part in the Walcheren Campaign .\nOn the death of his half-brother , Vice-Admiral Sir William Douglas in 1809 , he succeeded to the baronetcy . In 1812 he was employed in special missions in the north of Spain , and took part in numerous minor operations in that region , but he was soon recalled , the Home Government deeming his services indispensable to the Royal Military College . He became brevet Colonel in 1814 and CB in 1815 . He became a fellow of the Royal Society on 25 January 1816 .\nEarly writings and promotion to Major-General .\nIn 1816 appeared his Essay on the Principles and Construction of Military Bridges , in 1819 , Observations on the Motives , Errors and Tendency of M . Carnots System of Defence , and in the following year his A Treatise on Naval Gunnery ( of which numerous editions and translations appeared up to the general introduction of rifled ordnance ) . In 1821 he was promoted Major-General . Douglass criticisms of Carnot led to an important experiment being carried out at Woolwich in 1822 , and his Naval Gunnery became a standard text-book , and indeed first drew attention to the subject of which it treated .\nLieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick .\nSir Howard Douglas became Governor of New Brunswick ( 1823–31 ) . He had to deal with the Maine boundary dispute with the United States of 1828 . He also founded Fredericton College ( Kings College ) , now known as the University of New Brunswick , of which he was the first Chancellor . He was governor during the Miramichi fire of 1825 , and his actions during that crisis increased his popularity with the people of the province . He secured a charter for Kings College at Fredericton ( later the University of New Brunswick ) . Some subsequent light is shed on local society in his period of office in the novel Lady Rosamonds Secret . A Romance of Fredericton ( 1878 ) by the Rebecca Agatha Armour .\nLater career in Europe .\nOn his return to Europe he was employed in various missions , and he published about this time Naval Evolutions , a controversial work dealing with the question of breaking the line . From 1835 to 1840 Douglas , now a GCMG , was Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands , where , amongst other reforms , he introduced a new code of laws . In 1837 he became a Lieutenant-General , in 1840 a KCB , in 1841 a civil GCB , and in 1851 a full general . He was given the colonelcy of the 99th ( Lanarkshire ) Regiment of Foot from 1841 to 1851 when he transferred as colonel to the 15th ( the Yorkshire East Riding ) Regiment of Foot , a position he held until his death in 1861 .\nFrom 1842 to 1847 Douglas sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Liverpool , where he took a prominent part in debates on military and naval matters and on the corn laws . He was frequently consulted on important military questions .\nHis later works included Observations on the Modern System of Fortification . and On Naval Warfare With Steam\nSir Howard Douglas died in Tunbridge Wells . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society , and one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society . He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Civil Law from the University of Oxford . Shortly before his death he declined the offer of a military GCB .\nFamily life .\nIn 1797 , while in Quebec City , Douglas fathered a daughter , Margaret ( or Marguerite ) , but did not marry the mother , Catherine Normandeau . In 1799 , he returned to England , and in July of that year he married Anne Dundas , daughter of James Dundas . They had ten children , Major Charles Douglas , James Dundas Douglas , Howard Douglas , General Sir Robert Percy Douglas , 4th Baronet of Carr , Reverend William Frederick Douglas , Ann Douglas , Christina Douglas , Lucy Douglas , Sarah Mary Harcourt Douglas , and Mary Douglas .\nReferences .\nNotes\nCitations\nExternal links .\n- Biography at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies Archives , Memorial University Library Website\n- Sir Howard Douglas",

    "story": "Kieron Dyer\nKieron Courtney Dyer ( born 29 December 1978 ) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder . He is currently the U23s manager at Ipswich Town .\nBorn in Ipswich , Dyer played youth football for his home club Ipswich Town before going on to make nearly 100 league appearances for the clubs first team . He was sold to Newcastle United for £6 million , at the time the highest fee paid for an Ipswich player , and made nearly 200 appearances for Newcastle between 1999 and 2007 . A move for the same fee to West Ham United followed , but Dyer suffered from various injuries , restricting him to 30 league appearances in four seasons . After a short loan back to Ipswich in March 2011 , he signed for newly promoted club Queens Park Rangers ahead of their 2011–12 Premier League season . However , his time at QPR was again blighted by injuries and he made just eight appearances for the club before being released in January 2013 , spending the rest of the season at Middlesbrough before retiring .\nDyer represented England on 33 occasions between 1999 and 2007 . He was a member of the England squads which reached the quarter-finals at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004 .\nClub career .\nIpswich Town .\nDyer was born in Ipswich , to an Antiguan father and English mother . Dyers career began with his hometown team , Ipswich Town , whom he signed for as a 17-year-old trainee in 1996 . He broke into the Ipswich first team during his first season at the club , and quickly established a reputation as one of the top youngsters in English football outside of the Premier League . He had spent three years at Portman Road when he requested a transfer in order to further his international prospects following Ipswichs failure to gain promotion to the Premier League through the play-offs in 1999 .\nNewcastle United .\nDyer was sold to Newcastle United in July 1999 for a fee of £6 million , which stood as the record transfer fee received by Ipswich Town until Connor Wickham was sold to Sunderland . He was the only English player signed by Ruud Gullit during his spell as Newcastles manager . Dyer opened his Newcastle goalscoring account at home to local rivals Sunderland , but the match ended in a 2–1 defeat , which saw Gullit resign shortly afterwards .\nUnder Gullits replacement , Bobby Robson , Dyer was a key player in the Newcastle team which finished fourth , third and fifth in the 2001–02 , 2002–03 and 2003–04 Premier League seasons respectively .\nOn 2 April 2005 , Dyer was involved in an on-pitch brawl with teammate Lee Bowyer in Newcastles Premier League match with Aston Villa , and both had to be pulled apart and separated by their teammates and Villa players . This resulted in Dyer and Bowyer receiving red cards , leaving Newcastle with eight men as Steven Taylor had already been sent-off for a deliberate handball . Dyer was handed a three-match ban by the FA for the sending-off ; Bowyer received a four-match ban from the FA and was fined more than six weeks wages – about £200,000 – by Newcastle . Later in April , The FA increased Bowyers ban by three more matches and fined him £30,000 . In 2006 the Newcastle Magistrates court fined Bowyer £600 and ordered him to pay £1,000 costs after he pleaded guilty to sparking the brawl .\nAt the start of the 2005–06 season , Dyer was once again on the injured list , this time with a hamstring injury , preventing his selection for club or country . This followed a close-season in which Newcastle manager Graeme Souness signed a number of other midfield players , including Emre Belözoğlu , Scott Parker , Albert Luque and Nolberto Solano .\nDyer returned to first-team action on 4 February 2006 against Portsmouth , Newcastles first match following the departure of Souness . Dyer marked his first start of the season since the opening day against Arsenal with a goal in a FA Cup fifth round match against Southampton on 18 February 2006 .\nDyer became the first Newcastle United player to score at the Emirates Stadium in a 1–1 draw with Arsenal on 18 November 2006 . In what was his first start in seven months , Dyer opened the matchs scoring after 30 minutes with his first league goal for Newcastle in over 20 months . He continued his rich vein of form , also scoring against Tottenham Hotspur , Bolton Wanderers , Birmingham City , Aston Villa , AZ and Watford . Following his return from injury , Dyer showed his versatility by playing in central midfield , right midfield and as an attacking midfielder , supporting Obafemi Martins .\nDyer was given permission to speak to West Ham United in August 2007 after both clubs agreed an undisclosed transfer fee . On 4 August , West Ham confirmed the deal had fallen through due to Newcastles pulling out of the deal . However , the deal was rectified with Dyer finalising a move to Upton Park .\nWest Ham United .\nDyer completed a move to West Ham on 16 August 2007 for £6 million , signing a four-year deal . He made his debut for West Ham in a 1–0 away win at Birmingham City on 18 August 2007 . However , this was one of the few positives in Dyers time at West Ham as he was thereafter blighted by injury . Just ten days after his debut , he was stretchered off after a tackle by Joe Jacobson in a League Cup match against Bristol Rovers that resulted in his right leg being broken in two places . Dyer subsequently missed the rest of the 2007–08 season . His injury was re-assessed in August 2008 , when it was decided that a six-week specialist rehabilitation programme was required before he began pre-season training .\nDuring this time , Dyers slow recovery from his injury sparked widespread speculation that his career may be over .\nOn 3 January 2009 , Dyer made his comeback for West Ham after 17 months out , coming on as a second-half substitute against Barnsley in the FA Cup third round tie at the Boleyn Ground . Dyers injuries continued in May 2009 when he was ruled out with a hamstring injury . He played in West Hams first match of the 2009–10 season against Wolverhampton Wanderers , but had problems with injuries after the match . He managed only one more match , away to Blackburn Rovers , before hamstring problems hit again . He returned for two further matches before another injury in September kept him out until returning in a reserve match against Stoke City in November when he scored two goals .\nAfter taking over West Ham in January 2010 , David Sullivan revealed the full extent of the clubs debts , which totalled £110 million . Shortly afterwards , in addition to the swingeing cuts being made by vice-chairman Karren Brady , Sullivan suggested that Dyer should follow Dean Ashton into retirement ; Sullivan expressed the clubs frustration that Dyer , who was earning £60,000 per week , had only played 18 matches in three years . Dyers hometown club Ipswich Town had expressed an interest in re-signing Dyer , but the move stalled amid reports Dyer had demanded a £1 million pay-off from West Ham ; the media had also speculated about whether Dyer could actually pass a medical .\nIn May 2010 , figures in The Daily Telegraph stated that Dyer , who had made only 22 appearances and had never played a full 90 minutes for West Ham , was the clubs top earner on £83,000-a-week . His deal included £424,000-a-season for image rights and £100,000 in loyalty fees . Dyer was released by West Ham at the end of the 2010–11 season , after costing the club around £450,000 for every match he played in .\nReturn to Ipswich Town ( loan ) .\nOn 11 March 2011 , Dyer returned to his first club , Ipswich Town , on a month-long loan . He was handed the number 30 shirt . He made his second debut for Ipswich at Elland Road against Leeds United on 12 March before being substituted in the second half in a 0–0 draw .\nIn April 2011 , West Ham manager Avram Grant refused a request by Ipswich to retain Dyer until the end of the 2010–11 season , and he returned to West Ham after having made four appearances for Ipswich .\nQueens Park Rangers .\nIn July 2011 , Dyer signed a one-year contract with Queens Park Rangers . He made his debut on 13 August 2011 , the opening day of the Premier League season , against Bolton Wanderers , but after just three minutes , he was stretchered off with an injured foot . During his recovery , he sustained ligament damage to his foot in a reserve match . This injury required surgery and he was ruled out for the remainder of the season . Because of his injury , Dyer was omitted from QPRs 25-man squad for the second half of the 2011–12 Premier League season . Despite only playing seven minutes of the 2011–12 season , Dyer signed a one-year contract extension with QPR to keep him at the club until the end of the 2012–13 season . Dyer scored his only goal for the club , in stoppage time , on 5 January 2013 , in an FA Cup third round tie against West Bromwich Albion to finish the match 1–1 , his first goal in almost six years . Just three days later , he was released from QPR by manager Harry Redknapp , who said , [ Dyer ] wasnt in my plans .\nIn January 2013 , after his release , Dyer began training with Ipswich Town to maintain fitness while looking for a new club .\nMiddlesbrough and retirement .\nDyer had returned to Ipswich following his release from QPR and had returned to training with the Championship side in January 2013 .\nOn 31 January 2013 , Dyer signed a short-term contract with Championship club Middlesbrough . Dyers Middlesbrough debut came on 2 February away at one of his previous clubs , Ipswich Town , with Boro losing 4–0 . On 2 March , Dyer scored his first goal in a 2–1 home win over league leaders Cardiff City , his first league goal since 2007 . On 16 April , in a 1–0 home win over Nottingham Forest , Dyer lasted the 90 minutes for the first time since he joined QPR back in 2010 . At the end of his contract , Dyer was not offered an extension , and he left the club .\nDyer returned to Ipswich as an academy coach following his departure from Middlesbrough . He confirmed he had been back training with the first team during the close of the 2012–13 season . There was speculation in the local press at the time that he would soon rejoin for Ipswich , however he was not offered a contract and subsequently retired from playing - but remained at the club as an academy coach .\nInternational career .\nAfter representing England at Youth , Under 21 and B level , Dyers debut for the senior team came on 4 September 1999 when he started in Englands 6–0 win against Luxembourg . He was deployed out of position at right back , and was replaced by Gary Neville at half-time after injuring himself while setting up Alan Shearers third goal of the match . The injury was not serious and he was able to make his second England appearance four days later , coming on as a late substitute for Steve McManaman in a 0–0 draw with Poland . England qualified for the Euro 2000 competition but Dyer was not selected for the squad for the tournament , though he had recovered from injury and taken part in pre-tournament friendlies against Argentina and Ukraine . Along with a number of other young players who failed to make the squad – including Rio Ferdinand , Frank Lampard , Michael Duberry , Jody Morris and Jonathan Woodgate – Dyer took a drunken holiday to the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa . The holiday hit the headlines when a video of Dyer , Ferdinand and Lampard having sex with a number of women was leaked to The News of the World . Shortly after the story broke , it was revealed that Dyer had spent a night in hospital after being glassed in the face during a fight in an Ipswich night club .\nDyer returned to the England squad for the first game after Euro 2000 for the first qualifier for the 2002 FIFA World Cup , against Germany , the last football match at the original Wembley Stadium . England lost 1–0 , after which manager Kevin Keegan resigned .\nDespite having played only 45 minutes of football under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson , Dyer was named in the squad for the 2002 World Cup . Two days after the squad was announced , Dyer suffered knee ligament damage after being tackled by Tahar El Khalej in a league game against Southampton . However , he recovered just in time to remain in the squad . He made three appearances , all as a substitute , in the tournament until England were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Brazil .\nDyer played in several of Euro 2004 qualifiers but only had seven minutes on the pitch at Euro 2004 , coming on as a late replacement for Wayne Rooney in Englands second group match , against Switzerland . After making some appearances during Englands FIFA World Cup 2006 qualifying Dyers run in the England squad was ended by the recurrence of a hamstring injury while playing against Middlesbrough .\nAfter almost two years without making an appearance for England , Dyers form for Newcastle earned him a call up to Steve McClarens England starting line-up for a friendly against Spain in February 2007 . His most recent , and subsequently final , appearance for England came in a 2–1 friendly defeat to Germany in August 2007 , Dyer replacing Alan Smith in the second half .\nCoaching career .\nIpswich Town .\nFollowing his retirement from playing , Dyer took up a role as an academy coach at his first club Ipswich Town in 2014 , becoming assistant manager of the under-18 youth team in August 2018 . He departed the club in August 2019 , outlining his intentions to move into first team management .\nOn 26 October 2020 , Ipswich confirmed that Dyer would be returning to the club to become the head coach of the clubs under-23 team . Dyer has since also become more actively involved in first-team affairs since the appointment of new manager Paul Cook in March 2021 , often assisting with coaching and being present in the dugout .\nTelevision work .\nIn November 2015 , Dyer was named as a contestant on the fifteenth series of Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! . He came fourth on the show after lasting 21 days . He donated his entire fee to the Jude Brady Foundation .\nPersonal life .\nIn February 2018 , Dyer told the public that at the age of 11 he had been sexually abused by his great uncle Kenny , by then deceased .\nHonours .\nIndividual\n- PFA Team of the Year : 1997–98 First Division , 1998–99 First Division , 2002–03 Premier League",

    "story": "Atlanta\nAtlanta ( ) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S . state of Georgia . With an estimated 2019 population of 506,811 , it is also the 37th most populous city in the United States . The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area , home to more than six million people and the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the nation . Atlanta is the seat of Fulton County , the most populous county in Georgia . Portions of the city extend eastward into neighboring DeKalb County . The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River .\nAtlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad . With rapid expansion , however , it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads , spurring its rapid growth . The citys name derives from that of the Western and Atlantic Railroads local depot , signifying the towns growing reputation as a transportation hub . During the American Civil War , the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in General William T . Shermans March to the Sea . However , the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the New South . During the 1950s and 1960s , Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement , with Martin Luther King Jr. , Ralph David Abernathy , and many other locals playing major roles in the movements leadership . During the modern era , Atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub , with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport being the worlds busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998 .\nIt ranks in the top twenty among world cities and 10th in the nation with a gross domestic product ( GDP ) of $385 billion . Atlantas economy is considered diverse , with dominant sectors that include aerospace , transportation , logistics , professional and business services , media operations , medical services , and information technology . Atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and dense tree coverage , earning it the nickname of the city in a forest . Gentrification of Atlantas neighborhoods , initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics , has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline , altering the citys demographics , politics , aesthetic , and culture .\nHistory .\nNative American settlements .\nFor thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settlers in north Georgia , the indigenous Creek people and their ancestors inhabited the area . Standing Peachtree , a Creek village where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee River , was the closest Native American settlement to what is now Atlanta . Through the early 19th century , European Americans systematically encroached on the Creek of northern Georgia , forcing them out of the area from 1802 to 1825 . The Creek were forced to leave the area in 1821 , under Indian Removal by the federal government , and European American settlers arrived the following year .\nWestern and Atlantic Railroad .\nIn 1836 , the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad in order to provide a link between the port of Savannah and the Midwest . The initial route was to run southward from Chattanooga to a terminus east of the Chattahoochee River , which would be linked to Savannah . After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus , the zero milepost was driven into the ground in what is now Five Points . A year later , the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement , first known as Terminus , and later Thrasherville , after a local merchant who built homes and a general store in the area . By 1842 , the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed Marthasville to honor Governor Wilson Lumpkins daughter Martha . Later , John Edgar Thomson , Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad , suggested the town be renamed Atlanta . The residents approved , and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29 , 1847 .\nCivil War .\nBy 1860 , Atlantas population had grown to 9,554 . During the American Civil War , the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a strategic hub for the distribution of military supplies .\nIn 1864 , the Union Army moved southward following the capture of Chattanooga and began its invasion of north Georgia . The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army battles , culminating with the Battle of Atlanta and a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman . On September 1 , 1864 , Confederate General John Bell Hood decided to retreat from Atlanta , and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the Union Army . On the next day , Mayor James Calhoun surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army , and on September 7 , Sherman ordered the citys civilian population to evacuate . On November 11 , 1864 , Sherman prepared for the Union Armys March to the Sea by ordering the destruction of Atlantas remaining military assets .\nRebuilding the city .\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865 , Atlanta was gradually rebuilt . The work attracted many new residents . Due to the citys superior rail transportation network , the state capital was moved from Milledgeville to Atlanta in 1868 . In the 1880 Census , Atlanta had surpassed Savannah as Georgias largest city .\nBeginning in the 1880s , Henry W . Grady , the editor of the Atlanta Constitution newspaper , promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the New South that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture . By 1885 , the founding of the Georgia School of Technology ( now Georgia Tech ) and the Atlanta University Center , a consortium of historically black colleges made up of units for men and women , had established Atlanta as a center for higher education . In 1895 , Atlanta hosted the Cotton States and International Exposition , which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New Souths development to the world .\n20th century .\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century , Atlanta enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth . In three decades time , Atlantas population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs . The citys skyline grew taller with the construction of the Equitable , Flatiron , Empire , and Candler buildings . Sweet Auburn emerged as a center of black commerce . The period was also marked by strife and tragedy . Increased racial tensions led to the Atlanta Race Riot of 1906 , when whites attacked blacks , leaving at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured , with extensive damage in black neighborhoods . In 1913 , Leo Frank , a Jewish-American factory superintendent , was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial . He was sentenced to death but the governor commuted his sentence to life . An enraged and organized lynch mob took him from jail in 1915 and hanged him in Marietta . The Jewish community in Atlanta and across the country were horrified . On May 21 , 1917 , the Great Atlanta Fire destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the Old Fourth Ward , resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people .\nOn December 15 , 1939 , Atlanta hosted the premiere of Gone with the Wind , the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlantas Margaret Mitchell . The gala event at Loews Grand Theatre was attended by the films legendary producer , David O . Selznick , and the films stars Clark Gable , Vivien Leigh , and Olivia de Havilland , but Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel , an African-American actress , was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws .\nMetropolitan areas growth .\nAtlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during World War II due to the citys war-related manufacturing companies , railroad network and military bases . The defense industries attracted thousands of new residents and generated revenues , resulting in rapid population and economic growth . In the 1950s , the citys newly constructed highway system , supported by federal subsidies , allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs . As a result , the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan areas population . Georgia Techs president Blake R Van Leer played an important role with a goal of making Atlanta the MIT of the South . In 1946 Georgia Tech secured about $240,000 annually in sponsored research and purchased an electron microscope for $13,000 ( ) , the first such instrument in the Southeastern United States and one of few in the United States at the time . The Research Building was expanded , and a $300,000 ( ) Westinghouse A-C network calculator was given to Georgia Tech by Georgia Power in 1947 . In 1953 , Van Leer assisted with helping Lockheed establish a research and development and production line in Marietta . Later in 1955 he helped set up a committee to assist with establishing a nuclear research facility , which would later become the Neely Nuclear Research Center . Van Leer also co-founded Southern Polytechnic State University now known as Kennesaw State University to help meet the need for technicians after the war . Van Leer was instrumental in making the school and Atlanta the first major research center in the American South . The building that houses Techs school of Electrical and Computer Engineering bears his name .\nCivil Rights Movement .\nAfrican-American veterans returned from World War II seeking full rights in their country and began heightened activism . In exchange for support by that portion of the black community that could vote , in 1948 the mayor ordered the hiring of the first eight African-American police officers in the city . Much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl , when the Pitt Panthers , with African-American fullback Bobby Grier on the roster , met the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets . There had been controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play due to his race , and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgias Governor Marvin Griffins opposition to racial integration . After Griffin publicly sent a telegram to the states Board Of Regents requesting Georgia Tech not to engage in racially integrated events , Georgia Techs president Blake R Van Leer rejected the request and threatened to resign . The game went on as planned .\nIn the 1960s , Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement , with Martin Luther King Jr. , Ralph David Abernathy , and students from Atlantas historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movements leadership . While Atlanta in the postwar years had relatively minimal racial strife compared to other cities , blacks were limited by discrimination , segregation , and continued disenfranchisement of most voters . In 1961 , the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by realtors by erecting road barriers in Cascade Heights , countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the city too busy to hate .\nDesegregation of the public sphere came in stages , with public transportation desegregated by 1959 , the restaurant at Richs department store by 1961 , movie theaters by 1963 , and public schools by 1973 ( nearly 20 years after the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional ) .\nIn 1960 , whites comprised 61.7% of the citys population . During the 1950s–70s , suburbanization and white flight from urban areas led to a significant demographic shift . By 1970 , African Americans were the majority of the citys population and exercised their recently enforced voting rights and political influence by electing Atlantas first black mayor , Maynard Jackson , in 1973 . Under Mayor Jacksons tenure , Atlantas airport was modernized , strengthening the citys role as a transportation center . The opening of the Georgia World Congress Center in 1976 heralded Atlantas rise as a convention city . Construction of the citys subway system began in 1975 , with rail service commencing in 1979 . Despite these improvements , Atlanta lost more than 100,000 residents between 1970 and 1990 , over 20% of its population . At the same time , it developed new office space after attracting numerous corporations , with an increasing portion of workers from northern areas .\n1996 Summer Olympic Games .\nAtlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games . Following the announcement , the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve Atlantas parks , sporting venues , and transportation infrastructure ; however , for the first time , none of the $1.7 billion cost of the games was governmentally funded . While the games experienced transportation and accommodation problems and , despite extra security precautions , there was the Centennial Olympic Park bombing , the spectacle was a watershed event in Atlantas history . For the first time in Olympic history , every one of the record 197 national Olympic committees invited to compete sent athletes , sending more than 10,000 contestants participating in a record 271 events . The related projects such as Atlantas Olympic Legacy Program and civic effort initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the following decade .\n2000 to present .\nDuring the 2000s , Atlanta underwent a profound physical , cultural , and demographic transformation . As some of the black middle and upper classes also began to move to the suburbs , a booming economy drew numerous new migrants from other areas of the country , who contributed to changes in the citys demographics . African Americans made up a decreasing portion of the population , from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010 . From 2000 to 2010 , Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents , 5,142 Asian residents , and 3,095 Hispanic residents , while the citys black population decreased by 31,678 . Much of the citys demographic change during the decade was driven by young , college-educated professionals : from 2000 to 2009 , the three-mile radius surrounding Downtown Atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 and holding at least a four-year degree , an increase of 61% . This was similar to the tendency in other cities for young , college educated , single or married couples to live in downtown areas .\nBetween the mid-1990s and 2010 , stimulated by funding from the HOPE VI program and under leadership of CEO Renee Lewis Glover ( 1994–2013 ) , the Atlanta Housing Authority demolished nearly all of its public housing , a total of 17,000 units and about 10% of all housing units in the city . After reserving 2,000 units mostly for elderly , the AHA allowed redevelopment of the sites for mixed-use and mixed-income , higher density developments , with 40% of the units to be reserved for affordable housing . Two-fifths of previous public housing residents attained new housing in such units ; the remainder received vouchers to be used at other units , including in suburbs . At the same time , in an effort to change the culture of those receiving subsidized housing , the AHA imposed a requirement for such residents to work ( or be enrolled in a genuine , limited-time training program ) . It is virtually the only housing authority to have created this requirement . To prevent problems , the AHA also gave authority to management of the mixed-income or voucher units to evict tenants who did not comply with the work requirement or who caused behavior problems .\nIn 2005 , the city approved the $2.8 billion BeltLine project . It was intended to convert a disused 22-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and light rail transit line , which would increase the citys park space by 40% . The project stimulated retail and residential development along the loop , but has been criticised for its adverse effects on some Black communities .\nAtlantas cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s : the High Museum of Art doubled in size ; the Alliance Theatre won a Tony Award ; and art galleries were established on the once-industrial Westside . The city of Atlanta was the subject of a massive cyberattack which began in March 2018 .\nGeography .\nAtlanta encompasses , of which is land and is water . The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains . At above mean sea level , Atlanta has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River . Atlanta straddles the Eastern Continental Divide . Rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the Atlantic Ocean , while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the Gulf of Mexico . Atlanta developed on a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River , which is part of the ACF River Basin . The river borders the far northwestern edge of the city , and much of its natural habitat has been preserved , in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area .\nAtlanta is sometimes called City of Trees or city in a forest , despite having lost approximately of trees between 1973 and 1999 .\nCityscape .\nMost of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War , depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture . Yet architecturally , the city had never been traditionally southern because Atlanta originated as a railroad town , rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class , such as Savannah or Charleston . Because of its later development , many of the citys landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the Northeast or Midwest , as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles .\nDuring the late twentieth century , Atlanta embraced the global trend of modern architecture , especially for commercial and institutional structures . Examples include the State of Georgia Building built in 1966 , and the Georgia-Pacific Tower in 1982 . Many of the most notable examples from this period were designed by world renowned Atlanta architect John Portman . Most of the buildings that define the downtown skyline were designed by Portman during this period , including the Westin Peachtree Plaza and the Atlanta Marriott Marquis . In the latter half of the 1980s , Atlanta became one of the early homes of postmodern buildings that reintroduced classical elements to their designs . Many of Atlantas tallest skyscrapers were built in this period and style , displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns , such as One Atlantic Center ( 1987 ) , 191 Peachtree Tower ( 1991 ) , and the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta ( 1992 ) . Also completed during the era is the Portman-designed Bank of America Plaza built in 1992 . At , it is the tallest building in the city and the 14th-tallest in the United States .\nThe citys embrace of modern architecture has often translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation , leading to the destruction of many notable architectural landmarks . These include the Equitable Building ( 1892–1971 ) , Terminal Station ( 1905–1972 ) , and the Carnegie Library ( 1902–1977 ) . In the mid-1970s , the Fox Theatre , now a cultural icon of the city , would have met the same fate if not for a grassroots effort to save it . More recently , preservationists may have made some inroads . For example , in 2016 activists convinced the Atlanta City Council not to demolish the Atlanta-Fulton Central Library , the last building designed by noted architect Marcel Breuer .\nAtlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods . The city contains three major high-rise districts , which form a north–south axis along Peachtree : Downtown , Midtown , and Buckhead . Surrounding these high-density districts are leafy , low-density neighborhoods , most of which are dominated by single-family homes .\nDowntown Atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area , much of it occupied by government entities . Downtown is home to the citys sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions . Midtown Atlanta is the citys second-largest business district , containing the offices of many of the regions law firms . Midtown is known for its art institutions , cultural attractions , institutions of higher education , and dense form . Buckhead , the citys uptown district , is north of Downtown and the citys third-largest business district . The district is marked by an urbanized core along Peachtree Road , surrounded by suburban single-family neighborhoods situated among woods and rolling hills .\nSurrounding Atlantas three high-rise districts are the citys low- and medium-density neighborhoods , where the craftsman bungalow single-family home is dominant . The eastside is marked by historic streetcar suburbs , built from the 1890s–1930s as havens for the upper middle class . These neighborhoods , many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded , architecturally distinct residential streets , include the Victorian Inman Park , Bohemian East Atlanta , and eclectic Old Fourth Ward . On the westside and along the BeltLine on the eastside , former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing , retail space , and art galleries , transforming the once-industrial areas such as West Midtown into model neighborhoods for smart growth , historic rehabilitation , and infill construction .\nIn southwest Atlanta , neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs , including the historic West End , while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout . These include Collier Heights and Cascade Heights , home to much of the citys affluent African-American population . Northwest Atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of Marietta Boulevard and to the north of Martin Luther King , Jr . Drive , including those neighborhoods remote to downtown , such as Riverside , Bolton and Whittier Mill . The latter is one of Atlantas designated Landmark Historical Neighborhoods . Vine City , though technically Northwest , adjoins the citys Downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives .\nGentrification of the citys neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta . The gentrification of Atlanta has its origins in the 1970s , after many of Atlantas neighborhoods had declined and suffered the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century . When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through the citys east side in 1975 , the area became the starting point for Atlantas gentrification . After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990 , gentrification expanded into other parts of the city , stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games . New development post-2000 has been aided by the Atlanta Housing Authoritys eradication of the citys public housing . As noted above , it allowed development of these sites for mixed-income housing , requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units . It has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas . Construction of the Beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path .\nClimate .\nUnder the Köppen classification , Atlanta has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) with four distinct seasons and generous precipitation year-round , typical for the Upland South ; the city is situated in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8a , with the northern and western suburbs , as well as part of Midtown transitioning to 7b . Summers are hot and humid , with temperatures somewhat moderated by the citys elevation . Winters are cool but variable , occasionally susceptible to snowstorms even if in small quantities on several occasions , unlike the central and southern portions of the state . Warm air from the Gulf of Mexico can bring spring-like highs while strong Arctic air masses can push lows into the teens °F ( −7 to −12 °C ) .\nJuly averages , with high temperatures reaching on an average of 47 days per year , though readings are not seen most years . January averages , with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler due largely to the urban heat island effect . Lows at or below freezing can be expected 36 nights annually , but the last occurrence of temperatures below is January 6 , 2014 . Extremes range from on February 13 , 1899 to on June 30 , 2012 . Average dewpoints in the summer range from in June to in July .\nTypical of the southeastern U.S. , Atlanta receives abundant rainfall that is evenly distributed throughout the year , though spring and early fall are markedly drier . The average annual precipitation is , while snowfall is typically light with a normal of per winter . The heaviest single snowfall occurred on January 23 , 1940 , with around of snow . However , ice storms usually cause more problems than snowfall does , the most severe occurring on January 7 , 1973 . Tornadoes are rare in the city itself , but the March 14 , 2008 EF2 tornado damaged prominent structures in downtown Atlanta .\nDemographics .\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Atlanta had a population of 420,003 . The population density was 3,154 per square mile ( 1232/km ) . The racial makeup and population of Atlanta was 54.0% Black or African American , 38.4% White , 3.1% Asian and 0.2% Native American . Those from some other race made up 2.2% of the citys population , while those from two or more races made up 2.0% . Hispanics of any race made up 5.2% of the citys population . The median income for a household in the city was $45,171 . The per capita income for the city was $35,453 . 22.6% percent of the population was living below the poverty line .\nIn the 1920s , the black population began to grow in Southern metropolitan cities like Atlanta , Birmingham , Houston , and Memphis . In the 2010 Census , Atlanta was recorded as the nations fourth-largest majority-black city . The New Great Migration brought an insurgence of African Americans from California and the North to the Atlanta area . It has long been known as a center of African-American political power , education , economic prosperity , and culture , often called a black mecca . Some middle and upper class African-American residents of Atlanta followed an influx of whites to newer housing and public schools in the suburbs in the early 21st century . From 2000 to 2010 , the citys black population decreased by 31,678 people , shrinking from 61.4% of the citys population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010 , as the overall population expanded and migrants increased from other areas .\nAt the same time , the white population of Atlanta has increased . Between 2000 and 2010 , the proportion of whites in the city had notable growth . In that decade , Atlantas white population grew from 31% to 38% of the citys population , an absolute increase of 22,753 people , more than triple the increase that occurred between 1990 and 2000 .\nEarly immigrants in the Atlanta area were mostly Jews and Greeks . Since 1970 , the Hispanic immigrant population , especially Mexicans , has experienced the most rapid growth , particularly in Gwinnett , Cobb , and DeKalb counties . Since 2010 , the Atlanta area has seen very notable growth with immigrants from India , China , South Korea , and Jamaica . Other notable countries immigrants come from are Vietnam , Eritrea , Nigeria , the Arabian gulf , Ukraine and Poland . Within a few decades , and in keeping with national trends , immigrants from England , Ireland , and German-speaking central Europe were no longer the majority of Atlantas foreign-born population . The citys Italians included immigrants from northern Italy , many of whom had been in Atlanta since the 1890s ; more recent arrivals from southern Italy ; and Sephardic Jews from the Isle of Rhodes , which Italy had seized from Turkey in 1912 .\nOf the total population five years and older , 83.3% spoke only English at home , while 8.8% spoke Spanish , 3.9% another Indo-European language , and 2.8% an Asian language . 7.3% of Atlantans were born abroad ( 86th in the US ) . Atlantas dialect has traditionally been a variation of Southern American English . The Chattahoochee River long formed a border between the Coastal Southern and Southern Appalachian dialects . Because of the development of corporate headquarters in the region , attracting migrants from other areas of the country , by 2003 , Atlanta magazine concluded that Atlanta had become significantly de-Southernized . A Southern accent was considered a handicap in some circumstances . In general , Southern accents are less prevalent among residents of the city and inner suburbs and among younger people ; they are more common in the outer suburbs and among older people . At the same time , some residents of the city speak in Southern variations of African-American English .\nReligion in Atlanta , while historically centered on Protestant Christianity , now encompasses many faiths , as a result of the city and metro areas increasingly international population . Some 63% of residents identify as some type of Protestant , but in recent decades the Catholic Church has increased in numbers and influence because of new migrants to the region . Metro Atlanta also has numerous ethnic or national Christian congregations , including Korean and Indian churches . The larger non-Christian faiths are Judaism , Islam , and Hinduism . Overall , there are over 1,000 places of worship within Atlanta .\nSexual orientation and gender identity .\nAtlanta has a thriving and diverse lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) community . According to a 2006 survey by the Williams Institute , Atlanta ranked third among major American cities , behind San Francisco and slightly behind Seattle , with 12.8% of the citys total population identifying as LGBT . The Midtown and Cheshire Bridge areas have historically been the epicenters of LGBT culture in Atlanta . Atlanta formed a reputation for being a progressive place of tolerance after former mayor Ivan Allen Jr . dubbed it the city too busy to hate in the 1960s .\nEconomy .\nWith a GDP of $385 billion , the Atlanta metropolitan areas economy is the tenth-largest in the country and among the top 20-largest in the world . Corporate operations play a major role in Atlantas economy , as the city claims the nations third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies . It also hosts the global headquarters of corporations like The Coca-Cola Company , The Home Depot , Delta Air Lines , AT&T Mobility , Chick-fil-A , and UPS . Over 75% of Fortune 1000 companies conduct business operations in the citys metro area , and the region hosts offices of over 1,250 multinational corporations . Many corporations are drawn to the city by its educated workforce ; , 45% of adults aged 25 or older residing in the city have at least 4-year college degrees , compared to the national average of 28% .\nAtlanta started as a railroad town , and logistics has been a major component of the citys economy to this day . Atlanta serves as an important rail junction and contains major classification yards for Norfolk Southern and CSX . Since its construction in the 1950s , Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport has served as a key engine of the citys economic growth . Delta Air Lines , the citys largest employer and the metro areas third-largest , operates the worlds largest airline hub at Hartsfield-Jackson , and it has helped make it the worlds busiest airport , in terms of both passenger traffic and aircraft operations . Partly due to the airport , Atlanta has been also a hub for diplomatic missions ; , the city contains 26 consulates general , the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic missions in the US .\nBroadcasting is also an important aspect of Atlantas economy . In the 1980s , media mogul Ted Turner founded the Cable News Network ( CNN ) and the Turner Broadcasting System ( TBS ) in the city . Around the same time , Cox Enterprises , now the nations third-largest cable television service and the publisher of over a dozen American newspapers , moved its headquarters to the city . The Weather Channel is also based just outside of the city in suburban Cobb County .\nInformation technology ( IT ) has become an increasingly important part of Atlantas economic output , earning the city the nickname the Silicon peach . , Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of IT jobs in the US , numbering 85,000+ . The city is also ranked as the sixth fastest-growing for IT jobs , with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9% , or 16,000 jobs . Companies are drawn to Atlantas lower costs and educated workforce .\nRecently , Atlanta has been the center for film and television production , largely because of the Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act , which awards qualified productions a transferable income tax credit of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 or more . Some film and television production facilities based in Atlanta include Turner Studios , Pinewood Atlanta Studios , Tyler Perry Studios , Williams Street Productions , and the EUE/Screen Gems soundstages . Film and television production injected $9.5 billion into Georgias economy in 2017 , with Atlanta garnering most of the projects . Atlanta has emerged as the all-time most popular destination for film production in the United States and one of the ten most popular destinations globally .\nCompared to other American cities , Atlantas economy in the past had been disproportionately affected by the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession , with the citys economy earning a ranking of 68 among 100 American cities in a September 2014 report due to an elevated unemployment rate , declining real income levels , and a depressed housing market . From 2010 to 2011 , Atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and plateauing income growth at 0.4% . Although unemployment had decreased to 7% by late 2014 , this was still higher than the national unemployment rate of 5.8% Atlantas housing market has also struggled , with home prices dropping by 2.1% in January 2012 , reaching levels not seen since 1996 . Compared with a year earlier , the average home price in Atlanta plummeted to 17.3% in February 2012 , thus becoming the largest annual drop in the history of the index for any American or global city . The decline in home prices prompted some economists to deem Atlanta the worst housing market in the nation at the height of the depression . Nevertheless , the citys real estate market has resurged since 2012 , so much median home value and rent growth significantly outpaced the national average by 2018 , thanks to a rapidly-growing regional economy .\nCulture .\nAtlanta is noted for its lack of Southern culture . This is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S. , in addition to many recent immigrants to the U.S . who have made the metropolitan area their home , establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly multi-cultural metropolitan area . Thus , although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlantas cultural fabric , it is mostly a footnote to one of the nations most cosmopolitan cities . This unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of Midtown , the quirky neighborhoods on the citys eastside , and the multi-ethnic enclaves found along Buford Highway .\nArts and theater .\nAtlanta is one of few United States cities with permanent , professional , and resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines : opera ( Atlanta Opera ) , ballet ( Atlanta Ballet ) , orchestral music ( Atlanta Symphony Orchestra ) , and theater ( the Alliance Theatre ) . Atlanta attracts many touring Broadway acts , concerts , shows , and exhibitions catering to a variety of interests . Atlantas performing arts district is concentrated in Midtown Atlanta at the Woodruff Arts Center , which is home to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Alliance Theatre . The city frequently hosts touring Broadway acts , especially at The Fox Theatre , a historic landmark among the highest-grossing theaters of its size .\nAs a national center for the arts , Atlanta is home to significant art museums and institutions . The renowned High Museum of Art is arguably the Souths leading art museum . The Museum of Design Atlanta ( MODA ) and the SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film are the only such museums in the Southeast . Contemporary art museums include the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia . Institutions of higher education contribute to Atlantas art scene , with the Savannah College of Art and Designs Atlanta campus providing the citys arts community with a steady stream of curators , and Emory Universitys Michael C . Carlos Museum containing the largest collection of ancient art in the Southeast . In nearby Athens is the Georgia Museum of Art that is associated with the University of Georgia and is both an academic museum and the official art museum of the state of Georgia .\nAtlanta has become one of the USAs best cities for street art in recent years . It is home to Living Walls , an annual street art conference and the Outerspace Project , an annual event series that merges public art , live music , design , action sports , and culture . Examples of street art in Atlanta can be found on the Atlanta Street Art Map .\nMusic .\nAtlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of American music at different points in the citys history . Beginning as early as the 1920s , Atlanta emerged as a center for country music , which was brought to the city by migrants from Appalachia . During the countercultural 1960s , Atlanta hosted the Atlanta International Pop Festival , with the 1969 festival taking place more than a month before Woodstock and featuring many of the same bands . The city was also a center for Southern rock during its 1970s heyday : the Allman Brothers Bands hit instrumental Hot Lanta is an ode to the city , while Lynyrd Skynyrds famous live rendition of Free Bird was recorded at the Fox Theatre in 1976 , with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant directing the band to play it pretty for Atlanta . During the 1980s , Atlanta had an active punk rock scene centered on two of the citys music venues , 688 Club and the Metroplex , and Atlanta famously played host to the Sex Pistols first U.S . show , which was performed at the Great Southeastern Music Hall . The 1990s saw the city produce major mainstream acts across many different musical genres . Country music artist Travis Tritt , and R&B sensations Xscape , TLC , Usher and Toni Braxton , were just some of the musicians who call Atlanta home . The city also gave birth to Atlanta hip hop , a subgenre that gained relevance and success with the introduction of the home-grown Atlantans known as Outkast , along with other Dungeon Family artists such as Organized Noize and Goodie Mob ; however , it was not until the 2000s that Atlanta moved from the margins to becoming hip-hops center of gravity with another sub-genre called Crunk , part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South and East . Also in the 2000s , Atlanta was recognized by the Brooklyn-based Vice magazine for its indie rock scene , which revolves around the various live music venues found on the citys alternative eastside . To facilitate further local development , the state government provides qualified businesses and productions a 15% transferable income tax credit for in-state costs of music investments . Trap music became popular in Atlanta , and has since become a hub for popular trap artists and producers due to the success of T.I. , Young Jeezy , 21 Savage , Gucci Mane , Future , Migos , Lil Yachty , 2 Chainz and Young Thug .\nFilm and television .\nAs the national leader for motion picture and television production , and a top ten global leader , Atlanta plays a significant role in the entertainment industry .

Three major interstate highways converge in Atlanta : I-20 ( east-west ) , I-75 ( northwest-southeast ) , and I-85 ( northeast-southwest ) . The latter two combine in the middle of the city to form the Downtown Connector ( I-75/85 ) , which carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day and is one of the most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States . Atlanta is mostly encircled by Interstate 285 , a beltway locally known as the Perimeter that has come to mark the boundary between Inside the Perimeter ( ITP ) , the city and close-in suburbs , and Outside the Perimeter ( OTP ) , the outer suburbs and exurbs . The heavy reliance on automobiles for transportation in Atlanta has resulted in traffic , commute , and air pollution rates that rank among the worst in the country . The City of Atlanta has a higher than average percentage of households without a car . In 2015 , 15.2 percent of Atlanta households lacked a car , and increased slightly to 16.4 percent in 2016 . The national average is 8.7 percent in 2016 . Atlanta averaged 1.31 cars per household in 2016 , compared to a national average of 1.8 .\nThe Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority ( MARTA ) provides public transportation in the form of buses , heavy rail , and a downtown light rail loop . Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage in Atlanta , the citys subway system is the eighth busiest in the country . MARTA rail lines connect key destinations , such as the airport , Downtown , Midtown , Buckhead , and Perimeter Center . However , significant destinations , such as Emory University and Cumberland , remain unserved . As a result , a 2011 Brookings Institution study placed Atlanta 91st of 100 metro areas for transit accessibility . Emory University operates its Cliff shuttle buses with 200,000 boardings per month , while private minibuses supply Buford Highway . Amtrak , the national rail passenger system , provides service to Atlanta via the Crescent train ( New York–New Orleans ) , which stops at Peachtree Station . In 2014 , the Atlanta Streetcar opened to the public . The streetcars line , which is also known as the Downtown Loop , runs around the downtown tourist areas of Peachtree Center , Centennial Olympic Park , the Martin Luther King Jr .

The facility offers air service to over 150 U.S . destinations and more than 75 international destinations in 50 countries , with over 2,500 arrivals and departures daily . Delta Air Lines maintains its largest hub at the airport . Situated ( ) south of downtown , the airport covers most of the land inside a wedge formed by Interstate 75 , Interstate 85 , and Interstate 285 .\nCycling is a growing mode of transportation in Atlanta , more than doubling since 2009 , when it comprised 1.1% of all commutes ( up from 0.3% in 2000 ) . Although Atlantas lack of bike lanes and hilly topography may deter many residents from cycling , the citys transportation plan calls for the construction of of bike lanes by 2020 , with the BeltLine helping to achieve this goal . In 2012 , Atlantas first bike track was constructed on 10th Street in Midtown . The two lane bike track runs from Monroe Drive west to Charles Allen Drive , with connections to the Beltline and Piedmont Park . Starting in June 2016 , Atlanta received a bike sharing program , known as Relay Bike Share , with 100 bikes in Downtown and Midtown , which expanded to 500 bikes at 65 stations as of April 2017 .\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey ( five-year average ) , 68.6% of working city of Atlanta residents commuted by driving alone , 7% carpooled , 10% used public transportation , and 4.6% walked . About 2.1% used all other forms of transportation , including taxi , bicycle , and motorcycle . About 7.6% worked at home .\nThe city has also become one of a handful of scooter capitals , where companies like Lime and Bird have gained a major foothold by placing electric scooters on street corners and byways .\nTree canopy .\nAtlanta has a reputation as a city in a forest due to an abundance of trees that is rare among major cities . The citys main street is named after a tree , and beyond the Downtown , Midtown , and Buckhead business districts , the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs . The city is home to the Atlanta Dogwood Festival , an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April , when the native dogwoods are in bloom . The nickname is factually accurate , as vegetation covers 47.9% of the city as of 2017 , the highest among all major American cities , and well above the national average of 27% . Atlantas tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by National Geographic in naming Atlanta a Place of a Lifetime .\nThe citys lush tree canopy , which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings , has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains , drought , aged forests , new pests , and urban construction . A 2001 study found Atlantas heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996 . Community organizations and the city government are addressing the problem . Trees Atlanta , a non-profit organization founded in 1985 , has planted and distributed over 113,000 shade trees in the city , and Atlantas government has awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees . Fees are additionally imposed on developers that remove trees on their property per a citywide ordinance , active since 1993 .\nSister cities .\nAtlantas sister cities are :\n- Montego Bay , Jamaica ( 1972 )\n- Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ( 1972 )\n- Lagos , Nigeria ( 1974 )\n- Toulouse , France ( 1974 )\n- Newcastle upon Tyne , England , UK ( 1977 )\n- Taipei , Taiwan ( 1979 )\n- Daegu , South Korea ( 1981 )\n- Brussels , Belgium ( 1983 )\n- Port of Spain , Trinidad and Tobago ( 1987 )\n- Tbilisi , Georgia ( 1988 )\n- Olympia , Greece ( 1994 )\n- Bucharest , Romania ( 1994 )\n- Cotonou , Benin ( 1995 )\n- Salcedo , Dominican Republic ( 1996 )\n- Nuremberg , Germany ( 1998 )\n- Raanana , Israel ( 2000 )\n- Fukuoka , Japan ( 2005 )\nFurther reading .\n- Atlanta and Environs : A Chronicle of Its People and Events : Years of Change and Challenge , 1940–1976 by Franklin M .

He and former wife Joanna had a son , who died shortly after birth , and a daughter . He has a son with partner Kerry Clarke .\nClub career .\nQueens Park Rangers .\nHe began his career in London as a trainee with Queens Park Rangers in August 1995 , making his League debut in a 2–1 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford a few months later in December 1995 . He was used sparingly for the remainder of that campaign , making eleven appearances as QPR were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 1995–96 season . He made a further 13 appearances in the 1996–97 season before breaking into the first eleven on a regular basis in the 1997–98 season when he made 34 league and cup appearances .\nNottingham Forest .\nQuashie joined Premier League side Nottingham Forest for £2.5 million at the start of the 1998–99 season but made only 18 appearances as Forest were comfortably relegated .

By July , he reportedly had attracted interest from several clubs , including West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City with Portsmouth understood to have made an offer .\nPortsmouth .\nQuashie joined Portsmouth in August 2000 for a fee worth up to £600,000 , signing a three-year contract . He quickly established himself in the first-team , making 37 league and cup appearances in the 2001–02 season as Portsmouth finished in the lower half of the First Division . He made a further 44 appearances in the 2002–03 season and was club vice-captain when Portsmouth won the First Division championship and were promoted to the Premier League . No sooner had he returned from a six-week layoff with a knee injury in December 2003 than he suffered an injury to his opposite knee leading him to miss a further six weeks of the 2003–04 season . However , Quashie remained a first choice player , making 25 appearances as Portsmouth claimed 13th place in the Premier League . Although Quashie was a regular starter in the 2004–05 season and club captain , he had not been offered a new contract despite being out of contract at the end of the season and joined former Portsmouth manager , Harry Redknapp , at Southampton during the January 2005 transfer window .\nSouthampton .\nQuashie joined Southampton for a fee of £2.1 million in January 2005 , signing a three-and-a-half-year contract . He said , Its a big move for me and I am happy to be linking up with Harry Redknapp again . I am certain we will stay up – I would not have come here if I had any doubts about that , but we need to get a few results quickly . The chairman of Southampton , Rupert Lowe , said , Harry really wanted Nigel – he thinks he is a strong character who will add to the dressing room . We are delighted to make him our third signing since Harry arrived . A training ground injury prevented Quashie from making his debut against Liverpool on 22 January 2005 and he did not make his debut until the match against Everton on 6 February .\nAfter the transfer of Jason Dodd , he became the clubs captain but he was unable to prevent the Saints being relegated at the end of the 2004–05 season . Despite relegation , Quashie said that he had no regrets over the move to Southampton as he had been unhappy with the way he had been treated at Portsmouth . However , following Redknapps departure and his replacement with George Burley , Quashie was allowed to leave Southampton in the January 2006 transfer window .\nWest Bromwich Albion .\nQuashie joined West Bromwich Albion in January 2006 for £1.2 million , signing a three-and-a-half-year contract . Manager Bryan Robson , I always liked Nigel when he played for QPR , Portsmouth and Southampton . He is intelligent , has good stamina and is a very good passer of the ball . He has got the experience now of relegation fights and playing in the Premiership . I just feel he will improve our squad . He made his debut for Albion in a 2–0 Premier League win over Blackburn Rovers on 4 February 2006 . He was charged with misconduct by the Football Association after being sent off against Middlesbrough three weeks later for alleged use of foul and abusive language towards the referees assistants as he left the pitch and was given a one-game ban in addition to a four-game ban for the sending off , his second of the season , and a £5,000 fine after admitting misconduct . His only goal for the club came in a 3–1 defeat against Arsenal in April 2006 . Albion were relegated at the end of the season . Quashie achieved the rare distinction of being relegated from the Premiership in two successive seasons . Following relegation , Quashie was allowed to leave in the January 2007 transfer window as he expressed a wish to return to the Premier League and manager , Tony Mowbray , wanted to raise some revenue to bring in new players .\nWest Ham United .\nQuashie became Alan Curbishleys second signing of the transfer window when he joined West Ham United on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an initial fee of £1.5 million , rising to £1.75 million after West Ham successfully avoided relegation in the 2006–07 season . Curbishley explained that he had signed Quashie ...because he is an experienced player who will add competition to our central midfield positions [ ... ] The competition for places is a factor that will be important to us as we fight to move up the table.. . Quashie made his debut against Fulham a few days later and went on to make eight appearances , none of them on the winning side , as West Ham battled against relegation .\nA persistent foot injury meant that Quashie did not play a single competitive match during 2007–08 . He made his comeback in a friendly match against Queens Park Rangers in August 2008 . The signing of Swiss international Valon Behrami in the summer of 2008 and the emergence of academy graduates Jack Collison and Junior Stanislas meant that competition for midfield places was much stiffer . In January 2010 he was released by West Ham and rejoined QPR .\nBirmingham City .\nQuashie trained with Birmingham City of the Championship for several weeks to regain fitness before signing on loan , initially for a month , on 22 October 2008 . He went straight into the squad for that days match against Crystal Palace , and made his debut as a second-half substitute . Despite missing the last game of his initial loan spell through suspension , having been sent off in the match against Charlton Athletic , the loan was extended for a further month , and again for a third and final month , until 17 January 2009 . Quashie returned to West Ham on 19 January , having played 11 times for Birmingham .\nWolverhampton Wanderers .\nQuashie joined Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2009 on loan until the end of the season . He made three consecutive appearances for the team before quickly dropping out of contention as the club won promotion to the Premier League as champions .\nMilton Keynes Dons .\nIn November 2009 Quashie joined League One side Milton Keynes Dons on loan until 3 January 2010 . He made a losing start to his MK Dons career coming on in the first half for Luke Howell in the 4–3 home defeat to Carlisle United on 24 November . Quashie scored his first goal for MK Dons on 12 December in a 2–1 away win against Leyton Orient . In total in seven League games he scored two goals .\nReturn to Queens Park Rangers .\nQuashie returned to his first professional club , Queens Park Rangers on 22 January 2010 , stating ; Its great to be back home , and I am delighted to be at a club that I love to pieces . He made his second QPR debut in the 5–0 defeat at one of his former clubs , Nottingham Forest . Quashie was released by QPR at the end of the 2009–10 season .\nÍþróttafélag Reykjavíkur .\nOn 13 April 2012 , Quashie joined 1 . deild karla side Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur on a two-year contract as both a player and as assistant manager to Andri Marteinsson . He is also a coach in the ÍR academy . Quashie made his league debut for ÍR on 12 May 2012 and scored the teams second goal in the 3–2 win against KA . Following the dismissal of manager Andri Marteinsson on 21 August 2012 with ÍR at the bottom of the division , Quashie was appointed to take charge of the team until the end of the 2012 season .\nBÍ/Bolungarvík .\nIn January 2013 , Quashie signed a 3-year contract with 1 . deild karla club BÍ/Bolungarvík . He also served as assistant coach in all three seasons . He retired from playing football following the 2015 season .\nInternational career .\nAfter several impressive performances for QPR , Quashie was awarded four England Under-21 and an England B caps . He is eligible to play for the Scottish national football team through a Scottish grandfather and , given the opportunity to play international football for Scotland in April 2004 , said I have been asked to prove my grandfather came from Scotland , but that is no problem . He was born in Glasgow and Id be very interested in playing for Scotland . Id never given up hope of forcing my way into the full England set-up but I would consider playing for Scotland .\nQuashie switched his allegiance to Scotland and made his international debut against Estonia in May 2004 . Quashie thus became only the second black player to represent Scotland ( after Andrew Watson in 1881 ) and the third non white person ( after Paul Wilson in 1975 ) . He scored in his second game , a 4–1 win over Trinidad and Tobago , a few days later . Berti Vogts said of him , Nigel is a fantastic player and a real leader on the pitch . He feels so Scottish and thats great . In total Quashie made 14 appearances for Scotland , scoring one goal .\nExternal links .\n- Nigel Quashie profile at whufc.com ( West Ham United official website )",

    "story": "Laurence Harvey\nLaurence Harvey ( born Zvi Mosheh Skikne ; 1 October 192825 November 1973 ) was a Lithuanian-born British actor and film director . He was born to Lithuanian Jewish parents and emigrated to South Africa at an early age , before later settling in the United Kingdom after World War II . In a career that spanned a quarter of a century , Harvey appeared in stage , film and television productions primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States .\nKnown for his clipped , refined accent and cool , debonair screen persona ; his performance in Room at the Top ( 1959 ) resulted in an Academy Award nomination . That success was followed by the roles of William Barret Travis in The Alamo and Weston Liggett in Butterfield 8 , both films released in the autumn of 1960 . He also appeared as the brainwashed Sergeant Raymond Shaw in The Manchurian Candidate ( 1962 ) . He made his directorial debut with The Ceremony ( 1963 ) . He continued acting into the 1970s , until his sudden death in 1973 of cancer .\nEarly life and career .\nSouth Africa .\nHarvey was born in Joniškis , Lithuania , the youngest of three sons of Ella ( née Zotnickaita ) and Ber Skikne , Lithuanian Jewish parents . His civil birth name was Laruschka Mischa Skikne . His Hebrew name was Zvi Mosheh . When he was five years old , his family traveled with the family of Riva Segal and her two sons , Louis and Charles Segal on the to South Africa , where he was known as Harry Skikne . Harvey grew up in Johannesburg . He was only fifteen when he auditioned to join the Entertainment Unit of the South African Army during the Second World War . Sid James managed the Unit and approved his audition . They become long-time friends . As the Mystery Guest on USA TV show Whats My Line ? screened 1 May 1960 , he states he arrived in South Africa in 1934 and moved to the UK in 1946 .\nMove to Britain .\nAfter moving to London , he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , but left RADA after three months .\nBilled as Larry Skikne , he appeared in the play Uprooted at the Comedy Theatre in 1947 . He also appeared on stage at the Library Theatre in Manchester . His performances in Manchester led to him being cast in his first film .\nFilm debut and new name .\nHarvey made his cinema debut in the British film House of Darkness ( 1948 ) , but its distributor British Lion thought someone named Larry Skikne was not commercially viable . Accounts vary as to how the actor acquired his stage name of Laurence Harvey . One version has it that it was the idea of talent agent Gordon Harbord who decided Laurence would be an appropriate first name . In choosing a British-sounding last name , Harbord thought of two British retail institutions , Harvey Nichols and Harrods . Another is that Skikne was travelling on a London bus with Sid James who exclaimed during their journey : Its either Laurence Nichols or Laurence Harvey . Harveys own account differed over time .\nAssociated British Picture Corporation and leading man .\nAssociated British Picture Corporation quickly offered him a two-year contract , which Harvey accepted . He appeared in supporting roles in several of their lower-budget films such as Man on the Run ( 1949 ) , Landfall ( 1949 ) ( directed by Ken Annakin ) and The Dancing Years ( 1950 ) . For International Motion Pictures he was in The Man from Yesterday ( 1949 ) .\nMayflower Productions , which released through Associated British , gave Harvey his first lead , appearing alongside Eric Portman in the Egypt-set police film Cairo Road ( 1950 ) . It was a minor success .\nHe had a small role in the Hollywood financed The Black Rose ( 1950 ) , starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles , directed by Henry Hathaway . It was Harveys first experience in a Hollywood film . He played Cassio in a version of Othello for BBC TV starring Andre Morell .\nHarvey starred in leading roles for two B-pictures for director Lewis Gilbert at Nettleford Films : Scarlet Thread ( 1951 ) and There Is Another Sun ( 1951 ) . For Ealing , he made I Believe in You ( 1952 ) , directed by Basil Dearden . According to Sight and Sound this performance gave an indication of Harveys true metier . While Basil Deardens direction focused on honest Harry Fowler , it was Harveys Jordie who supplied an authentic glimpse of pin-table thuggery , his clothes and hairstyle on the cusp between cosh-boy and ted and his manner redolent of a languorous sexuality no amount of National Service could quell .\nHe starred in the low-budget thriller A Killer Walks ( 1952 ) . In 1951 he appeared on stage in Hassan at the Cambridge Theatre .\nRomulus Films .\nHarveys career gained a boost when he appeared in Women of Twilight ( 1952 ) ; this was made by Romulus Films run by brothers John and James Woolf , who signed Harvey to a long-term contract . James Woolf in particular was a big admirer of Harvey and played an important role in turning the actor into a star .\nIn 1953 he played Orlando on a BBC TV version of As You Like It , opposite Margaret Leighton , whom he would later marry .\nRomulus put him in two ensemble films : a comedy , Innocents in Paris ( 1953 ) and a crime thriller , The Good Die Young ( 1954 ) . He had an especially strong role in the latter , which was directed by Lewis Gilbert , and featured Hollywood actors such as John Ireland , Richard Basehart and Gloria Grahame , along with Leighton . This has been called his first performance of note .\nHarvey received an offer to play the juvenile male lead in the Hollywood spectacular King Richard and the Crusaders ( 1954 ) , a medieval swashbuckler for Warner Bros starring Rex Harrison , Virginia Mayo and George Sanders . It was a box-office disappointment , although Harveys performance was well received .\nHarvey played Romeo in Renato Castellanis adaptation of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet ( 1954 ) , narrated by John Gielgud . His performance was generally not well received . According to a contemporary interview , he turned down an offer to appear in Helen of Troy ( 1955 ) to act at Stratford-upon-Avon , where he again performed in Romeo and Juliet , this time on stage .\nRomulus gave Harvey another excellent chance when he was cast as the writer Christopher Isherwood in I Am A Camera ( 1955 ) , with Julie Harris as Sally Bowles . He and Leighton starred in an adaptation of A Month in the Country for ITV Play of the Week ( 1955 ) . He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play Island of Goats , a flop that closed after one week , though his performance won him a 1956 Theatre World Award . While in the US he appeared on TV in an episode of The Alcoa Hour called The Small Servant , co starring Diane Cilento .\nZoltan Korda used him as one of the soldiers in Storm Over the Nile ( 1955 ) , a remake of The Four Feathers ( 1939 ) , playing the part taken by Ralph Richardson in the 1939 version . It was popular in Britain as was the comedy Three Men in a Boat ( 1956 ) , made for Romulus under the direction of Ken Annakin .\nHarvey appeared in The Bet for ITV Television Playhouse ( 1956 ) then did another for Romulus , After the Ball ( 1957 ) , a biopic of Vesta Tilley , in which Harvey played Walter de Frece . He followed it with The Truth About Women ( 1958 ) , a comedy directed by Muriel Box for Beaconsfield Productions .\nHarvey returned to Broadway in 1957 to appear alongside Julie Harris , Pamela Brown and Colleen Dewhurst in William Wycherleys The Country Wife ( a production he had originally starred in at Londons Royal Court Theatre ) .\nFor Romulus , Harvey starred in The Silent Enemy ( 1958 ) , with his old friend Sid James , a biopic of war hero Lionel Crabb .\nInternational stardom .\nRoom at the Top .\nHarveys breakthrough to international stardom came after he was cast by director Jack Clayton as the social climber Joe Lampton in Room at the Top ( 1959 ) , produced by Romulus . For his performance , Harvey received a BAFTA Award nomination and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Simone Signoret and Heather Sears co-starred as Lamptons married lover and eventual wife respectively . It was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1959 and a hit in the U.S .\nHarvey went to Broadway in 1958 , as Shakespeares Henry V , as part of the Old Vic company , which featured a young Judi Dench as Katherine , the daughter of the king of France .\nHarvey followed it with the musical Expresso Bongo ( 1959 ) , a film best remembered for introducing Cliff Richard . He did The Violent Years for the ITV Play of the Week ( 1959 ) .\nWhile in the US he appeared in Arthur , an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents directed by Hitchcock himself .\nHollywood .\nThe success of Room at the Top led to Hollywood offers and Harvey decided to spend the next three years focusing on films . He was in John Waynes epic The Alamo ( 1960 ) , being John Waynes personal choice to play Alamo commandant William Barret Travis . He had been impressed by Harveys talent and ability to project the aristocratic demeanor Wayne believed Travis possessed . Harvey and Wayne later expressed their mutual admiration and satisfaction at having worked together . The Alamo was a hit ( although the enormous cost meant the film lost money ) .\nEven more successful was Harveys next Hollywood film , MGMs BUtterfield 8 ( 1960 ) , which won Elizabeth Taylor her first Oscar . He was named for The Eddie Chapman Story but it was not made until years later , as Triple Cross with Christopher Plummer .\nBack in Britain , Harvey was cast in the film version of The Long and the Short and the Tall ( 1961 ) in a role originally performed by Peter OToole during the plays West End run . He clashed with Richard Todd and Richard Harris during filming but the movie was a hit in Britain . He was announced for some films that were not made ( The Disenchanted from the novel by Budd Schulberg , No Bail for the Judge , from Alfred Hitchcock The Lion , The Long Walk ) and films made with other actors The Greengage Summer ) .\nIn the U.S. , he supported Shirley MacLaine in MGMs Two Loves ( 1961 ) and co-starred with Geraldine Page in the film adaptation of Tennessee Williamss Summer and Smoke ( 1961 ) , directed by Peter Glenville . He signed to appear in the film of Five Finger Exercise but was not in the eventual film . His fee around this time was $300,000 a film .\nHarvey played the male lead in Walk on the Wild Side ( 1962 ) , produced by Charles Feldman ; he was cast alongside Barbara Stanwyck , Jane Fonda and Capucine . Fonda was not positive about the experience of working with him : There are actors and actors – and then there are the Laurence Harveys . With them , its like acting by yourself . The same year , he recorded an album of spoken excerpts from the book This Is My Beloved by Walter Benton , accompanied by original music by Herbie Mann . It was released on the Atlantic label . He narrated a TV musical , The Flood ( 1962 ) .\nMGM cast Harvey as Wilhelm Grimm in the MGM film The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm ( 1962 ) , produced by George Pal . Harveys performance earned him a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama . The fantasy movie filmed in 3-strip Cinerama was a box office disappointment .\nHarvey appeared as the brainwashed US Army Captain Raymond Shaw in the Cold War thriller The Manchurian Candidate ( 1962 ) , directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury . Film critic David Shipman wrote unkindly : Harveys role required him to act like a zombie and several critics cited it as his first convincing performance . The movie was a hit and has since become critically highly regarded , and is one of Harveys better-remembered films .\nHarvey went to Japan to make A Girl Named Tamiko ( 1962 ) with France Nuyen for director John Sturges and producer Hal Wallis . I have suddenly found the gates of Hollywood opened to me , he said at the time .\nHe followed this with The Running Man ( 1963 ) , directed by Carol Reed , with Lee Remick and Alan Bates .\nDirector .\nHarvey made his directorial debut with The Ceremony ( 1963 ) , in which he also starred . It was shot in Spain for United Artists .\nHarvey played King Arthur in the 1964 London production of the Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe musical Camelot at Drury Lane .\nHe was the male lead in an adaptation of W . Somerset Maughams Of Human Bondage ( 1964 ) , co starring Kim Novak . Harvey had been connected to the project for several years . It was a troubled shoot , with Harvey and Novak clashing , and original director Henry Hathaway leaving during the shoot and being replaced by Ken Hughes . During filming , kidnap threats were made against both Harvey and Novak by student organisations .\nThe Outrage ( 1964 ) was director Martin Ritts remake of Akira Kurosawas Japanese film Rashomon ( 1950 ) . Besides Harvey , the film starred Paul Newman and Claire Bloom , but was unsuccessful critically and commercially .\nHarvey reprised his role as Joe Lampton in Life at the Top ( 1965 ) , directed by Ted Kotcheff . This is considered one of his best later performances .\nHarvey had his first commercially successful film in a number of years with Darling ( 1965 ) , starring Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde . While Harveys role in the film is short , his involvement enabled director John Schlesinger to raise financial backing for the project . Harvey starred in a version of The Doctor and the Devils directed by Nicholas Ray from a script by Dylan Thomas but the film was not completed .\nHarvey co-starred with Israeli actress Daliah Lavi in the comedy The Spy with a Cold Nose ( 1966 ) , a parody of the James Bond films . Harvey did The Winters Tale ( 1967 ) and then Dial M for Murder ( 1967 ) for American TV .\nCharge of the Light Brigade .\nHarvey owned the rights to the book on which John Osbornes early script for the film The Charge of the Light Brigade ( 1968 ) was partially based , Cecil Woodham-Smiths book The Reason Why ( 1953 ) . He intended to make his own version . A lawsuit was filed against director Tony Richardsons company Woodfall Film Productions on behalf of the books author . There was a monetary settlement , and Harvey insisted on being cast in a cameo role ( being cast as Prince Radziwill ) as part of the agreement for which he was paid £60,000 . Charles Wood was brought in to re-write the script . Harveys scenes were cut from the movie at Richardsons insistence except for a brief glimpse as an anonymous member of a theatre audience which , technically , still met the requirements of the legal settlement . John Osborne asserted in his autobiography that Richardson shot the scenes with Harvey French , which is film jargon for a director going-through-the-motions because of some obligation , but with no film in the camera .\nHarvey completed direction of the spy thriller A Dandy in Aspic ( 1968 ) after director Anthony Mann died during production . The film co-stars Mia Farrow . This has been called his last effective cinema role.. . The critics greeted it with disdain but the plot was tailor-made for Harvey , who plays a Russian spy who has adopted an English identity so he can go undercover within British Intelligence .\nHarvey provided the narration for the Soviet film Tchaikovsky ( 1969 ) , directed by Igor Talankin .\nLater career .\nHarvey co-starred with Ann-Margret in Rebus ( 1969 ) then appeared in Kampf um Rom ( 1970 ) , a film set in Ancient Rome . The latter starred Orson Welles , who directed Harvey in The Deep , a thriller that was abandoned .\nHarvey starred in She and He ( 1969 ) which he helped produce .\nHarvey had a cameo role as himself in The Magic Christian ( 1969 ) , a film based on the Terry Southern novel of the same name . He gives a rendition of Hamlets soliloquy that develops unexpectedly into a campy striptease routine .\nHe had a small role in WUSA ( 1970 ) and was guest murderer on Columbo : The Most Dangerous Match in 1973 , portraying a chess champion who kills his opponent . For British TV he appeared in a version of Arms and the Man for ITV Sunday Night Theatre ( 1971 ) . Joanna Pettet appeared with Harvey in an episode of Rod Serlings Night Gallery ( The Caterpillar , 1972 ) , in which Harveys character attempts to assassinate a romantic rival by having a burrowing insect dropped in the mans ear .\nHarvey starred in Escape to the Sun ( 1972 ) , directed by Menahem Golan and was reunited with Elizabeth Taylor in Night Watch ( 1973 ) . Night Watch was financed by Brut Productions who also financed Welcome to Arrow Beach ( 1974 ) which Harvey directed and starred in ; the cast also included his friend Pettet , John Ireland and Stuart Whitman . The film deals with a type of war-related post-traumatic stress disorder that turns a military veteran to cannibalism .\nFinal plans .\nIn August 1973,it was reported Harvey had been ill , but he assured people he was busier than ever . Just before he died , he was planning to star in and direct two films : one on Kitty Genovese , the other a Wolf Mankowitz comedy titled Cockatrice . His death put an end to any hope that Orson Welless The Deep would be completed . With Harvey and Jeanne Moreau in the leading roles , Welles worked on the film between his other projects , although the production was hampered by financial problems .\nPersonal life .\nHe met Hermione Baddeley , an established actress , when they were cast in the film “There is another sun” in 1950 . She became his “live-in” partner and a lucky charm for his career . She introduced him to Basil Dean and his first part on the London stage in “Hassan” , followed by a season at Stratford in 1952 with Glen Byam Shaw . Most significantly , she introduced him to James Woolf , of Romulus Films . He became his mentor , manager and lover , over the next 14 years . He made Laurence Harvey a star . Harvey left Baddeley in 1952 for actress Margaret Leighton , who was then married to publisher Max Reinhardt . Leighton and Reinhardt divorced in 1955 , and she married Harvey in 1957 off the Rock of Gibraltar . The couple divorced in 1961 .\nIn 1968 he married Joan Perry , the widow of film mogul Harry Cohn . Her marriage to Harvey lasted until 1972 .\nHis third marriage was to British fashion model Paulene Stone . She gave birth to their daughter Domino in 1969 while he was still married to Perry . Harvey and Stone married in 1972 and soon after , he adopted her child from her previous marriage , Sophie Norris ( now Sophie Harvey ) . The wedding took place at the home of Harold Robbins .\nIn his account of being Frank Sinatras valet , Mr . S : My Life with Frank Sinatra ( 2003 ) , George Jacobs writes that Harvey often made passes at him while visiting Sinatra . According to Jacobs , Sinatra was aware of Harveys sexuality . In his autobiography Close Up ( 2004 ) , British actor John Fraser claimed Harvey was gay and that his long-term lover was Harveys manager James Woolf , who had cast Harvey in several of the films he produced in the 1950s .\nAfter working in two films with her , Harvey remained friends with Elizabeth Taylor for the rest of his life . She visited him three weeks before he died . Upon his death , Taylor issued the statement : He was one of the people I really loved in this world . He was part of the sun . For everyone who loved him , the sun is a bit dimmer . She and Peter Lawford held a memorial service for Harvey in California .\nHarvey once responded to an assertion about himself : Someone once asked me , Why is it so many people hate you ? and I said , Do they ? How super ! Im really quite pleased about it .\nDeath .\nA heavy smoker and drinker , Harvey died at the age of 45 from stomach cancer in Hampstead , north London , on 25 November 1973 .\nHis daughter Domino , who later became a bounty hunter , was only four years old at the time . She died at the age of 35 , in 2005 , after overdosing on painkillers . They are buried together in Santa Barbara Cemetery in Santa Barbara , California .\nAppraisal .\nAccording to his obituary in The New York Times :\nWith his clipped speech , cool smile and a cigarette dangling impudently from his lips , Laurence Harvey established himself as the screens perfect pin-striped cad . He could project such utter boredom that willowy debutantes would shrivel in his presence . He could also exude such charm that the same young ladies would gladly lend him their hearts , which were usually returned utterly broken.. . The image Mr Harvey carefully fostered for himself off screen was not far removed from some of the roles he played . Im a flamboyant character , an extrovert who doesnt want to reveal his feelings , he once said . To bare your soul to the world , I find unutterably boring . I think part of our profession is to have a quixotic personality .\nAccording to Sight and Sound Any young actor who delighted in pink bathroom suites and liked to compare himself favourably to Olivier , Gielgud and Richardson – preferably in the same sentence – was clearly going to find it hard to fit the mould of New Elizabethan chappism promoted by Rank and ABPC.. . Harvey flaunted a cigarette holder almost as parodie as Terry Thomas and boasted that his drainpipe trousers pre-dated the teddy boys . His hairstyle always tended towards the baroque and quickly became a trademark\nAwards and nominations .\n- 1956 Theatre World Award .\n- 1959 Nomination BAFTA Award for Best British Actor\n- 1960 Nomination BAFTA Award for Best British Actor\n- 1959 Nomination Academy Award for Best Actor\n- 1960 Nominated Laurel Award Top Male New Personality\n- 1963 Nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama .\nActing credits .\nFilm .\nNote : Where British Film Institute ( BFI ) and American Film Institute ( AFI ) differed on release year , or if the Wikipedia article title had a different release year , whichever source is the country of production is the year used .\nFurther reading .\n- Hickey , Des and Smith , Gus .

    "story": "Declan Devine\nDeclan Devine ( born 15 September 1973 in Derry ) is an Irish football manager and former footballer who has played for and managed his hometown club Derry City in the League of Ireland Premier Division .\nPlaying career .\nDevine began his career with Ipswich Town but was unable to make the breakthrough at Portman Road and returned home . Devine then plied his trade with a number of Irish League clubs as well as Derry City and won the Ulster Young Footballer of the Year Award in 1994 when playing for Roy McCreadies Omagh Town side . Devine was capped right up to U-21 level with Northern Ireland , winning an U-21 cap in a 0–0 draw against Romania in 1994 .\nHe tasted success with Glentoran , helping them to defeat Glenavon in the Irish Cup final in the 1995–96 season . However , at the end of that season Devine moved to the Brandywell for a combined fee of £42,000 which included Liam Coyle , where he provided backup to Tony ODowd as Derry City went on to win the title . Devine was restricted to a limited number of appearances and his highest profile appearance was that in the 1997 FAI Cup final . Derry City , aiming for the double , were rocked with the news of the sudden death of the younger brother of Tony ODowd just days before the final and Devine stepped up to take his place between the sticks . They were defeated 2–0 by Shelbourne in Dalymount Park on a weekend where football very much took a back seat .\nDevine remained at the Brandywell for the start of the 1997–98 season but again found his opportunities limited and returned to Omagh Town . He was on the move again the following season and ended up with Institute , becoming one of the many players who have played for the two clubs in the Derry .\nManagerial career .\nHaving stopped playing at the end of the 2001–02 season , Devine became involved in coaching at an underage level . He returned to Derry City as the Youth Development officer in 2003 and was initially involved in the delivery of the community coaching and Football in the Community programmes which were run by the club at that time . The installation of former teammate , Gavin Dykes , as manager in 2003 meant a promotion for Devine and he took on the role of first team coach . Stephen Kenny opted to retain Devine as first team coach when he arrived at the club the following season , and the back room setup , including Paul Hegarty , guided Derry City to successive second-place finishes as well as success in the FAI Cup , League Cup and memorable European runs . Following this success , Kenny lured Devine to join him at Dunfermline Athletic when he left for East End Park and he was appointed first team coach there on 5 December 2006 . Devine described the move as a massive wrench but felt for personal reasons that he needed to move on . However , after Stephen Kennys return to Derry City in late 2007 , Devine , too followed him back to the club . He was instrumental in guiding the team to the First Division title and a third-place finish in the 2011 season .\nFollowing the departure of Stephen Kenny to Shamrock Rovers in December 2011 , Devine was appointed manager of Derry City on 6 January 2012 , beating off Willie McStay to land the post . He agreed a two-year deal along with Paul Hegarty who was appointed as his assistant manager . In his first season in charge , the club finished 5th in the league , won the FAI Cup , and were runners-up in the Setanta Sports Cup . In the wake of this success , Devine signed a one-year contract extension to keep him at the club until the end of the 2014 season . At the beginning of his second season in charge , after an opening day defeat to Sligo Rovers , Devine guided his team to a 10-match unbeaten run and top of the table until they were defeated again by Sligo in the second series of fixtures . Devine left by mutual consent at the end of the season despite having qualified for Europe and a 6-0 victory against Limerick . Prior to the 2014 League of Ireland season , Devine was linked with the assistant manager post at champions St . Patricks Athletic , however he turned this down in favour of becoming an underage coach in the Elite Performance Club NI scheme . Devine , along with former Derry City player Pascal Vaudequin , will work with youth players in the west of Northern Ireland .\nHonours .\nAs a player .\n- League of Ireland : 1\n- Derry City – 1996–97\n- Irish Cup : 1\n- Glentoran – 1995–96\n- Ulster Young Footballer of the Year\n- Omagh Town – 1994–95\nAs a manager .\n- FAI Cup\n- Derry City F.C . 2012\nManagerial statistics .\nManagerial record .\n.

    "story": "GER Class T26\nThe GER Class T26 was a class of steam tender locomotives designed by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway . At the 1923 grouping they passed to the London and North Eastern Railway , who classified them E4 . Eighteen survived into British Railways ownership in 1948 , and the last was withdrawn in 1959 , making them the last s at work in Britain . Their BR numbers were 62780–62797 .\nOverview .\nDerived from the GER Class T19 but with much smaller driving wheels and intended for mixed traffic work , ninety T26s were built between 1891 and 1896 with cylinders ( later ) and boiler pressure , numbered 417–506 . From 1898 some locos were rebuilt with pressure boilers thus when an additional ten T26s ( numbers 1250–1259 ) were built in 1902 these were fitted with the new boilers as standard .\nOperation .\nThe GER used air brakes but , when introduced , more than half the T26 locomotives were additionally fitted with vacuum brake ejectors for operating over the lines of other railway companies . T26s were particularly associated with the movement of horses by rail to and from Newmarket Racecourse , and thus travelled widely .\nT26s were often used on passenger trains to the Norfolk Coast , particularly Wells and Cromer . After the grouping of 1923 Claud Hamilton s took over most passenger traffic to Wells .\nAccidents and incidents .\n- On 12 July 1913 , locomotive No . 471 was run into by an express passenger train at , Essex due to a signalmans error . Three people were killed and fourteen were injured .\n- On 20 January 1915 , at County School railway station , the junction of the line to Aylsham and Wroxham , Y14 629 , hauling 12 empty and 4 loaded wagons , ran into the 6 coach passenger train , hauled by T26 locomotive 446 . Nobody was injured in the crash , which took place at low speed , although both locomotives were damaged , along with other vehicles in both trains .\n- On 27 May 1931 , locomotive No . 7486 was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was in a head-on collision with a passenger train hauled by locomotive No . 7457 at station , Norfolk . One person was killed and fifteen were injured .\nLivery .\nOn introduction the T26 locomotives were painted in the standard GER livery of Ultramarine Blue over an undercoat of French Grey , with black smokebox and vermillion buffer beams and lining . From 1915 locos were not given a top coat and ran in French Grey undercoat but with the boiler bands picked out in black . After the amalgamation of the GER into the LNER in 1923 ( the Grouping ) , the E4s received the LNER mixed traffic livery of black with single red lining and red buffer beams . This lasted until the early 1940s when unlined black with red buffer beams was introduced , and the surviving locos were to carry this livery until their withdrawal .\nPreservation .\nOne ( GER No . 490 , BR No . 62785 ) has survived to form a part of the National Collection and is currently located at Bressingham Steam Museum . There are Transacord recordings of their gentle chuffing through the byways of East Anglia .",
